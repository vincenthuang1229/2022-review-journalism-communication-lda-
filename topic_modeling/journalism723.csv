An online experiment was performed with 344 adults in the United States. The results showed that rebuttals by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, rather than those by social media users, indirectly increased people's willingness to receive the vaccine by reducing their psychological reactance to persuasive messages and their belief in the misinformation contained in the comments. Rebuttals by social media users became more effective in reducing reactance when people initially had stronger pro-vaccination attitudes.","[Sun, Yanqing] Hunan Univ, Sch Journalism & Commun, 311 Lushan Rd, Changsha 410082, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Lu, Fangcao] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Media & Commun, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Hunan University; City University of Hong Kong,"Sun, YQ (corresponding author), Hunan Univ, Sch Journalism & Commun, 311 Lushan Rd, Changsha 410082, Hunan, Peoples R China.",yanqingsun@hnu.edu.cn,,"SUN, Yanqing/0000-0002-3022-369X; LU, Fangcao/0000-0003-4479-1177",,,,,92,0,0,12,23,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1077-6990,2161-430X,,J MASS COMMUN Q,Journal.

This research investigated how CSR messages influences consumer evaluations of a CSR activity supporting women's empowerment via consumers' cause involvement by conducting two experimental studies. In Study 1, a 2 (CSR message type: in-group vs. out-group) x 2 (gender: female vs. male) online factorial experiment (n = 140) was employed. The results indicate that consumers evaluated the CSR activity more positively when they were exposed to an in-group message than an out-group message. To increase the validity and explain the process by which CSR message types influence consumer evaluations of a CSR activity, Study 2 was conducted. Psychological distance manipulated by CSR campaign messages increased an individual's level of cause involvement, which in turn influenced the individuals' response to the CSR activities.

While our results contain some good news for public relations practitioners, they also carry a warning for consumers of journalism and for the public science agenda, which may be left vulnerable to bad actors undermining the trust that the public, and journalists, have in science.

Journalists saw social media as creating an opening for objectivity to move from an orthodox value to a debatable heterodox one.

Negative sexual consequences were significantly more likely to be experienced by female characters than male characters within shows that primarily featured teens, thus reinforcing a discourse of sexual risk and danger for teen girls.","[Aubrey, Jennifer Stevens] Univ Arizona, Commun, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Roberts, Lindsay] Univ Arizona, 1103 E Univ Blvd, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Aubrey, Jennifer Stevens] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Miller, Brandon] Univ Massachusetts, Boston, MA 02125 USA; [Miller, Brandon] Univ Missouri, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Bond, Bradley J.] Univ San Diego, Commun Studies, San Diego, CA 92110 USA; [Bond, Bradley J.] Univ Illinois, Chicago, IL 60680 USA; [Roberts, Lindsay] Univ Calif Davis, Commun, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of Arizona; University of Arizona; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Boston; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia; University of San Diego; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Aubrey, JS (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, 1103 E Univ Blvd, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",jlsa@email.arizona.edu,,"Roberts, Lindsay/0000-0001-9126-2935",,,,,43,0,0,1,4,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1077-6990,2161-430X,,J MASS COMMUN Q,Journal.

Through an online survey of 1,034 employees who had experienced an organizational planned change in the United States, results showed that organizations' frequent use of mass-mediated channels and interpersonal channels both positively influenced employees' perception of communication transparency during change, with interpersonal channels showing stronger impact than mediated channels.

Using a 3x2 experiment, we evaluate if news frames from the protest paradigm literature (riot, confrontation, and legitimizing) and the presence of an accompanying visual would make people more likely to read, like, share and comment on a news story about a street demonstration on social media. We also tested if news portrayal of protests might influence people's level of support for the movement, which in turn could lead to different types of social media engagement outcomes. Results show that only the presence of visuals has a direct impact on willingness to share a story, with frames having a limited influence on behaviour if compared to other pre-existing attitudes about the police and protesters. However, we also found that the relationship between frames and social media engagement is mediated by a change in these attitudes and increased support for the movement. These findings suggest that engagement outcomes with digital news coverage are contingent on people's support for the movement portrayed, although legitimizing coverage can influence those attitudes and shape social media behaviour in return.","[Mourao, Rachel R.] Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Kilgo, Danielle K.] Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN USA",Michigan State University; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Mourao, RR (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",mourao@msu.edu,,"Mourao, Rachel/0000-0001-8229-7247; Brown, Danielle/0000-0001-7637-8964",Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication (AEJMC) [00364152],Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication (AEJMC),"This work was supported by the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication (AEJMC), Mass Communication and Society Division (00364152).",,80,1,1,9,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

In this study, I explore how the working environment of journalists constrains opportunities for addressing gendered online violence. Through a total of 27 interviews with experts and media workers in the United Kingdom and India, I find that these structural barriers play out through three main dynamics: stratified access to support resources, workplace norms that punish reporting online violence as signs of weakness, and precarious conditions that leave journalists with little control over their work. Adverse press freedom conditions also appear to exacerbate the impact of these dynamics. Relating these findings to broader inequality regimes in the contemporary working world, I argue that online violence both reinforces and is reinforced by inequality regimes within media organizations. In the same way that organizations often fail to adequately address other forms of workplace harassment, structural barriers complicate newsroom responses to online violence.","[Claesson, Annina] CREST Inst Polytech Paris, Paris, France; [Claesson, Annina] Sci Po Medialab, Paris, France",,"Claesson, A (corresponding author), CREST Inst Polytech Paris, Paris, France.;Claesson, A (corresponding author), Sci Po Medialab, Paris, France.",annina.claesson@sciencespo.fr,,"Claesson, Annina/0000-0002-4114-2406",,,,,78,1,1,8,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

Through a process of material exploration, it explores novel configurations of technology, people and values, and in doing so, seeks to understand the implications of new designs. It is this practice of making and creating that is valuable to journalism as it grapples with how to respond to communication technologies that are increasingly subtle, physical and sensuous. In this article we examine the theory of materiality as it has been discussed in communication and design literature, proposing a conceptual approach for a design-led view of materiality in journalism studies. This view sees materiality from a form-giving perspective in which technologies and journalistic principles are materials to shape in order to explore potentials and possibilities. This article extends the concept of journalism design by examining how journalistic values can be incorporated into the design of public interest technologies. In doing so, it frames journalism as a process of designing things that respond to public concerns. The article also contributes to scholarship that sees tinkering, iteration and participation as a way to understand how news could be structurally different.","[Doherty, Skye; Johnston, Jane] Univ Queensland, Sch Commun & Arts, St Lucia, Qld, Australia; [Matthews, Ben] Univ Queensland, Sch Informat Technol & Elect Engn, St Lucia, Qld, Australia",University of Queensland; University of Queensland,"Doherty, S (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Commun & Arts, St Lucia, Qld, Australia.",s.doherty@uq.edu.au,"Doherty, Skye/C-9199-2017","Doherty, Skye/0000-0002-8189-2252",,,,,73,0,0,3,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

However, the question of how such technologies can be interwoven with newsroom practices, values, routines, and socio-cultural experiences is often neglected. This article investigates the ways in which AI-driven tools are permeating newswork and design strategies for blending technological capabilities with editorial requirements. We followed a multi-method approach to investigate the deployment of AI in news production at two London newsrooms: (1) a design ethnography at the BBC with journalists and technologists, and (2) interviews with journalists at The Times. Our findings show that while journalists are generally open to try AI-driven technologies that benefit their work, technologists struggle to integrate them into journalistic workflows. The consensus was that human judgement is required to make complex decisions in journalism and that journalistic values should be prioritised in AI tool design. We claim that AI tools need to fit with professional practices and values in journalism in order to be fully accepted as an editorial tool. Embedding new technologies into journalistic workflows requires therefore a close collaboration between journalists and technologists, and a sociotechnical design that blends in work routines and values.","[Lopez, Marisela Gutierrez] Univ Bristol, Bristol Digital Futures Inst, Bristol, Avon, England; [Porlezza, Colin] Univ Svizzera Italiana, Inst Media & Journalism, Lugano, Switzerland; [Cooper, Glenda] City Univ London, Dept Journalism, London, England; [Makri, Stephann; MacFarlane, Andrew] City Univ London, Ctr HCI Design, London, England; [Missaoui, Sondess] Univ York, Digital Creat Lab, York, N Yorkshire, England",University of Bristol; Universita della Svizzera Italiana; City University London; City University London; University of York - UK,"Lopez, MG (corresponding author), Univ Bristol, Bristol Digital Futures Inst, Bristol, Avon, England.",marisela.gutierrezlopez@bristol.ac.uk,,"Porlezza, Colin/0000-0002-1400-5879; Makri, Stephann/0000-0002-5817-4893; Gutierrez Lopez, Marisela/0000-0003-4115-1975; MacFarlane, Andrew/0000-0002-8057-0737",Google News Initiative project DMINR,Google News Initiative project DMINR,This research was funded by the Google News Initiative project DMINR.,,68,2,2,9,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

This conceptual essay, however, attempts to steer the conversation away from a technocentric emphasis on applications and instead pivot to the fundamental but overlooked issue of normativity: in this case, what should AI actually do to help fulfill journalism's broader democratic aims? Building our analysis on Rasmus Kleis Nielsen's approach that emphasizes one essential thing that journalism just might do for democracy-namely, provide accurate, accessible, diverse, relevant, and timely news about public affairs-we argue that journalistic AI could be normatively imagined and evaluated with a similar focus on simplicity and dose of democratic realism. In connection with three primary stages of newswork-information gathering, selection and production, and distribution and consumption-we explain how journalistic AI not only can work but also should work in the service of accuracy, accessibility, diversity, relevance, and timeliness. Ultimately, by placing normativity at the center of this analysis, our goal is to explore how AI might be oriented to enhance how news performs in each of these domains and thus make a pragmatic difference for journalism and democracy.","[Lin, Bibo; Lewis, Seth C.] Univ Oregon, Sch Journalism & Commun, Eugene, OR 97403 USA",University of Oregon,"Lin, BB (corresponding author), Univ Oregon, Sch Journalism & Commun, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.",bibol@uoregon.edu,,"Lin, Bibo/0000-0002-2077-9248; Lewis, Seth/0000-0001-7498-0599",,,,,115,1,1,8,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

Through in-depth interviews with ten journalists working for Korean news organizations, supplemented with an analysis of self-reflective articles, this study investigates how journalists experience this audience hostility and harassment, how they cope with it, and how their practices are influenced by it. The analysis reveals that, combined with the dualistic views of populist politics and the influence of misogynic narratives, journalists who cover topics, such as politics and gender, are more likely to become targets of anti-press violence. Moreover, it shows that anti-press violence induces negative emotions, such as discomfort, anger, lethargy, and fear, among journalists. To cope with these emotions, with little support from their news organizations, journalists tend to pursue emotion-focused coping strategies, such as striving for perfection in the newswork process, building emotional boundaries between the audience and themselves, counter-hating readers, and blaming other journalists. Finally, the paper suggests that anti-press violence in Korea promotes a chilling effect in news organizations that, consequently, may infringe on individual journalists' autonomy and editorial independence.","[Kim, Changwook] Handong Global Univ, Global Leadership Sch, Pohang, South Korea; [Shin, Wooyeol] Kyungnam Univ, Dept Media & Visual Arts, Chang Won, South Korea",Handong Global University; Kyungnam University,"Shin, W (corresponding author), Kyungnam Univ, Dept Media & Visual Arts, Chang Won, South Korea.",wooyeolshin@gmail.com,"Shin, Wooyeol/ABA-2429-2021","Shin, Wooyeol/0000-0003-3813-4103; Kim, Changwook/0000-0002-7657-2094",,,,,30,2,2,9,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

It remains an open question, however, how journalistic reactions can mitigate these effects. Based on premises of engagement moderation, accountability, and transparency in digital journalism, we conducted an online experiment investigating how critical user comments and journalistic reactions affect quality perceptions and behavioral intentions towards a news media brand. Results show that media-critical comments lower perceived brand quality, but only among media cynics, whereby increasing it among media supporters. Journalists admitting mistakes only enhances perceived brand quality for media cynics, while denying does so for everyone and decreases cynics' intention to comment negatively. Lastly, explaining why a mistake was made or not boosts brand quality perceptions overall, suggesting that transparency is a viable strategy for improving media trust in the long run.","[Prochazka, Fabian] Univ Erfurt, Dept Media & Commun Sci, Erfurt, Germany; [Obermaier, Magdalena] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Media & Commun, Munich, Germany",University of Erfurt; University of Munich,"Prochazka, F (corresponding author), Univ Erfurt, Dept Media & Commun Sci, Erfurt, Germany.",fabian.prochazka@uni-erfurt.de,,"Obermaier, Magdalena/0000-0002-3055-3744; Prochazka, Fabian/0000-0001-8678-101X",,,,,66,1,1,10,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

Eschewing one-sided, monolithic perspectives on platform dominance, we instead theorize power as relational. From this perspective, we observe important variations in news organizations' degree of platform in/dependence. Examining these variations, we propose the concept of spaces of negotiation, which refers to the opportunities available to news organizations to determine how they produce, distribute, and monetize content vis-a-vis platforms. Building on research in journalism studies, platform studies, and related disciplines, we identify three key variables that shape these spaces of negotiation: (1) platform evolution, (2) stage of production, and (3) type of news organization. A systematic analysis of these variables, we contend, allows for a more nuanced, less deterministic understanding of the role of platform companies in transforming the news landscape.","[Poell, Thomas] Univ Amsterdam, Dept Media Studies, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Nieborg, David B.] Univ Toronto, Dept Arts Culture & Media, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Duffy, Brooke Erin] Cornell Univ, Dept Commun, Ithaca, NY USA",University of Amsterdam; University of Toronto; Cornell University,"Poell, T (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Dept Media Studies, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",Poell@uva.nl,"; Duffy, Brooke/P-8567-2014","Poell, Thomas/0000-0002-3664-2588; Duffy, Brooke/0000-0001-6314-8027; Nieborg, David/0000-0002-3498-789X",,,,,80,1,1,14,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

Using boundary-work as a theoretical basis for the analyses we discovered that all the discourses in these self-referential texts expressed some degree of disruption in DDJ, especially regarding data and its ability to reshape the concept of news transparency and introduce the values and practices of hacktivism in journalism. These discourses also reinforce elements of continuity and suggest a conservative restoration of production routines, values, and conventions in journalism without changing the basic ideology of the profession. Added to highlighting the flexibility and demarcation of this profession's boundaries, this article also identifies the repertoires and identities mobilized in these processes that give Brazilian data journalism a higher profile.","[Pereira, Fabio Henrique; Mastrella, Bruna] Univ Brasilia, Brasilia, DF, Brazil",Universidade de Brasilia,"Pereira, FH (corresponding author), Univ Brasilia, Brasilia, DF, Brazil.",fabiop@unb.br,"Pereira, FÃ¡bio Henrique/A-2037-2010","Pereira, FÃ¡bio Henrique/0000-0002-2867-0167",,,,,57,0,0,3,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

Through qualitative interviews with practising journalists, the paper identifies the following four main journalistic responses to digital media criticism: consolidation (ringfencing journalistic discourse); filtering (cleaning up journalistic discourse); rationalisation (acknowledging criticism or non-responses) and counter-discourse (counteracting anti-media discourses). These responses, referred to as forms of digital discursive resistance, show that journalists are both defensive against and accommodating of risks to journalistic authority, but usually aim to reinforce and expand journalistic discourse in digital spaces.","[Cheruiyot, David] Univ Groningen, Ctr Media & Journalism Studies, Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen,"Cheruiyot, D (corresponding author), Univ Groningen, Ctr Media & Journalism Studies, Groningen, Netherlands.",d.k.cheruiyot@rug.nl,"Cheruiyot, David/O-5937-2014","Cheruiyot, David/0000-0002-4774-4643",,,,,63,1,1,5,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

One of these challenges concerns the sampling and evaluation of data using (non-validated) search terms in combination with automated content analyses. This challenge has largely been neglected by research, which is surprising, considering that noise slipping in during the process of data collection can generate great methodological concerns. To address this gap, we first offer a systematic interdisciplinary literature review, revealing that the validation of search terms is far from acknowledged as a required standard procedure, both in and beyond journalism research. Second, we assess the consequences of validating search terms, using a multi-step approach and investigating common research topics from the field of (digital) journalism research. Our findings show that careless application of non-validated search terms has its pitfalls: while scattershot search terms can make sense in initial data exploration, final inferences based on insufficiently validated search terms are at higher risk of being obscured by noise. Consequently, we provide a step-by-step recommendation for developing and validating search terms.","[Mahl, Daniela] Univ Zurich, Dept Commun & Media Res, Zurich, Switzerland; [von Nordheim, Gerret] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Commun Res, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Guenther, Lars] Univ Hamburg, Inst Journalism & Commun Studies, Hamburg, Germany; [Guenther, Lars] Stellenbosch Univ, Ctr Res Evaluat Sci & Technol, Stellenbosch, South Africa",University of Zurich; University of Amsterdam; University of Hamburg; Stellenbosch University,"Mahl, D (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Dept Commun & Media Res, Zurich, Switzerland.",d.mahl@ikmz.uzh.ch,,,"Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [IZBRZ1_186296]; German Research Foundation (DFG) as part of University of Hamburg's Cluster of Excellence Climate, Climatic Change, and Society (CLICCS) [EXC 2037]","Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); German Research Foundation (DFG) as part of University of Hamburg's Cluster of Excellence Climate, Climatic Change, and Society (CLICCS)(German Research Foundation (DFG))","Parts of this project were funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) as part of the project Science-related conspiracy theories online: Mapping their characteristics, prevalence and distribution internationally and developing contextualized counter-strategies (Grant IZBRZ1_186296) and the German Research Foundation (DFG) as part of University of Hamburg's Cluster of Excellence Climate, Climatic Change, and Society (CLICCS) (Grant EXC 2037).",,54,0,0,1,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

We suggest that by turning to alternative counter-news, audiences increase their exposure to fake news and end up being less well informed about important events. Results of a random-quota survey in Germany (N = 967) confirmed that those with higher levels of conspiracy mentality and lower media trust were more likely to use alternative counter-news. Alternative counter-news users recalled more fake news than non-users and alternative counter-news use partially mediated the relationship between counter-hegemonic attitudes and fake news recall.

However, within technically mediated systems, who is behind the mob is sometimes unclear. We therefore ask how the technical affordances of the Internet and telecommunications networks complicate the identification of attackers and their motivations and multiply the forms of retaliation that attackers level against journalists. We conducted 18 semistructured interviews with seven current or former journalists, as well as 11 professionals with experience defending news organizations, including security specialists, press freedom advocates, and newsroom infrastructure support staff. Through a constructivist grounded theory approach and in conversation with Lewis and Westlund's (2015) 4A framework, we found that journalists and those defending news organizations do not reliably identify sources and motivations behind attacks, which may be grassroots in nature but may also be instigated by corporate or government actors. Journalists nonetheless infer attribution and motivation from the context surrounding attacks. Systemic issues related to the lack of diversity, ongoing financial constraints, and journalistic norms of engagement, alongside a lack of internal and platform support, exacerbate repercussions from these attacks and harm journalism's role in a democracy.","[Henrichsen, Jennifer R.] Washington State Univ, Dept Journalism & Media Prod, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Shelton, Martin] Freedom Press Fdn, Brooklyn, NY USA",Washington State University,"Henrichsen, JR (corresponding author), Washington State Univ, Dept Journalism & Media Prod, Pullman, WA 99164 USA.",jennifer.henrichsen@wsu.edu,,"Shelton, Martin/0000-0002-6130-5823",,,,,56,2,2,5,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

While they offer great promise by making useful selections of large content pools, they raise various ethical and societal concerns due to their alleged lack of transparency, diversity and agency. Especially in the news context, this has serious implications because access to information is crucial in democratic societies. In this article we empirically explore the idea of algorithmic recommender personae as a productive socio-technical solution to these problems. We present the results from a two-phased qualitative study with Dutch and Belgian news readers (N = 27) to 1) co-design potential news recommender personae by inductively discerning core news reading motivations and relevant features, and 2) evaluate the most promising personae on their usefulness. Results highlight three distinct recommender personae (Expert, Challenger and Unwinder) that correspond with news consumers' most salient reading motivations. We conclude that, in an increasingly automated future, allowing users more control and including them when designing recommender systems is key. With this study we hope that media organizations take up the challenge towards developing human-centered and responsible algorithmic systems that serve the public good.","[Van den Bogaert, Lawrence; Geerts, David] KULeuven, Mintlab, Leuven, Belgium; [Harambam, Jaron] KULeuven, Inst Media Studies IMS, Leuven, Belgium; [Harambam, Jaron] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Athena Inst, Amsterdam, Netherlands",KU Leuven; KU Leuven; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Van den Bogaert, L (corresponding author), KULeuven, Mintlab, Leuven, Belgium.",lawrence.vdb@gmail.com,"; Harambam, Jaron/A-8527-2012","Van den Bogaert, Lawrence/0000-0002-5759-9240; Geerts, David/0000-0003-3933-9266; Harambam, Jaron/0000-0002-8286-7147",SIDN Fonds [192036],SIDN Fonds,"This research was funded by SIDN Fonds, project number 192036, titled Who would you like to be guided by?

The design of the newspaper has been a hallmark of its credibility; a newspaper looks trustworthy. But the relationship between design and trust is more complicated in a digital era. Agents of mis- and dis-information produce lake news outlets that look trustworthy, appropriating the design qualities of credible news outlets. This article brings together literature on trust in journalism, political esthetics, and pragmatist semiotics to analyze how fake news outlets seek to achieve trust. We conduct a visual analysis of both mainstream and fake news websites, identifying how fake news websites employ specific design elements in patterned ways that simultaneously (1) establish themselves as legitimate claimants to the label of news outlet and (2) differentiate themselves as outlets that can be depended upon to provide a certain class of political information that falls outside the mainstream. We argue that the news website is best understood as a design genre, within which there can be variations in design style. Fake news outlets must conform to the genre expectations of news websites. Beyond this, fake news websites must also employ design elements in ways that convey political ideology through style.","[Billard, Thomas J.] Northwestern Univ, Sch Commun, Evanston, IL 60201 USA; [Billard, Thomas J.] Ctr Appl Transgender Studies, Chicago, IL 60657 USA; [Moran, Rachel E.] Univ Washington, Ctr Informed Publ, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",Northwestern University; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Billard, TJ (corresponding author), Northwestern Univ, Sch Commun, Evanston, IL 60201 USA.;Billard, TJ (corresponding author), Ctr Appl Transgender Studies, Chicago, IL 60657 USA.",billard@northwestern.edu,"Billard, Thomas/J-7508-2019","Billard, Thomas/0000-0003-0641-9278",,,,,43,0,0,5,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

Three themes emerge: raison d'etre and purpose, tensions between democratic and authoritarian norms, and the establishment of legitimacy through an emphasis on journalistic practices, revealing that engaged journalists are driven by media criticism, but still position themselves within journalism, offering a radical new path.

In multidimensional scaling models, we inspect how the media outlets relate to each other. The results show two types of RAM that deviate from the mainstream in different ways. The first type is clearly distinguishable by its interpretive style and heavy use of alternative frames. Media of this type openly oppose immigration, the German government and mainstream media. The second type, consisting of international news providers like RT, exhibits a more descriptive style and frame repertories that are similar to conservative mainstream media.

Results show survey respondents were motivated to read the digital-native sites because of their alternative characteristics, such as media participation in the community, taking a stance against injustice, and their independence. Similarly, focus group findings indicated journalists distinguish themselves from mainstream media because of their innovative approaches to journalism, their independence, their participation in communities, and the stances they take. Ultimately, this study suggests that this trend of independent, online-native news sites does not fit neatly into alternative or mainstream categorizations.

For one thing, media outlets offering journalistic content no longer compete just with each other but also with all sorts of content from various sources, such as corporate publishers. This particularly applies to the information space provided by Google and other search engines. This leads to the question of how traditional media brands prevail in this information space: do traditional media brands have a competitive advantage because users perceive their journalistic content as more valuable in terms of credibility and reputation? Accordingly, this study investigates competition and user selection on Google. Drawing on a representative, experimental selection study of the German-speaking Swiss population (N = 1,100), search engine selection behavior was investigated. Results show that selection preferences do not differ between traditional media brands and other competitors, such as corporate publishers. This poses a major challenge for media brands. However, credibility and reputation significantly influence selection preferences.

In this article, I observe that the current literature on news recommenders and news diversity largely draws on a narrow set of theories of liberal and deliberative democracy. Another strand of democratic theory often referred to as 'agonism' is often ignored. This, I argue, is a mistake. Liberal and deliberative theories of democracy focus on the question of how political disagreements and conflicts can be resolved in a rational and legitimate manner. Agonism, to the contrary, stresses the ineradicability of conflict and the need to make conflict productive. This difference in thinking about the purpose of democratic politics can also lead to new ways of thinking about the value of news diversity and role algorithmic news recommenders should play in promoting it.

Data was perceived of as a type of capital that could engender, amongst other things, increased knowledge about the internal workings of the organization, thus making it easier to audit its activities, and to standardize the practice of news-valuation throughout SR.

Then, we analyze which folk theories journalists create during their use of algorithm-driven tools. Results show that algorithmic tools specifically designed for the journalistic research process are rarely or not at all used. Yet, more crucially, search engines and social media, that are driven by algorithms, play a major role when it comes to the search, selection, and verification of sources and information. However, journalists are not aware of this hidden research assistant facilitating their research process. When explicitly asked, they profess specific notions regarding the use of algorithmic-driven tools in the form of folk theories, which are predominantly negative regarding the influence of AI on journalism.

Specifically, they may enable citizens to access a diversity of viewpoints concerning matters of public interest via digital means (public service recommender systems). On the basis of Article 10 ECHR, States are arguably required to guarantee such online access diversity. At the same time, they must, pursuant to that same provision, at all times ensure that individuals maintain autonomy and freedom of choice as regards whether or not to consume certain content. In that context, this contribution argues that policymakers may consider nudging people toward reading diversely through recommendation (libertarian-paternalistic approach). Additionally, it points to the possibility of merely offering users the tools to do so, thereby allowing them to make an (informed) choice as regards whether to use them or not (libertarian approach). The first approach presumably best mitigates chances of selective exposure, whilst the second is more liberty-preserving.

Do they utilise their independence to display actors that are underrepresented in the mainstream news? And does it affect the actor diversity in their news coverage and the journalistic environment as a whole? This study scrutinises the differences in actor diversity and actor presentation in articles published by alternative and mainstream news media to gauge if alternative media are more one-sided and if they contribute to the external actor diversity of the news environment. We analyse a sample of news articles on migration and social affairs published by two mainstream media and four alternative outlets. Despite limited differences in article-level actor diversity between alternative and mainstream news media, our findings highlight that right-wing and left-wing alternative media exploit their editorial independence differently to highlight other actor categories. Left-wing alternative news media present more civil society actors, while right-wing alternative news outlets pay more attention to right-wing politicians and parties. Thus, alternative news media are not that different in terms of internal actor diversity, but they modestly advance the external actor diversity in the news environment.","[Buyens, Willem; Van Aelst, Peter] Univ Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium",University of Antwerp,"Buyens, W (corresponding author), Univ Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium.",willem.buyens@uantwerpen.be,"van aelst, peter/E-2285-2019","van aelst, peter/0000-0002-2548-0309",Research Foundation -Flanders (FWO) [S008817N],Research Foundation -Flanders (FWO)(FWO),This research was supported by Research Foundation -Flanders (FWO) under Grant S008817N.,,52,3,3,7,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

Memes recurrently serve as identificatory markers of affiliation across social media platforms, with ensuing controversies potentially proving newsworthy. Our elaboration of weaponization refers to the purposeful deployment of memetic imagery to disrupt, undermine, attack, resist or reappropriate discursive positions pertaining to public affairs issues in the news. For alt-right memetic conflicts, impetuses range from sharing a joke to promoting alternative facts, rebuking political correctness or wokeness, defending preferred framings of free speech, or signalling cynicism, distrust or dissent with mainstream media, amongst other drivers. Of particular import, we argue, is the politics of othering at stake, including in the wider journalistic mediation of a meme's public significance. Rendering problematic this contested process, this article focuses on Pepe the Frog as an exemplar, showing how and why variations of this mimetic cartoon have been selectively mobilized to help normalize - ostensibly through humour, parody or satire - rules of inclusion and exclusion consistent with hate-led agendas. Digital journalism, we conclude, must improve its capacity to identify and critique mimetic weaponization so as to avoid complicity in perpetuating visceral forms of prejudice and discrimination so often presented as just a bit of fun.","[Peters, Chris] Roskilde Univ, Dept Commun & Arts, Roskilde, Denmark; [Allan, Stuart] Cardiff Univ, Sch Journalism Media & Culture, Cardiff, Wales",Roskilde University; Cardiff University,"Peters, C (corresponding author), Roskilde Univ, Dept Commun & Arts, Roskilde, Denmark.",cpeters@ruc.dk,,"Peters, Chris/0000-0002-5813-1674",,,,,50,8,8,11,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

As digital and freelance journalists are excluded from legal journalism definitions, outdated regulations divide professional journalists into a hierarchical system. Rigid boundaries and blurred practice exist side by side. Power imbalances, media patrimonialism, and an ambivalent professional association divide the journalists' community over recognition and benefits. A qualitative media analysis of three newspapers and interviews revealed a contested spectrum. Journalists demanded professional autonomy but did not push for boundary expansion. Radical critique was missing. Beyond the regional focus, this article offers a contextualized analysis of how severe exclusion and power imbalances shape journalism boundaries. It brings journalists themselves, not just politics, as a force into the foreground to be reckoned with as journalistic divisions block change and sustain inequalities.","[Badr, Hanan] Cairo Univ, Fac Mass Commun, Journalism Dept, Giza, Egypt; [Badr, Hanan] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Media & Commun Studies, Berlin, Germany",Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Cairo University; Free University of Berlin,"Badr, H (corresponding author), Cairo Univ, Fac Mass Commun, Journalism Dept, Giza, Egypt.",hanan.badr@fu-berlin.de,,,,,,,48,5,5,1,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

Sixty-eight participants received a three-week newspaper trial subscription and were interviewed about their experiences afterward. Facilitators of repeated use were concurrent rewards; embedment into existing routines; and visual reminders. Obstacles were lack of steady routines; strong existing habits; perceived effort; disillusionment; and accessibility. Findings point to the importance of visibility: participants - even those with positive initial experiences - tended to forget their subscription. Visual cues were needed to remind participants to read their subscription: app icons, open browser tabs, social media posts, push notifications, and the print newspaper. Proactive implementation of these cues suggests participants themselves were also aware of their propensity to forget the subscription. Existing (news) habits either helped anchor use of the subscription or blocked it by being automatically cued up by context features. Results also point to a mental hurdle: having to muster up the cognitive and motivational energy to start reading the news. Finally, findings suggest that concurrently experienced rewards may be more conducive to news habit formation than retrospectively experienced rewards.","[Kormelink, Tim Groot] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Language Literature & Commun, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Kormelink, TG (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Language Literature & Commun, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",t.grootkormelink@vu.nl,,,,,,,54,0,0,1,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

Using a corpus of hundreds of thousands of headline A/B tests run by hundreds of news publishers, we develop and evaluate a machine-learned model to predict headline testing outcomes. We find that the model exhibits modest performance above baseline and further estimate an empirical upper bound for such content-based prediction in this domain, indicating an important role for non-content-based factors in test outcomes.

We expect this could lead to diverging contributions to overall news diversity. We assess how mainstream-like, partisan and activist media differ from mainstream reporting concerning migration and refugee policy in Germany. We combine a manual analysis of speaker diversity in 12 mainstream and alternative outlets (N = 1,172 articles) with a computational topic model (N = 34,819 articles) covering 30 outlets to assess topic diversity. Interestingly, we find no significant differences between mainstream and alternative outlets regarding overall speaker diversity. But our data show differences in which parties get cited, and whether outlets focus on experts, civil society speakers, or migrants themselves. While mainstream media offer higher overall topic diversity, alternative media split along the lines of agenda accommodation and more independent agendas of partisan and activist media.","[Freudenthaler, Rainer; Wessler, Hartmut] Univ Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany",University of Mannheim,"Freudenthaler, R (corresponding author), Univ Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany.",rfreuden@mail.uni-mannheim.de,,"Freudenthaler, Rainer/0000-0002-9075-1232",,,,,60,0,0,5,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

Results reveal that news hedging was more predictive of perceived credibility, news sharing, and fact-checking tendencies than was comment incivility. Hedged reporting was also found to elevate perceived news credibility, which in turn predicted a greater likelihood of news sharing. Moreover, perceived credibility increased fact-checking tendency only when the news was reported with hedged messages.

Previous research indicates that users of social media primarily share information that contains attention-grabbing elements. Because sensationalist elements are prevalent in disinformation, this study examines the role of sensationalism in supporting disinformation. We conducted survey experiments in six countries (N = 7,009), presenting versions of a false claim that differed in their degree of sensationalism. We varied three contextual conditions for disinformation support: whether respondents grew up in a tabloid-oriented national news culture, whether they indicated individual usage preferences for tabloid and alternative media, and how they rated their situational uncertainty during the pandemic. Our results show a weak influence of tabloidized cultures, but people who frequently use tabloid or alternative media are more likely to agree with disinformation. Users who are uncertain about what is true and what is false are also more likely to agree with disinformation, especially when it is presented sensationally. The average user, however, is more likely to agree with disinformation that is presented neutrally. This finding is concerning, as disinformation presented in a sober manner is much harder to detect by those who want to fight the infodemic.","[Staender, Anna; Humprecht, Edda; Esser, Frank] Univ Zurich, Dept Commun & Media Res, Zurich, Switzerland; [Morosoli, Sophie; Van Aelst, Peter] Univ Antwerp, Dept Polit Sci, Antwerp, Belgium",University of Zurich; University of Antwerp,"Staender, A (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Dept Commun & Media Res, Zurich, Switzerland.",a.staender@ikmz.uzh.ch,"; van aelst, peter/E-2285-2019","Staender, Anna/0000-0002-7462-1278; van aelst, peter/0000-0002-2548-0309; Esser, Frank/0000-0002-1627-1521; Morosoli, Sophie/0000-0002-4651-3819",Swiss National Science Foundation; Research Foundation -Flanders [100017L_182253],Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission); Research Foundation -Flanders(FWO),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study is part of a project funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation and the Research Foundation -Flanders (Grant No. 100017L_182253).",,84,3,3,5,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

Based on a manual content analysis of 14.690 user comments on nine German news websites, we find that comments with a higher argument strength are more likely to receive disagreement in general and reasoned disagreement in particular. Further, the levels of (reasoned) disagreement are higher on platforms with strong discussion norms and supporting technical features.

The study found divergent disclosure practices across websites, between language and visual disclosures, and between native ad links on the homepage and native ad posts on story pages within a website. Overall, older organizations with more Pulitzer awards and younger organizations with relatively more Pulitzer awards and social media followers seemed to execute clearer disclosure. Moreover, the organizations with more Pulitzer awards seemed to impose a clearer disclosure language on native ad links at gateway locations than those with fewer awards but lessened disclosure of native ad posts on the landing pages. The older news websites with more social media followers adopted an obscurer disclosure language of native ad links but distinguished native ad posts more once audiences landed on the content page.

Based on 32 semi-structured interviews with local journalists from 20 media organizations across four large cities in China, our study investigates how journalists navigate multiple social media platforms and employ data-driven sourcing as complements to traditional sourcing practices. We find the disruptions caused by the pandemic have unexpectedly converged with the ongoing developments of platformisation and digital transformation in China. We also reveal the subtlety of the field's refractions of external shocks and structural constraints, as evidenced in journalists' sourcing practices amid the crisis. Variations in their navigation of multiple sourcing options, i.e., platform-swinging, giving voice to the data or the lingering effect of hysteresis, are identified as contingent on media type and locality, platform affordance and popularity, as well as practical sensibilities towards each sourcing option at their disposal. Expanding the wide-ranging field theory to China's specific social and political contexts, this study offers a valuable window to discern technology-induced changes and the field's refraction effect to external influences.","[Zhang, Shuling] Univ Int Business & Econ UIBE, Sch Int Studies, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Qiong] Wuhan Univ, Sch Journalism & Commun, Wuhan, Peoples R China",University of International Business & Economics; Wuhan University,"Zhang, SL (corresponding author), Univ Int Business & Econ UIBE, Sch Int Studies, Beijing, Peoples R China.",adazsl@126.com,,"Zhang, Shuling/0000-0002-3553-7276",MOE (Ministry of Education in China) Project of Humanities and Social Sciences [19YJA860023]; program for Young Excellent Talents at the University of International Business Economics,MOE (Ministry of Education in China) Project of Humanities and Social Sciences; program for Young Excellent Talents at the University of International Business Economics,This research was supported by a grant from MOE (Ministry of Education in China) Project of Humanities and Social Sciences (Project No.19YJA860023) and a program for Young Excellent Talents at the University of International Business & Economics.,,33,3,3,10,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

Covering these conspiracy theories presents difficult editorial choices for news organizations. This article examines how diverse news outlets chose to report on one key COVID-19 conspiracy theory: the (entirely unfounded) claim that 5G telecommunications technology severely worsened or even caused the pandemic. We draw on online article data from the global news database GDELT to examine the coverage of COVID/5G conspiracy theories: we trace the changing nature of conspiracist claims; chart the expansion of coverage from fringe media to respected mainstream outlets; and pay particular attention to key stories that significantly increase the reach of reporting about this conspiracy theory. Arising from this analysis are new questions for journalists: what role does their coverage of such conspiracy theories play in amplifying them? Are there newsbeats that are particularly vulnerable to problematic information?

But many studies do not take into account audience expectations of fact-checking or their engagement with news generally in the context of a national media system or its political culture. Our study makes an intervention into debates about fact-checking by focussing on the effectiveness this type of journalism has with audiences who were attentive to the news in the UK's media system during a key point in a major health crisis. Drawing on a six-week news diary study (N = 200) during the coronavirus pandemic, our study concluded that the UK's impartial media ecology and public service ethos creates an environment where audiences are largely receptive to journalists' fact-checking and countering misinformation. Yet our content analysis of television news (N = 1259) during the pandemic found most broadcasters did not regularly challenge or question the government's decision-making. We argue that since audiences favoured robust forms of journalistic scrutiny, broadcasters could more prominently fact-check claims and question dubious statements without undermining trust in journalism.

However, current literature offers limited insight into how these technologies reconcile with the shared ideological norms and beliefs of journalists. This article identifies recurring tensions between journalism's ideology and increasing commercial pressures in existing literature focusing on illustrative examples of digital technology implementations in journalism, and discusses how personalised news recommendation may recreate or mediate these tensions. The findings suggest that personalised news recommendation can facilitate journalism in service of the public by using value-sensitive algorithmic design that incorporates editorial input and nudges users to view diverse and serendipitous content. The findings additionally emphasise the importance of algorithmic transparency as a constituent element to distinguish nudging that prompts reflective behaviour from manipulation of choice, thus mediating tensions with journalism's ideological aspirations to be fair and objective. Lastly, the paper calls for a higher level of understanding and interaction between journalists and algorithmic designers to mediate the impact on journalistic autonomy and ease the inherent transfer of editorial authority over distribution.","[Moller, Lynge Asbjorn] Aarhus Univ, Dept Media & Journalism Studies, Aarhus, Denmark; [Moller, Lynge Asbjorn] Danish Sch Media & Journalism, Aarhus, Denmark",Aarhus University,"Moller, LA (corresponding author), Aarhus Univ, Dept Media & Journalism Studies, Aarhus, Denmark.;Moller, LA (corresponding author), Danish Sch Media & Journalism, Aarhus, Denmark.",lyngemoller@cc.au.dk,,"Moller, Lynge Asbjorn/0000-0002-1632-2253",,,,,85,2,2,9,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

Guided by this general definition, and to better accommodate new institutional forms of journalism specifically in the hybrid media system, I introduce a typology based on two dimensions: level-of-analysis and structural emphasis, that is whether on traditional news organizations or emerging assemblages. In balancing their roles as critic and champion, I argue that academic observers must not take institutional stability, coherence, and value for granted, which previous perspectives have over-stated, but rather take a more explicitly normative assessment of how different structures contribute to those qualities.","[Reese, Stephen D.] Univ Texas Austin, Moody Coll Commun, Sch Journalism & Media, Journalism, Austin, TX 78712 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Reese, SD (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, Moody Coll Commun, Sch Journalism & Media, Journalism, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",Steve.reese@utexas.edu,,,,,,,58,5,5,7,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

Arguably, this trend is most pervasive in India, where online supporters of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) troll and abuse journalists critical of the Narendra Modi government. Over the years, the BJP has harnessed the digital work of these online Hindu nationalists for agenda setting, spreading their political ideology, and influencing public discourse. Such a symbiotic relationship between the mob and the state has put to question the argument distinguishing mob censorship and state censorship of the press. Through a qualitative textual analysis of tweets posted by online Hindu nationalists, this article explores the discursive strategies employed by right-wing activists to influence the BJP government in its censorship of the press. This study finds that through tactics such as calls to 'cancel' journalists, intimidation of foreign correspondents, and digital surveillance of news reporters, online Hindu nationalists aid the BJP government in the suppression of dissident reporting in India.","[Bhat, Prashanth] Univ Houston, Jack J Valenti Sch Commun, Houston, TX 77004 USA; [Chadha, Kalyani] Northwestern Univ, Medill Sch Journalism, Evanston, IL USA",University of Houston System; University of Houston; Northwestern University,"Bhat, P (corresponding author), Univ Houston, Jack J Valenti Sch Commun, Houston, TX 77004 USA.",nrbhat2@central.uh.edu,,,,,,,67,0,0,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

Through these negative emotions, each group of people is represented as a scapegoat for the distress of ordinary people.

These are: (i) the consolidation of a digital leak journalism culture, (ii) an increasingly ferocious form of digital guerrilla journalism, and (iii) the rise in popularity, of small digital-based news platforms that, arguably, are increasingly eclipsing already established mainstream (digital) news platforms as sources of news. These practices' nascent roots have their genesis in the early 2000 period. In the post-coup context, they have assumed a new and wider meaning, and have become part of the mainstream. This solidification of digital journalism practices has consequently enabled journalists to speak back to power by providing robust forms of investigative journalism, and simultaneously avoiding being 'swallowed' by the state. While we admit to various gradations of digital journalism practices before the coup, we use the coup as our point of departure in order to factor in the incrementally disruptive and repressive political environment that has forced journalists to adopt digital journalism practices more than in any period of the country's history.","[Munoriyarwa, Allen] Univ Johannesburg, Dept Media & Commun, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Chibuwe, Albert] Univ Free State, Unit Inst Change & Social Justice, Bloemfontein, South Africa",University of Johannesburg; University of the Free State,"Munoriyarwa, A (corresponding author), Univ Johannesburg, Dept Media & Commun, Johannesburg, South Africa.",allenm@uj.ac.za,"Munoriyarwa, Allen/AED-7461-2022","Munoriyarwa, Allen/0000-0001-5064-3192",,,,,55,5,5,1,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

Under Rodrigo Duterte's presidency, his administration and supporters targeted independent journalism using violent tactics online and offline, including threats of rape, death, and doxing. Yet, when online mobs harass reporters it is not simply an extension of state censorship. Rather, understanding the dynamics that spur regular social media users to take part in anti-press mobs requires a less hierarchical approach. Nor can we simply blame technology for facilitating mob censorship. We argue that crowds are formed from the bottom up, are loosely organized, and intensely felt. These crowds do not necessarily share goals or identities despite their collective affect and aesthetics. Instead, more sustained types of subjectivity emerge from involvement in the crowd. Ultimately, journalism studies can benefit from the insights of crowd theory that emphasize the plasticity of the subject and the ways in which ideas and feelings spread in rapid and unpredictable ways online.","[Neilson, Tai; Ortiga, Kara] Macquarie Univ, Fac Arts Humanities, Media Studies, Sydney, NSW, Australia",Macquarie University,"Ortiga, K (corresponding author), Macquarie Univ, Fac Arts Humanities, Media Studies, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",kasmira.ortiga@mq.edu.au,,"Neilson, Tai/0000-0002-5109-5850",,,,,59,0,0,5,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

This practice, termed here the military-as-alibi strategy, is highly consequential. First, it excludes Israeli citizens who are exempt from military service (mostly Palestinian citizens of Israel and ultra-orthodox Jews). Second, it affirms the presumption that good journalists are not to be measured by their reporting, but rather by external loyalty tests that allegedly demonstrate their commitment to the national cause. Drawing on analyses of interviews with 20 Israeli journalists, media coverage and social media content, this article frames the military-as-alibi strategy within the local context of a militarised society, but also as part of journalists' global struggle to win the hearts of their audiences in challenging times. Building on Tuchman (1972), the article labels journalists' references to their military backgrounds as a strategic ritual of loyalty. The article proposes an alternative strategy to counter anti-press attacks: if journalism is indeed a public good (Pickard 2019), then good journalism should be considered good citizenship. This approach could free journalists from surrendering to nationalist loyalty tests, and lay better foundations for journalists-audiences relationships in the future.","[Panievsky, Ayala] Univ Cambridge, Dept Sociol, Cambridge, England",University of Cambridge,"Panievsky, A (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Sociol, Cambridge, England.",Ap2034@cam.ac.uk,,,Gates Cambridge Trust,Gates Cambridge Trust,Gates Cambridge Trust.,,56,0,0,3,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

This study locates Journalism of Things in existing theory and elaborates on innovation practices with the analytical lenses of boundary work and objects of journalism. Three case studies on recent award-winning journalism projects in Germany include interviews, media content analyses, and observations. The findings suggest four typical phases in JoT projects: formation, data work, presentation, and ramification. Blurred boundaries of journalism towards science and activism become apparent when co-creative JoT teams apply scientific methods and technology design while mobilizing communities. The article discusses how things (or objects) of JoT have implications on the configuration for collaborative arrangements and audience relations. By creating and disseminating new local knowledge on matters of common concern, JoT is contributing to empowering both journalism and citizens.","[Hamm, Andrea] Tech Univ Berlin, Fac Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Weizenbaum Inst Networked Soc, Berlin, Germany",Technical University of Berlin,"Hamm, A (corresponding author), Tech Univ Berlin, Fac Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Weizenbaum Inst Networked Soc, Berlin, Germany.",andrea.hamm@tu-berlin.de,,,Federal Ministry of Education and Research of Germany (BMBF) [16DII124],Federal Ministry of Education and Research of Germany (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),This work has been supported by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research of Germany (BMBF) under grant no. 16DII124 (Deutsches Internet-Institut).,,55,0,0,1,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

We argue that these agencies serve as discursive propagators because their outreach is widespread throughout the media ecosystem and are regarded as one of the only official sources of news on the protest movements in these respective countries. This article makes two main original contributions to the field of digital journalism. First, it introduces the theoretical concept of discursive propagators that addresses the often neglected information impact of state-run news agencies operating in authoritarian states and their influence on other news media. By examining this seldom studied area of news production in the region, we are able to glean some news content that has the potential of influencing Arabic news media. Second, the study examines a unique Arabic language dataset and analyzes it using topic modelling and other digital approaches that are not often employed in the analysis of Arabic news. The analysis of digital state news agency coverage is contextualized to provide more insight into this digital type of content that often sets the tone of local journalistic production about the Arab Spring and other politically sensitive issues.","[Al-Rawi, Ahmed; Iskandar, Adel] Simon Fraser Univ, Sch Commun, Fac Commun Art & Technol, Burnaby, BC, Canada",Simon Fraser University,"Al-Rawi, A (corresponding author), Simon Fraser Univ, Sch Commun, Fac Commun Art & Technol, Burnaby, BC, Canada.",aalrawi@sfu.ca,,"Al-Rawi, Ahmed/0000-0001-7336-1550",,,,,72,2,2,5,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

However, existing empirical assessments on the share of news avoiders rely exclusively on survey data and the results vary drastically between studies, making it difficult to evaluate the severity of the issue. This study relies on tracking data of Swiss Internet users and applies and discusses two computational methods, identifying news at the domain and article level, to realistically assess the extent of non-users of online news. Results indicate that at least 14.2% of Internet users do not use news online. Furthermore, this study suggests that identifying news use solely based on tracking data at the domain level is distorted by a faux news effect, i.e., non-news use on news domains, and an invisible news effect, i.e., news use on small and unknown news domains. The parallel use of tracking data and supervised text classification allows to dissect and discuss these effects systematically. Similarly, it is found that not accounting for news use via apps overestimates the extent of non-use of online news. The findings provide valuable insights for future applications of these methods in similar contexts.","[Reiss, Michael, V] Univ Zurich, Dept Commun & Media Res, Zurich, Switzerland",University of Zurich,"Reiss, MV (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Dept Commun & Media Res, Zurich, Switzerland.",m.reiss@ilcmz.uzh.ch,,,Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Forderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) [176443],Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Forderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)); Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),This work was funded by Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur F_orderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung.This research project received funding from the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF Grant No. 176443).,,84,0,0,6,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

It also explores how the interplay of the platform's owner, Tencent's commercial logics and the technology company's relations with the state may have shaped WeChat's news sharing through the lens of the political economy of communication.

Scholars have found that journalists have turned social media platforms into essential components of their professional operations. However, the extent to which journalists engage in debunking misinformation on sodas media is still unclear. By conducting a U.S. Nationally representative survey with more than 400 journalists, this study delves into journalists' perceptions of false information, social media use, and debunking actions to expose misleading content in online contexts. Our findings indicate low levels of debunking, although we found factors associated with journalists either confronting or reporting misinformation. On the one hand, journalists who use social media platforms to develop their brands and engage directly with their audiences are more likely to publicly confront misinformation. On the other hand, journalists who believe social media companies should be held accountable for the spread of fake news do not engage directly in confronting false information, but do report it when they encounter it. Taken together, our findings suggest the journalist-audience relationship plays a central role to understand debunking behaviors in online spaces.","[Saldana, Magdalena] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Comunicac, Santiago, Chile; [Saldana, Magdalena] Millennium Inst Fdn Res Data IMFD, Santiago, Chile; [Vu, Hong Tien] Univ Kansas, William Allen White Sch Journalism & Mass Commun, Lawrence, KS USA",Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile; University of Kansas,"Saldana, M (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Comunicac, Santiago, Chile.;Saldana, M (corresponding author), Millennium Inst Fdn Res Data IMFD, Santiago, Chile.",magdalena.saldana@uc.cl,"SaldaÃ±a, Magdalena/ABD-4714-2021","SaldaÃ±a, Magdalena/0000-0002-1218-0091",,,,,74,2,2,6,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

We used a three-wave panel survey of Americans (n = 730) and analyses of local news posted on Facebook (n = 2,632) at three points during the early pandemic to illustrate how the crisis coverage gap operates. Findings demonstrate a clear divide between the news the public wanted about the pandemic and what local media delivered on Facebook. Specifically, the media over-delivered economic and business news relative to public interest. It left the public wanting for news about how grocery stores were responding to the pandemic and for fact cheques ascertaining the truthfulness of information about the crisis.

It argues that current usage of ANT within digital journalism studies tends to centre on the symmetry principle, or the idea that humans and nonhumans may be actors in an actor-network. In a review of the broader theory, the essay shows that the symmetry principle is one tool among others that may benefit the study of digital journalism. It then suggests that ANT's non-spatial understanding of society may be especially helpful. ANT's conception of social space has four principal advantages. It imagines news production as a series of news assemblages rather than a unified profession; it allows that not every actor in a news assemblage is a journalist; it does not equate proximity with meaning; and, it encourages assessment of the relative strength of a news assemblage in terms of recruitment and dissemination rather than cohesion and agreement. The essay concludes with a brief discussion of common criticisms of ANT.","[Ryfe, David] Univ Iowam, Sch Journalism & Mass Commun, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA",,"Ryfe, D (corresponding author), Univ Iowam, Sch Journalism & Mass Commun, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.",david-ryfe@uiowa.edu,,,,,,,76,4,4,10,41,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

I argue that the introduction of Al in the news risks shifting even more control to and increasing the news industry's dependence on platform companies. While platform companies' power over news organisations has to date mainly flown from their control over the channels of distribution, Al potentially allows them to extend this control to the means of production as the technology increasingly permeates all stages of the news-making process. As a result, news organisations risk becoming even more tethered to platform companies in the long-run, potentially limiting their autonomy and, by extension, contributing to a restructuring of the public arena as news organisations are re-shaped according to the logics of platform businesses.

In particular, the researchers attempted to clarify the concept of news tailoring by identifying its structures in the context of digital news consumption. The study's findings show that news tailoring takes place either through excluding (decreasing the quantity of news to process) or including (lowering the complexity involved in news processing) specific types of news. Specifically, two excluding behaviors (ignoring and filtering) and two including behaviors (customizing and saving) constitute the dimension of news tailoring. The results demonstrate that those who suffer from higher levels of news overload are more likely to adopt two types of exclusionary approaches (ignoring and filtering) and a saving strategy. However, news overload and news customizing were not significantly associated.

In an increasingly fragmented media and audience landscape, it has become more important to consider how social identity shapes audience expectations. However, scholarship has tended to examine expectations based on single identity categories (e.g., class or gender), revealing a crucial but disassembled understanding of how audiences perceive the journalism they consume. This study relies on an intersectional framework and eight focus groups to examine how class, race, and gender, as intersecting and mutually constitutive modes of power/oppression, shape audiences' expectations of journalism in South Africa. It identifies intersectional differences in audiences' expectations of solutions journalism, perceptions of journalism's unaffordability and inaccessibility, and normative evaluations of quality and popular journalism that reveal classist and racist discourses of distinction and stereotyping.

Working on the basis that sharers do not know whether the news is fake, we propose the term dubious news to help answer that question. The term describes news which exists in two states simultaneously, both true and false until it has been established which it is. People who would be reluctant to knowingly share fake news might nonetheless share dubious news. Focus groups run in Singapore during the early stages of the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic - when uncertainty ran high - explored why people share dubious news, its value in establishing truth, and its impact on group cohesion. We identify a difference between the motivation of the sharer and how that motivation is perceived by a recipient, which further illustrates the distinction between dubious and fake news.

China is experiencing a platformization of society akin to what has occurred in the West.

We explore a particularly key player-Jinri Toutiao, led by ByteDance (parent company of the popular app TikTok)-as a case that exemplifies the platform logic in China's news ecosystem and how it involves a delicate dance with the public and regulators in a politically restrictive environment. We find that the mutual shaping of platforms and society is not a given but rather a dynamic process. Indeed, we show that Toutiao's tremendous success is partially because of the state's laissez-faire policy in the earlier years, and that its move to assume greater social responsibility is a response to recent tightening of regulations.

First, in a quasi-experimental design, we asked a diverse set of participants (N=78) to search Google News using four search terms and report the first five articles recommended for each term. We found little evidence of news personalisation, which challenges the claim that news search algorithms contribute to weakened viewpoint diversity. We also found a high degree of homogeneity in news search results, with legacy media brands dominating. Second, we conducted a manual content analysis of the articles recommended by Google News for our search terms (N=192), focusing on favourability towards each term. We found that while there was little relationship between the favourability slant of the articles and political leanings of participants, there were two exceptions: self-identified right-wing participants were more likely to see unfavourable stories about 1) immigration, and 2) a left-wing politician. This reopens the question of news search engines' contributions to polarisation and viewpoint diversity for certain news consumers.","[Evans, Ryan; Jackson, Daniel; Murphy, Jaron] Bournemouth Univ, Fac Media & Commun, Poole, Dorset, England",Bournemouth University,"Jackson, D (corresponding author), Bournemouth Univ, Fac Media & Commun, Poole, Dorset, England.",jacksond@bournemouth.ac.uk,,"Jackson, Daniel/0000-0002-8833-9476; Murphy, Dr Jaron/0000-0002-4123-364X",,,,,47,0,0,15,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

In journalistic contexts, with relative ease, this data can provide detailed documentation about events - connecting people, actions, and settings - in unprecedented thoroughness and complexity, even without informed consent. Locative data also can create significant threats to personal privacy, legal due process, and ethical norms along the way. To determine how journalists, conceptualize the emergence and power of locative data, this research turns to organizational codes of ethics, as representative of public discourse in the field. This content analysis explored such discourse in more than 50 major U.S. news organizations, including examinations of public policies and terms of service. This analysis shows that fewer than half of the largest U.S. news organizations even publicly share a code of ethics, conveying transparency and leadership issues throughout the field. The implications of this research also highlight the lack of clear policies and guidelines for how such data should be handled, protected, and ethically used by journalists.","[Oppegaard, Brett] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Sch Commun, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Weiss, Amy Schmitz] San Diego State Univ, Coll Profess Studies & Fine Arts, Sch Journalism & Media Studies, San Diego, CA 92182 USA",University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; California State University System; San Diego State University,"Oppegaard, B (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, Sch Commun, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",brett.oppegaard@hawaii.edu,"Oppegaard, Brett/GVT-2800-2022; Oppegaard, Brett/J-1653-2015","Oppegaard, Brett/0000-0002-5778-1464",,,,,66,2,2,1,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

Using the question of which news article characteristics predict news engagement on social media, this illustration of the multiverse approach shows how different measurement, data processing, and modelling choices lead to divergent conclusions. In particular, we show how the selection of widely used automated text analysis tools and preprocessing steps influence the conclusions drawn from the analysis. We also use this illustration to guide interested scholars through the different steps of doing a multiverse analysis. More broadly, we demonstrate how multiverse analysis can be an open and transparent research approach in a field that is increasingly faced with a wide range of analytical choices.","[Pipal, Christian] Univ Amsterdam, Dept Polit Sci, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Song, Hyunjin] Yonsei Univ, Dept Commun, Seoul, South Korea; [Boomgaarden, Hajo G.] Univ Vienna, Dept Commun, Vienna, Austria",University of Amsterdam; Yonsei University; University of Vienna,"Pipal, C (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Dept Polit Sci, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",c.pipal@uva.nl,"Song, Hyunjin/ABD-2100-2020; Pipal, Christian/ABY-0629-2022","Song, Hyunjin/0000-0001-7752-3035; Pipal, Christian/0000-0002-5395-2035; Boomgaarden, Hajo G./0000-0002-5260-1284",European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [759079],European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme(European Research Council (ERC)),"unding Christian Pipal received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 759079, POLEMIC.",,66,1,1,3,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

Partnerships among news outlets, and between journalists and civil-society groups, have been heralded as ways to leverage digital tools and technologies to produce in-depth, impactful reporting in the face of economic and professional challenges besetting the news industry. While collaboration is widely seen as a way to do more with less, few studies have focused on the mechanisms that allow successful collaborations to overcome competitive friction, particularly at the local level, where resources are most constrained and economic pressures most intense. We used qualitative case-study research, including in-depth interviews (N = 29) with leaders and participants involved with collaborations in three European countries, to examine the ways they minimize competitive friction through their approaches to developing reporting projects, coordinating activities, and distributing benefits in pursuit of producing high-quality local news. We use these findings to propose three ideal types of collaborative practices -here termed the co-op, contractor, and NGO models - which are specific to local news provision and potentially applicable to similar efforts around the world.","[Jenkins, Joy] Univ Tennessee, Sch Journalism & Elect Media, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Graves, Lucas] Univ Wisconsin, Sch Journalism & Mass Commun, Madison, WI 53706 USA",University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Jenkins, J (corresponding author), Univ Tennessee, Sch Journalism & Elect Media, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.",jjenkins@utk.edu,,,Google News Initiative,Google News Initiative(Google Incorporated),This work was supported by Google News Initiative.,,56,1,1,3,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

This study theorizes that, based on the negativity and confirmation biases in audience digital news selection, a pessimistic outlook increases the likelihood of self-selection of more negative and episodic headlines over positive and thematic news. In a next step, news media literacy (NML) literature is consulted to explore how to counter this tendency to, via news selection, confirm an overly negative and distorted worldview. A selective-exposure experiment (N = 612) monitored participants' self-selection of crime news after exposure to NML interventions. Findings show that those participants who hold a more pessimistic outlook on crime in society tend to confirm this worldview by self-selecting into more negative crime news. Exposure to NML interventions concerning negativity bias or click-bait was found to mitigate this negativity bias in news selection, especially for those who already hold a pessimistic outlook This study is the first to document that NML interventions can potentially have merits as a tool to combat negativity bias in online news selection.","[van der Meer, Toni G.

Based on both a real-life implementation of the Tooties and an online experiment, this study provides insights about the feasibility and effectiveness of the Tooties as an innovative type of fact-check intervention compared to some of the more widely used types of fact-check interventions.

Based on in-depth interviews, our findings suggest that, far beyond their origins as comment field moderators, SMEs now play a crucial role in integrating complex behavioral data from social network sites and circulating this data in the newsroom to align news production with perceived audience tastes. Our findings also suggest that while SMEs identify with traditional norms of professional journalism, they also work closely with staff in marketing departments and draw on marketing language and imagery when describing their work. Ultimately, we find that our SME participants experience their increasingly central role in the newsroom in contradictory and ambivalent ways, at times defending traditional professional values, while at other times voicing support for audience sovereignty and giving readers what they want. In this way, if Pierre Bourdieu's field theory suggests that journalism is structured by an ongoing struggle between exogeneous (commercial and marketing) logics and endogenous professional values, the changing roles of SMEs indicate the arrival of a new stage in this struggle - a stage marked by the deep and virtually uncontested advance of marketing terminology and goals into the journalistic field. In this restructured professional field, individual SMEs are thus left with the difficult task of reconciling, at the level of habitus, internalized tensions between ascendant marketing imperatives and residual but still-cherished journalistic dispositions and values.","[Neilson, Tai] Macquarie Univ, Dept Media Commun Creat Arts Language & Literatur, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Gibson, Timothy A.] George Mason Univ, Dept Commun, Fairfax, VA USA",Macquarie University; George Mason University,"Neilson, T (corresponding author), Macquarie Univ, Dept Media Commun Creat Arts Language & Literatur, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",tai.neilson@mq.edu.au,"Gibson, Timothy/GLQ-6090-2022","Gibson, Timothy/0000-0003-3986-8774; Neilson, Tai/0000-0002-5109-5850",,,,,54,3,3,2,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

This window is now believed to be shrinking due to developments in digital media such as algorithmic personalization which restricts people to echo chambers in turn affecting citizens' views on society. It is an example of the moral panics surrounding digital media and obfuscating underlying social dynamics at play. This article seeks to address this issue by looking at news use through the lens of news repertoires. Building on a representative survey of Dutch-speaking Belgian citizens, we identify four archetypical news repertoires (Limited - Panoramic - Traditional - Casual) and investigate how these relate to civic attitudes including civic (dis-) engagement, individualism, and ethnocentrism. In line with previous research, our study shows that age and socio-economic status significantly predict the constellation of one's news repertoire. Furthermore, variances in news repertoires translate into small but significant differences in views on society, particularly between the media-rich Panoramic and media-poor Limited news repertoires regarding ethnocentrism. Finally, we discuss how in order to appease moral media panics, it is not only necessary to substantiate debates on media power with empirical insights on news use, but also to imagine news audiences in a more nuanced way.","[Picone, Ike; Vandenplas, Ruben] Imec SMIT Studies Media Innovat & Technol, Leuven, Belgium; [Picone, Ike] Vrije Univ Brussel, Dept Commun Sci, Fac Social Sci, Brussels, Belgium; [Picone, Ike] Vrije Univ Brussel, Solvay Business Sch, Brussels, Belgium",Vrije Universiteit Brussel; Vrije Universiteit Brussel,"Picone, I (corresponding author), Imec SMIT Studies Media Innovat & Technol, Leuven, Belgium.;Picone, I (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Brussel, Dept Commun Sci, Fac Social Sci, Brussels, Belgium.;Picone, I (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Brussel, Solvay Business Sch, Brussels, Belgium.",ike.picone@vub.be,,"Picone, Ike/0000-0002-0423-3456; Vandenplas, Ruben/0000-0002-4950-7465",,,,,55,0,0,6,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

Mumsnetters' discussion of the news around COVID-19 complicates previous studies' findings that women prefer to discuss news relating to health, education and the local community rather than politics and international affairs. Mumsnetters discuss the COVID-19 pandemic as both a health story and a political story. They use mainly digital journalism sources, either directly from the mainstream news media or indirectly via social media such as Twitter, thus participating in a hybrid media system. However, some Mumsnet discussants demonstrate a hostility and distrust towards mainstream news sources, even suggesting collusion between the media and the UK government, which has implications for the clear dissemination of government messages around the pandemic.","[Pedersen, Sarah; Burnett, Simon] Robert Gordon Univ, Sch Creat & Cultural Business, Aberdeen, Scotland",Robert Gordon University,"Pedersen, S (corresponding author), Robert Gordon Univ, Sch Creat & Cultural Business, Aberdeen, Scotland.",s.pedersen@rgu.ac.uk,,"Pedersen, Sarah/0000-0001-8017-4227",,,,,37,4,4,3,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

Introducing the conceptualization and measurement of the news sharing gap, this study compares the sharing of political news by Facebook users to the production of political news by news media organizations. To paint a broad picture of these differences, we compare the news sharing gap (a) across election and routine periods and (b) across eight countries: Australia, Austria, Brazil, Germany, the Netherlands, Romania, Spain, and the United Kingdom. Analyzing 265,714 articles shared over 12 million times on Facebook, findings show that elections are broadly linked to increases in political news publication, but even larger increases in political news sharing. The study reveals how, overall, political news is shared more often than news publication patterns would suggest, proposing higher political interest by Facebook users than previously thought. In most cases, political news sharing far outpaces political news production in the form of a negative news sharing gap, with the relative demand for political news (in the form of news sharing) being higher than the supply. Lastly, building upon previous work, we propose and validate a distant supervised machine learning method for multilingual, large-scale identification of political news across distinct languages, contexts and time periods.","[de Leon, Ernesto] Univ Bern, Inst Commun & Media Studies, Bern, Switzerland; [Vermeer, Susan] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Commun Res, Amsterdam, CX, Netherlands",University of Bern; University of Amsterdam,"de Leon, E (corresponding author), Univ Bern, Inst Commun & Media Studies, Bern, Switzerland.",ernesto.deleon@unibe.ch,,"de Leon, Ernesto/0000-0003-3152-0722; Vermeer, Susan/0000-0002-9829-8057",,,,,61,0,0,4,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

Through analyzing 16 interviews with women journalists representing different media affiliations, experiences, and demographics, this study explores their varied perceptions of the shifts in journalistic professionalism and press freedom in Egypt, their equally shifting professional roles and struggles, and their varied resistance mechanisms. On the one hand, this study unpacks the multiple challenges facing them, such as restricted journalistic autonomy, limited access to information and technology, sexual harassment, lack of job security, and other forms of professional discrimination, in a male-dominated profession and a patriarchal culture. On the other hand, it investigates the parallel resistance mechanisms they deploy to overcome these challenges. We argue that the amalgamation of these cyclical, push-and-pull dynamics gave birth to a new differentiated media landscape (Schroeder 2018), representing a third space between mainstream media and citizen journalism, the online and the offline, and the old and the new, in a rapidly evolving journalistic field.","[Khamis, Sahar] Univ Maryland, Dept Commun, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [El-Ibiary, Rasha] Future Univ Egypt, Fac Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Polit Mass Media, New Cairo, Egypt",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Future University in Egypt,"Khamis, S (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Dept Commun, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",skhamis@umd.edu,"El-Ibiary, Rasha/V-1575-2018","El-Ibiary, Rasha/0000-0001-9902-0316",,,,,46,0,0,23,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

Our study systematically analyzes qualitative data to present technology-driven, innovative business models and technologies that will be major players in the news industry's future. Results indicated that organizations do not rely on a unique income source but combine different sustainable models of funding. By deploying technological assets in the news business, these outlets are capable of meeting the needs of audiences and better identifying customer segments, which brings a competitive advantage to these organizations.

However, due to the expense and difficulties involved in manual coding, the current situation, in which open-ended questions are used and analyzed in large-scale web surveys, is not satisfactory. This article reviews the types, coding tasks, and automatic coding techniques of open-ended questions. We propose a five-step procedure on how to analyze open-ended questions through an automatic coding approach, the process of which is as follows: (a) locate the type of open-ended question, (b) choose the corresponding coding task, (c) adopt the appropriate automatic coding techniques, (d) perform the analysis, and (e) evaluate and interpret the results. We demonstrate this with survey data from Reuters Digital News Reports of 2019. Our proposed framework can serve as a practical guide for analyzing open-ended questions with automatic coding and also promote open science in journalism research. We conclude that although automatic coding cannot entirely replace human coding, the constant refinement of the statistical models and the promotion of open sharing of textual data will gradually render autocoding a standard tool for researchers in journalism and communication.","[Zhang, Rukun; Xu, Jinghong] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Journalism & Commun, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Gong, Jiankun; Firdaus, Amira] Univ Malaya, Fac Arts & Social Sci, Dept Media & Commun Studies, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Ma, Siyuan] Michigan State Univ, Dept Commun, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Beijing Normal University; Universiti Malaya; Michigan State University,"Xu, JH (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Journalism & Commun, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",123abctg@163.com,"Firdaus, Amira/AAA-5885-2021; Gong, Jiankun/GLU-3582-2022; Gong, Jiankun/ABG-4197-2021; Xu, Jinghong/B-3801-2010","Firdaus, Amira/0000-0002-0609-7371; Xu, Jinghong/0000-0003-4654-0603; Gong, Jiankun/0000-0003-3785-7449; Ma, Siyuan/0000-0002-9644-6298; Zhang, Rukun/0000-0002-6987-9311","National Social Science Fund of China, Research on the Establishment of Omnimedia Communication System [20ZDA057]; National Office for Philosophy and Social Sciences","National Social Science Fund of China, Research on the Establishment of Omnimedia Communication System; National Office for Philosophy and Social Sciences","This article has been produced as part of the major project of the National Social Science Fund of China, Research on the Establishment of Omnimedia Communication System (Grant No. 20ZDA057).

Recent updates to cascading activation, originally developed to explain how frames flowing from powerful figures gain public dominance, give greater theoretical scope for audiences to exert influence. Yet empirical understanding of how and in what circumstances this happens with respect to agenda-setting-another core media effect-is not well-developed, especially given the affordances of digital technologies. We address this gap by connecting theorization on cascades to developments in intermedia agenda-setting. Specifically, we analyze the dynamics surrounding the perceived reluctance by ARD-aktuell, the newsroom of Germany's public broadcasting consortium, to use its prime-time broadcast Tagesschau to report the arrest of a refugee accused of murdering a German woman in December 2016. By presenting finely grained timelines linking content analysis of 5,409 Facebook comments with Tagesschau editorial responses and parallel media coverage of this event, we contribute further conditions under which audience-informed cascades may occur: notably, when publicly funded news organizations are involved, and the issue at stake invokes both domestic and international aspects which sustain disagreement.","[Landis, Benjamin Till] Univ Oxford, Lincoln Coll, Oxford, Oxon, England; [Allen, William L.] Univ Oxford, Dept Polit & Int Relat DPIR, Oxford, Oxon, England; [Allen, William L.] Univ Oxford, Ctr Migrat Policy & Soc COMPAS, Oxford, Oxon, England",University of Oxford; University of Oxford; University of Oxford,"Allen, WL (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Dept Polit & Int Relat DPIR, Oxford, Oxon, England.;Allen, WL (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Ctr Migrat Policy & Soc COMPAS, Oxford, Oxon, England.",william.allen@politics.ox.ac.uk,"Allen, William/H-9007-2019","Allen, William/0000-0003-3185-1468",,,,,57,1,1,8,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

Greater transparency of how political actors are using digital ads is necessary given concerns that they may be using digital ads to suppress voter turnout and spread disinformation and xenophobia. We apply a human-centered design framework to identify the design requirements necessary to create tools that satisfy journalists' needs for covering digital political ads. Based on interviews with journalists, our findings indicate that they are interested in covering how political actors are using digital advertising as well as reporting on the platforms, such as their policies. Our findings also reveal serious obstacles that impede journalists' ability to effectively cover digital political advertising. From the currently available tools, journalists we interviewed found it difficult to quickly identify key takeaways that could result in or contribute to stories. Journalists also need information that the most popular technology platforms do not offer. Supporting journalists' efforts to provide greater transparency of digital political ads will require a collective effort on the part of designers and technology platforms to provide information that journalists need via tools that surface and synthesize this information in a way that satisfies journalists' professional demands.","[McKernan, Brian; Stromer-Galley, Jennifer; Korsunska, Ania; Bolden, Sarah E.; Hemsley, Jeff] Syracuse Univ, Sch Informat Studies, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA; [Rossini, Patricia] Univ Liverpool, Dept Commun & Media, Liverpool, Merseyside, England",Syracuse University; University of Liverpool,"McKernan, B (corresponding author), Syracuse Univ, Sch Informat Studies, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA.",bmckerna@syr.edu,,"McKernan, Brian/0000-0001-5565-1183; Goncalves da Conceicao Rossini, Patricia/0000-0002-4463-6444; Bolden, Sarah/0000-0002-8992-1580; Korsunska, Ania/0000-0003-3158-8436; Stromer-Galley, Jennifer/0000-0001-6079-8788",,,,,36,0,0,2,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

The current research paradigm, however, holds a narrow (mostly user-centered) perspective on the recommendation task. This makes it difficult to understand that their design is in fact the result of a negotiation process among multiple actors involved, such as editors, business executives, technologists and users. To remedy this, a multi-stakeholder recommendation paradigm has been suggested among recommender systems scholars. This work sets out to explore to what extent this paradigm is applicable to the particular context of news recommenders. We conducted 11 interviews with professionals from three leading media companies in Flanders (Belgium) and find that the development of news recommenders is indeed characterized by a negotiation process among multiple stakeholders. However, our results show that the initial multi-stakeholder framework is not adequately accommodating some of our findings, such as the existence of preconditions, the role of product owners, and the indirect involvement of particular stakeholders. Based on our analysis, we suggest an elaborated framework for multi-stakeholder news recommenders that can contribute to scholarship by providing a multi-sided perspective towards the understanding of news recommenders.","[Smets, Annelien; Hendrickx, Jonathan; Ballon, Pieter] Vrije Univ Brussel, IMEC, SMIT, Brussels, Belgium",IMEC; Vrije Universiteit Brussel,"Smets, A (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Brussel, IMEC, SMIT, Brussels, Belgium.",annelien.smets@vub.be,"Smets, Annelien/AFL-7264-2022","Smets, Annelien/0000-0003-4771-7159; Hendrickx, Jonathan/0000-0003-2802-2802",,,,,49,3,3,4,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

It aims to bridge two discussions. First, the journalism studies literature that has explored how automation challenges the way editors and journalists fulfil their role in newsrooms and society. Second, the legal discussion that is revisiting how the conditions for editorial independence can be created in a media system where automation is increasingly important. To do so, this article contrasts a normative framework that outlines the functions of editorial independence in European media law with interviews with editors and journalists involved in data journalism and news personalisation. It finds excellent potential for a complementary relationship between legal and journalistic perspectives on editorial independence. However, the challenges posed by automation fall outside the mechanisms through which this relationship has traditionally been operationalised.","[van Drunen, M.

We identify a factor that, alongside accuracy, drives the sharing of true and fake news: the 'interestingness-if-true' of a piece of news. In three pre-registered experiments (N = 904), participants were presented with a series of true and fake news, and asked to rate the accuracy of the news, how interesting the news would be if it were true, and how likely they would be to share it. Participants were more willing to share news they found more interesting-if-true, as well as news they deemed more accurate. They deemed fake news less accurate but more interesting-if-true than true news, and were more likely to share true news than fake news. As expected, interestingness-if-true differed from interestingness and accuracy, and had good face validity. Higher trust in mass media was associated with a greater ability to discern true from fake news, and participants rated as more accurate news that they had already been exposed to (especially for true news). We argue that people may not share news of questionable accuracy by mistake, but instead because the news has qualities that compensate for its potential inaccuracy, such as being interesting-if-true.","[Altay, Sacha; de Araujo, Emma; Mercier, Hugo] PSL Univ, Inst Jean Nicod, Dept Etud Cognit, ENS,EHESS,CNRS, Paris, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; PSL Research University Paris; Ecole Normale Superieure (ENS); Universite Paris Cite,"Mercier, H (corresponding author), PSL Univ, Inst Jean Nicod, Dept Etud Cognit, ENS,EHESS,CNRS, Paris, France.",hugo.mercier@gmail.com,"Altay, Sacha/AAD-9245-2021","Yesilaltay, Sacha/0000-0002-2839-7375","EUR FrontCog grant [ANR-17-EURE-0017, ANR-10-IDEX-000102]; grant CONFIRMA from the Direction Generale de L'armement (DGA); DGA",EUR FrontCog grant; grant CONFIRMA from the Direction Generale de L'armement (DGA); DGA,"This research was supported by the grant EUR FrontCog ANR-17-EURE-0017, ANR-10-IDEX-000102 to PSL and the grant CONFIRMA from the Direction Generale de L'armement (DGA).

To answer this question, I have fleshed out the concept of Valuable Journalism by performing a meta-analysis of the results of twenty-two audience research projects (2005-2020) involving 3068 informants. By focussing on what audiences experience as valuable journalism, rather than on its content or approach, I will demonstrate how Valuable Journalism crystallized over the years into three key experiences: Learning something new, Getting recognition and Increasing mutual understanding. In the final part of the paper, I address the challenges raised by Valuable Journalism for practicing journalists and journalism scholars.","[Meijer, Irene Costera] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Language Literature & Commun, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Meijer, IC (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Language Literature & Commun, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",icostera.meijer@vu.nl,,,,,,,85,7,7,3,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

Economies of scale play a central role in the newspaper business, but in a context of falling incomes, the major route to take advantage of them is the reduction in the asset size and operating costs. The digital business model can be a way to increase companies' profitability, as online-only media publishers do not need as many assets and costs as their print counterparts to operate. Digitalisation is particularly interesting for local news outlets, since they operate in small markets and could have difficulties to reach an optimal size. However, there are little empirical evidence on how digital business models influence the profitability of newspapers. Using a sample of 198 and 69 Spanish print and online-only media publishers, respectively, during the period 2008-2018 and applying a dynamic panel data methodology, this article analyses the extent to which the main features defining print vs. digital business models affect firms' profitability.

Consequently, studying the perspective of audiences tends to automatically start from questions relevant for and benefitting the news industry. In this introduction, we argue for a more radical audience turn that pushes journalism studies forward beyond normative and industry concerns, and starts from the perspective of audiences themselves. We formulate four constructive starting points for advancing the audience turn in journalism: 1) further decentering journalism by also focusing on non-news and employing non-media centric approaches; 2) broadening who counts as audience by including audiences considered commercially unattractive; 3) shifting the focus from what counts as news use to what is experienced as informative; and 4) positing audiences as active agents. However, such a radical audience turn also creates fundamental dilemmas for journalism studies, raising questions about the field's object of study, the spaces and contexts of news use considered, and the objectives of journalism studies as a field. With this special issue, we call for further reflections on how news and informational needs may be conceptualized from an audience perspective and how to theorize what this means for journalism's role in society and everyday life.","[Swart, Joelle; Broersma, Marcel] Univ Groningen, Ctr Media & Journalism Studies, Groningen, Netherlands; [Kormelink, Tim Groot; Meijer, Irene Costera] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Language Literature & Commun, Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Groningen; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Swart, J (corresponding author), Univ Groningen, Ctr Media & Journalism Studies, Groningen, Netherlands.",j.a.c.swart@rug.nl,,"Broersma, Marcel/0000-0002-7342-3472; Groot Kormelink, Tim/0000-0001-5374-7536",Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO),Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)),The Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO).,,85,3,3,5,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

To do so, we conducted an online experiment (n = 337) in a virtual news environment with four different news recommenders, including three news recommenders that aimed to stimulate diverse news exposure. The results show that all diversity-based news recommenders steered users towards more diverse exposure behaviour, with a personalised diversity-based news recommender being the most effective. We also found that people using a diversity-based news recommender did not think they read more diversely, pointing towards a so-called diversity paradox. We discuss what this paradox means and how it relates to the secretive nature of news algorithms. We also make a call to policymakers, news organisations and scholars to give transparency and diversity-based news recommenders a more pronounced place in the news environment and in future news recommendation research.","[Joris, Glen; Van Damme, Kristin; Mechant, Peter; De Marez, Lieven] Univ Ghent, Dept Commun Sci, Imec Mict UGent, Ghent, Belgium; [Joris, Glen; Van Damme, Kristin] Univ Ghent, Ctr Journalism Studies CJS, Dept Commun Sci, Ghent, Belgium; [Vercoutere, Stefaan] Univ Ghent, Dept Informat Technol, Imec Waves UGent, Ghent, Belgium; [De Clercq, Orphee] Univ Ghent, Dept Translat Interpreting & Commun, Language & Translat Technol Team LT3, Ghent, Belgium; [Van Damme, Kristin] Artevelde Univ Appl Sci, Res & Dev Ctr Commun Media & Design, Ghent, Belgium",Ghent University; Ghent University; Ghent University; Ghent University; Artevelde University of Applied Sciences,"Joris, G (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Dept Commun Sci, Imec Mict UGent, Ghent, Belgium.;Joris, G (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Ctr Journalism Studies CJS, Dept Commun Sci, Ghent, Belgium.",glen.joris@ugent.be,,"De Marez, Lieven/0000-0001-7716-4079; Vercoutere, Stefaan/0000-0002-2035-256X",Ghent University [BOFGOA2018000601],Ghent University(Ghent University),This work was supported by Ghent University under grant BOFGOA2018000601.,,49,0,0,6,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

Despite raised concerns over potential impacts of deepfakes on people's credibility toward audio-visual evidence in journalism, systematic investigation of the topic has been lacking. This study conducted an experiment (N=230) that tested (1) how a news article using deepfake video (vs. real video) affects news credibility and viral behavioral intentions and (2) whether, based on signaling theory, obtaining knowledge about the low cost of producing deepfakes reduces the impact of deepfake news. Results show that people whose pre-existing attitudes toward controversial issues (abortion, marijuana legalization) are congruent with the advocated position of a news article are more likely to believe and be willing to share deepfake news as much as real video news. In addition, educating participants about the low cost of producing deepfakes was effective in reducing the credibility and viral behavioral intention of deepfake news for those who have congruent issue attitudes. This study provides evidence for differing levels of susceptibility for deepfake news and the importance of media literacy education regarding deepfakes that would prevent biased reasoning.","[Shin, Soo Yun] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Communicol, Honolulu, HI USA; [Lee, Jiyoung] Univ Alabama, Dept Journalism & Creat Media, Tuscaloosa, AL USA",University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa,"Shin, SY (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Commun, Seoul, South Korea.",shinsy@hawaii.edu,,"Shin, Soo Yun/0000-0002-2678-7388",University of Hawaii at Manoa; University of Alabama,University of Hawaii at Manoa; University of Alabama,This work was supported by University of Hawaii at Manoa and The University of Alabama.,,55,1,1,21,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

We propose a framework that demonstrates the relationships between local news consumption experiences, reading behaviours, and audience retention. We analysed individual-level clickstream data and payment records of subscribers of a regional newspaper to track the changes in their news reading behaviours and renewal decisions before and after the virus outbreak. We found that reading behaviours spiked since the beginning of the pandemic and gradually decreased but remained at a relatively higher level compared to the same period in previous years. We also found that reading news on COVID-19 or local issues and signing up for email newsletters for local news or sports positively influenced establishing the regularity of online local news consumption. The regularity of consuming local news on the site, in turn, positively impacted audience retention, demonstrating the importance of building the habit of online news consumption by providing the value that current and potential subscribers seek from their digital news consumption experiences.","[Kim, Su Jung] Univ Southern Calif, Annenberg Sch Commun & Journalism, Strateg Publ Relat, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA; [Wang, Xiaohan] Dexcom, San Diego, CA USA; [Malthouse, Edward C.] Northwestern Univ, Integrated Mkt Commun, Medill Sch Journalism Media Integrated Mkt Commun, Evanston, IL USA",University of Southern California; Northwestern University,"Kim, SJ (corresponding author), Univ Southern Calif, Annenberg Sch Commun & Journalism, Strateg Publ Relat, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA.",sujung.kim@usc.edu,"Kim, Su Jung/Q-2438-2019","Kim, Su Jung/0000-0003-2025-4019; Malthouse, Edward/0000-0001-7077-0172; Wang, Xiaohan/0000-0002-3978-1946",Lilly Endowment; Myrta Pulliam Charitable Trust,Lilly Endowment; Myrta Pulliam Charitable Trust,"The authors would like to thank the Northwestern Local News Initiative (LNI) and the Spiegel Research Center (SRC) for giving us access to the data for this research.

One of the avenues to address this challenge is the practice of social correction-the correction of misinformation conducted by other social media users. While social correction focuses on individuals in the context of their respective social media networks, we offer the concept of collective social correction: an ongoing practice of information verification, occurring within group contexts. Employing a mixed-methods approach, we examine collective social correction by analysing the case study of a large-scale Israeli WhatsApp group, led by a journalist, and devoted to informal discussion of politics and news. Our findings point at the importance of active, discursive processes of information verification in the current media environment, particularly when it comes to political (mis)information. The study further highlights the role of group dynamics and group norms-modelled by the behaviour of everyday participants as well as of the group admin-in promoting the adoption of journalistic practices of fact-checking and source vetting and increasing participant accountability. Finally, the paper considers to what extent the interplay between social dynamics and information verification processes can inform our understanding of other, non-specialized group contexts as well.","[Kligler-Vilenchik, Neta] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Commun & Journalism, Jerusalem, Israel",Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"Kligler-Vilenchik, N (corresponding author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Commun & Journalism, Jerusalem, Israel.",Neta.kv@mail.huji.ac.il,,"Kligler-Vilenchik, Neta/0000-0003-3470-3305",WhatsApp Misinformation and Social Science Research Award,WhatsApp Misinformation and Social Science Research Award,"This research was supported by the WhatsApp Misinformation and Social Science Research Award, granted to the author as an unrestricted research gift.",,29,3,3,5,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

Young adults are especially intriguing in this regard, as they have grown up in digital environments, are less willing to pay for journalism, and lack key historical catalysts for the formation of news habits. Accordingly, this article investigates the information repertoires of this group, using a mixed-method approach to focus upon the preferences and experiences of Danish youth, aged 18-24. Crafting an innovative research design integrating individual interviews, Q-sort methodology, and think aloud protocols, the article explores five repertoires: the online traditionalist, depth-seeking audiophile, digital news seeker, interpersonal networker, and non-news information seeker. In these repertoires, traditional journalistic media is often eschewed, while new media come to the fore. The paper also examines two analytical themes cutting across repertoires: a tension between the seamlessness of where news is (platform newsiness) versus how it is conceptualized (traditional journalism); and the guiding role of face-to-face communication and social networks when engaging with news. In sum, by exploring the formation of information repertoires at this crucial life stage, the article provides insights into a key demographic, whose practices and preferences shape the news industry's ongoing sustainability.","[Peters, Chris; Schroder, Kim Christian; Lehaff, Josephine; Vulpius, Julie] Roskilde Univ, Commun & Arts, Roskilde, Denmark",Roskilde University,"Peters, C (corresponding author), Roskilde Univ, Commun & Arts, Roskilde, Denmark.",cpeters@ruc.dk,"Vulpius, Julie/DJA-8363-2022","Vulpius, Julie/0000-0002-2118-2945; Lehaff, Josephine/0000-0002-3906-3610; Schroder, Kim Christian/0000-0002-5437-4249; Peters, Chris/0000-0002-5813-1674",Independent Research Fund Denmark [8018-00061B],Independent Research Fund Denmark,"This article is part of the research project Beyond the Here and Now of News, funded by the Independent Research Fund Denmark under grant number 8018-00061B.

It shows how journalists use core skills and competencies to verify the information and it describes why false information evades the journalistic filter and gets published. We combined semi-structured interviews with a think-aloud method in which 20 Estonian journalists were shown constructed episodes of false information and then asked to discuss them. Based on the results, we argue that journalists use traditional fact-checking skills in specific combinations, which is usually sufficient to validate the information. However, when under time pressure, journalists tend to trust their professional experience and take the risk of publishing unchecked information. This risk is even higher when the source seems to be trustworthy and the information is presented on an official social media platform or on the journalist's personal social media page, or if the journalist lacks more indepth knowledge about a specific topic. Video manipulation (e.g. deep fake) and decontextualised photo presentations are the most difficult for journalists to verify, and that is similar regardless of the platform the journalist specialises in. The results of this study are useful for training journalism students and practicing journalists in how to debunk false information.","[Himma-Kadakas, Marju] Karlstad Univ, Dept Geog Media & Commun, Karlstad, Sweden; [Ojamets, Indrek] Univ Tartu, Dept Social Studies, Tartu, Estonia",Karlstad University; University of Tartu,"Himma-Kadakas, M (corresponding author), Karlstad Univ, Dept Geog Media & Commun, Karlstad, Sweden.",marju.himma-kadakas@kau.se,"Himma-Kadakas, Marju/B-5244-2018","Himma-Kadakas, Marju/0000-0001-9441-7162",Ander Foundation: Anne Marie och Gustav Anders Stiftelse for mediaforskning,Ander Foundation: Anne Marie och Gustav Anders Stiftelse for mediaforskning,The research was partly supported by the Ander Foundation: Anne Marie och Gustav Anders Stiftelse for mediaforskning.,,48,2,2,9,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

Data regarding the perception of the watchdog role stem from the Worlds of Journalism Survey, whereas evidence concerning the presence of the watchdog function derives from a content analysis of 2,792 fact-checks published by FactCheck.org (United States), Pagella Politica (Italy), Correctiv (Germany), and Lupa (Brazil). While fact-checkers working for Correctiv rarely addressed declarations by political agents, those contributing to FactCheck.org prioritized verifying statements by former President Trump. In turn, Pagella Politica fact-checkers recurrently used assertive labels to stress the falsehood of public remarks, whilst true is the most used label in the Lupa case. There is correspondence between professionals' conceptions about their role and the watchdog stance agencies perform in most cases. The manuscript also discusses how idiosyncrasies featuring each professional culture and specific traits of media systems influence fact-checkers' work. Lastly, we hold that in some settings fact-checking may outline new frontiers for the notion of watchdog journalism, taking the journalistic voice to unprecedented levels of adversarialism.","[Ferracioli, Paulo] Univ Estado Rio De Janeiro, Inst Social & Polit Studies, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Kniess, Andressa Butture; Marques, Francisco Paulo Jamil] Univ Fed Parana, Dept Polit Sci, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil",Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro; Universidade Federal do Parana,"Marques, FPJ (corresponding author), Univ Fed Parana, Dept Polit Sci, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil.",marquesjamil@gmail.com,"Ferracioli, Paulo/AGH-5639-2022; Marques, Francisco Paulo Jamil/D-3343-2009","Ferracioli, Paulo/0000-0001-9355-3365; Marques, Francisco Paulo Jamil/0000-0002-5256-1964; Kniess, Andressa Butture/0000-0002-1337-5376","Brazilian National Scientific Council (CNPq) [310724/2020-1]; Brazilian Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES) [001, 88887.478242/2020-00]",Brazilian National Scientific Council (CNPq)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)Fundacao de Apoio a Pesquisa do Distrito Federal (FAPDF)); Brazilian Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)),This research was funded by the Brazilian National Scientific Council (CNPq) (310724/2020-1) and by the Brazilian Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES) (001 and 88887.478242/2020-00).,,103,1,1,6,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

Research has coalesced around the idea that no single approach will work in all contexts, and effective strategies need to include media literacy, fact-checking, changes in how news is produced and circulated, government oversight, and regulations as well as responses that take local contexts into account. Using data from 36 focus groups in six sub-Saharan African countries, we examine audiences' experiences with misinformation and perceptions of institutional and personal roles and responsibility for both preventing and intervening in the spread of misinformation. First, we examine perceptions of misinformation with a particular focus on whether misinformation is perceived as a problem. Second, we examine perceived responsibility for addressing misinformation and possible solutions to the problem. Findings suggest that participants perceive misinformation as a problem if it has real or potential negative consequences and express a sense of shared responsibility among individuals and institutions for stopping the spread of misinformation.","[Tully, Melissa] Univ Iowa, Sch Journalism & Mass Commun, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Madrid-Morales, Dani] Univ Houston, Jack J Valenti Sch Commun, Houston, TX USA; [Wasserman, Herman] Univ Cape Town, Ctr Film & Media Studies, Cape Town, South Africa; [Gondwe, Gregory] Univ Colorado Bolder, Dept Journalism, Boulder, CO USA; [Ireri, Kioko] US Int Univ Africa, Dept Journalism & Corp Commun, Nairobi, Kenya; [Gondwe, Gregory] Calif State Univ San Bernardino, Dept Commun, San Bernardino, CA 92407 USA",University of Iowa; University of Houston System; University of Houston; University of Cape Town; United States International University Africa; California State University System; California State University San Bernardino,"Tully, M (corresponding author), Univ Iowa, Sch Journalism & Mass Commun, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.",melissa-tully@uiowa.edu,"Tully, Melissa/AAD-1283-2022; Madrid-Morales, Dani/I-7902-2019; Gondwe, Gregory/K-5960-2019","Madrid-Morales, Dani/0000-0002-1522-5857; Gondwe, Gregory/0000-0001-7444-2731; IRERI, KIOKO/0000-0002-3932-0365; Tully, Melissa/0000-0003-1850-3477",,,,,49,3,3,4,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

A potential mechanism that may reverse this trend is independent fact-checking to adjudicate competing claims in news stories. We undertake a survey experiment on a sample of 1608 Australians to test the effects of fact-checking on media trust using a real-life case study known as the sports rorts affair. We construct duplicate news articles from two national media outlets (i.e. ABC.net.au , news.com.au ) containing a senior government minister's real-life false claim that public funds were not used for political advantage immediately before an election. Half of the participants are exposed to a third-party fact check, which confirms the Minister's claim is verifiably false, the other half are not. All respondents are asked to evaluate the story's and news outlets' trustworthiness. Contrary to our expectations we find a backfire effect whereby independent fact-checking decreases readers' trust in the original news story and outlet. This negative relationship is not conditional on partisanship or the media source. Our study provides a cautionary tale for those expecting third-party fact-checks to increase media trust and we outline several avenues by which fact-checkers might overcome this.","[Carson, Andrea] La Trobe Univ, Dept Polit Media & Philosophy, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Gibbons, Andrew] Univ Texas Austin, Edward A Clark Ctr Australian & New Zealand Studi, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Martin, Aaron] Univ Melbourne, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Phillips, Justin B.] Univ Waikato, Sch Social Sci, Hamilton, New Zealand",La Trobe University; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; University of Melbourne; University of Waikato,"Carson, A (corresponding author), La Trobe Univ, Dept Polit Media & Philosophy, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",a.carson@latrobe.edu.au,"Carson, Andrea/AAH-2320-2019","Carson, Andrea/0000-0001-5503-3334; Gibbons, Andrew/0000-0001-7175-7770; Phillips, Justin Bonest/0000-0002-2984-4472","La Trobe University; University of Melbourne, Policy Lab, Faculty of Arts","La Trobe University; University of Melbourne, Policy Lab, Faculty of Arts","The study was funded by La Trobe University academic start-up grant and University of Melbourne, Policy Lab, Faculty of Arts.",,57,1,1,6,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

AI policies are the main mechanisms that establish and organise the hierarchies among these institutions. Few studies, however, have explored the normative dimension of AI in policymaking in journalism, especially beyond the West. This case study inspects the copyright law's impact on AI innovation in newsrooms in the unexamined Chinese context. Using neo-institutional theory and policy network theory, the study investigates the Third Amendment to the Chinese Copyright Law, exemplary court cases regarding automated journalism copyright disputes (such as Tencent v. Yingxun and Film v. Baidu), and other supporting documents. The findings show how China's copyright legal framework separates authorship and ownership; defines originality and creativity in human-machine collaboration; and prioritises tech companies while undermining journalistic autonomy. We argue that the law's eager embrace of AI may give tech companies an advantage over news organisations that do not necessarily have a strategy to adopt AI. Moreover, it favours state-owned, resource-rich official media over the private sector.

Social media capital is conceptualized as the resources that news organizations can generate via social media efforts, and measured by examining each outlet's audience size and engagement metrics on Twitter. To triangulate findings, we used social media metrics extracted from (1) the entire population of Twitter users, as well as (2) a representative sample of U.S. Twitter users whose demographics were identified through a survey. Our results suggest that journalistic reputation is a reliable predictor of a news outlet's social media capital. News site quality, however, was not significantly associated with social media metrics. In fact, the quality of news sites was at times related negatively to social media capital, such that, controlling for other factors, news from low-quality sites received more retweets than news from high-quality sites. This pattern was especially pronounced among politically conservative users.","[Shin, Jieun] Univ Florida, Media Prod Management Technol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Ognyanova, Katherine] Rutgers State Univ, Sch Commun & Informat, New Brunswick, NJ USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; Rutgers State University New Brunswick,"Shin, J (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Media Prod Management Technol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",jieun.shin@ufl.edu,"Ognyanova, Katherine/M-4824-2019","Ognyanova, Katherine/0000-0003-3038-7077; Shin, Jieun/0000-0001-7416-0240",College of Journalism and Communications at the University of Florida,College of Journalism and Communications at the University of Florida,This study was supported by the College of Journalism and Communications at the University of Florida.,,78,1,1,15,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

It distinguishes between a journalistic logic, in which referencing practices follow established journalistic ways of ensuring facticity and context, and a movement logic, in which references are used to obtain political, movement-oriented goals of dismissing opponents, supporting your allies, multiplying forces and building a community. Based on a manual quantitative content analysis of more than 4,500 references extracted from 1,000 randomly selected articles by 20 right-wing alternative news media from six countries (US, UK, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Denmark), the article shows that alternative news media predominantly follow a journalistic logic in their referencing practices, though at the expense of a limited originality of sources. Despite their anti-mainstream ambition, alternative news media frequently refer to mainstream media, but only rarely dismiss or re-frame content published by these media. The article discusses these practices as an expression of the hybrid nature of alternative news media situated at the boundary between journalism and political activism. Moreover, it addresses broader implications for the relationship between alternative and mainstream journalistic practice in the digital realm.","[Mayerhoffer, Eva; Heft, Annett] Roskilde Univ, Dept Commun & Arts, Roskilde, Denmark; [Heft, Annett] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Media & Commun Studies, Berlin, Germany; [Heft, Annett] Weizenbaum Inst Networked Soc, Berlin, Germany",Roskilde University; Free University of Berlin,"Mayerhoffer, E (corresponding author), Roskilde Univ, Dept Commun & Arts, Roskilde, Denmark.",evamay@ruc.dk,,"Mayerhoffer, Eva/0000-0002-4644-9060",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research [16DII114],German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"This work was supported by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research, funding code 16DII114.",,40,5,5,2,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

The framework is developed through design thinking and builds around principles from the field of design. It uses virtual meeting technologies to organize small-group conversations, allows for creative and playful activities to help people share stories and feelings, and aims to create an ambient atmosphere of mutual understanding and co-creative problem-solving. With this article, we aspire to initiate a conversation around the value of pollinating journalism studies with concepts and principles from design thinking and facilitation so that journalists could become empowered to connect with their audiences with greater empathy and compassion and thereby surface diverse and rich lived experiences using more active and reflective listening skills. To test the framework's potential for enhancing engaged journalism curricula, we collaborated with 17 journalism students at a U.S. university in a series of activities, from initial training on the platform to hosting a conversation using the GDF to ultimately producing a news story based on the insights acquired through this design-centered approach.","[Dimitrakopoulou, Dimitra] MIT, Ctr Construct Commun, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Dimitrakopoulou, Dimitra] Univ Zurich, Dept Commun & Media Res, Zurich, Switzerland; [Lewis, Seth C.] Univ Oregon, Sch Journalism & Commun, Eugene, OR 97403 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); University of Zurich; University of Oregon,"Dimitrakopoulou, D (corresponding author), MIT, Ctr Construct Commun, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.;Dimitrakopoulou, D (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Dept Commun & Media Res, Zurich, Switzerland.",dimitrad@mit.edu,,"Lewis, Seth/0000-0001-7498-0599",European Union [844167],European Union(European Commission),This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement No 844167.,,57,0,0,2,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

We argue that a topically heterogeneous landscape of right-wing populist alternative news outlets could maximize the reach of right-wing populist messages. Using LDA topic modeling, we explore the topical structures of nine different outlets (n = 66,965 articles) and empirically identify meaningful groups of outlets. Our analyses suggest the existence of two topically heterogeneous clusters of alternative news media: (1) core right-wing populist outlets, with around 45-50% of articles coming from topics that are related to right-wing or populist politics; and (2) topically diverse outlets. The latter group's topic selection also reveals right-wing populist partisanship, but less prominently so, while putting more emphasis on general interest news topics, such as sports, economy, or international relations. This group also includes Russian state-owned RT deutsch and Falun Gong-affiliated Epoch Times whose institutional roots, however, are only partially reflected in their topic selection. Additionally, longitudinal analyses reveal an increase of populism-related topics in both groups around the election date of the 2017 German federal election.","[Mueller, Philipp; Freudenthaler, Rainer] Univ Mannheim, Inst Media & Commun Res, Mannheim, Germany",University of Mannheim,"Muller, P (corresponding author), Univ Mannheim, Inst Media & Commun Res, Mannheim, Germany.",p.mueller@uni-mannheim.de,,"Freudenthaler, Rainer/0000-0002-9075-1232; Muller, Philipp/0000-0002-5351-0608",,,,,69,2,2,3,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

This article conceptualizes fact-checking as infrastructure and constructs a mixed-methods approach to examine overlaps and differences and thereby detect biases to increase transparency in COVID-19 misinformation infrastructure at scale. Analyzing Poynter and Google as such overarching infrastructures, we found only a small overlap. Fewer fact-checkers contribute to Google, with fewer stories than to Poynter. 75% of claims in Google are fact-checked by Asian and North American fact-checkers (44% for Poynter) but none by South Americans (20% for Poynter). More stories in Poynter originate from Facebook than outside social media (43% vs. 17%), while Google shows the opposite (16% vs. 38%). In Google, claims originate to a larger extent from public persons. We find similar large topics on statistics and cures, but also differences regarding smaller topics (e.g., vaccines) and types of misinformation (e.g., virus characteristics). Thus, the article shows that the infrastructures have inherent biases and argue that making visible such biases will increase transparency for stakeholders using it.","[Nissen, Ida Anthonj; Walter, Jessica Gabriele; Charquero-Ballester, Marina; Bechmann, Anja] Aarhus Univ, DATALAB Ctr Digital Social Res, Aarhus, Denmark",Aarhus University,"Bechmann, A (corresponding author), Aarhus Univ, DATALAB Ctr Digital Social Res, Aarhus, Denmark.",anjabechmann@cc.au.dk,"Walter, Jessica/GRJ-7295-2022","Bechmann, Anja/0000-0002-5588-5155; Nissen, Ida A./0000-0001-6910-1967; Walter, Jessica/0000-0003-1593-3260","European Horizon 2020 grant [825469, 825652]; EU CEF grant [2394203]",European Horizon 2020 grant; EU CEF grant,"The research was funded by European Horizon 2020 grant number 825469 and 825652, and EU CEF grant number 2394203.",,60,1,1,5,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

Despite the volatile climate around journalists as they cover increasingly dangerous protests (Luqiu, 2020), there is minimal understanding as to the effect of these events on them (Talabi, et al., 2021). Furthermore, there is a gap in the hostility literature examining harassment that journalists face in the field. Through a survey of U.S. journalists, this study finds that covering protests causes journalists mental and emotional health concerns, which influences how they view their journalistic roles. Furthermore, the effects of positive and negative encounters at protests affected journalists personally, depending on who the perpetrator was (protestor or law enforcement)-influencing everything from PTSD and anxiety to intentions to leave journalism. The paper ultimately underscores the need for news organizations to make sure journalists not only are safe, but also feel safe, when reporting in the field.","[Miller, Kaitlin C.] Univ Alabama, Dept Journalism & Creat Media, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA; [Kocan, Samantha] Univ Alabama, Journalism & Creat Media, 432A Reese Phifer Hall, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA",University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa; University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa,"Miller, KC (corresponding author), Univ Alabama, Journalism & Creat Media, 432A Reese Phifer Hall, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA.",Kcmiller6@ua.edu,,,"Office of Research and Economic Development, University of Alabama [A21-0164-001]","Office of Research and Economic Development, University of Alabama","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by Office of Research and Economic Development, University of Alabama (grant no.

Without these editorial cues, how do users process news cues to judge news quality in conformity to professional standards? Relying on dual information processing literature, this study investigates five combinations of news content/formal cue processing to identify user information processing mechanisms for news quality judgment conformity to professional standards. A total of 88 news articles were evaluated by 3547 survey respondents and two professional editors. Based on the partial-least-squares structural equation modeling, we found that the joint functioning of content/formal cue processing better explains news quality judgment conformity than other combinations (such as the independent functioning of each cue processing and the biased functioning of content cue processing affected by formal cue processing). The large, negative effect of joint functioning suggests that the less the respondents relied on formal cues, the greater they achieved news quality judgment conformity as they elaborated more on content cues. Elaboration on a given article's believability/depth as a content cue and heuristics regarding its number of quotes as a formal cue had greater impact on judgment conformity. These results imply how the elaborative and heuristic routes of news processing interact and in what ways news cues can be processed to identify quality news which is necessary for democratic decision making.","[Choi, Sujin] Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Media, 26 Kyungheedae Ro, Seoul 02447, South Korea",Kyung Hee University,"Choi, S (corresponding author), Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Media, 26 Kyungheedae Ro, Seoul 02447, South Korea.",sujinchoi@khu.ac.kr,,,"Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea; National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2018S1A5A2A03035181, KHSIRB-18-069]","Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea)","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study was supported by the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea and the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF-2018S1A5A2A03035181).

The people who have been left behind, and particularly the missing persons' loved ones, seek to frame missingness stories in such a way as to make them newsworthy. However, civilian missingness lacks both cultural scripts and an end to the stories. Thus, I argue, those left behind must use meta-narratives to assert the newsworthiness of these stories. Based on narrative ethnography, I explore two kinds of framings that are used, both reflecting an acceptance of the life/death dichotomy. The first framing (the child of us all), is collective in form, and derives from stories with a wide cultural resonance such as cases of missing soldiers. The second framing (it can happen to anyone), which highlights individualism, borrows from a common framing of missing persons in the US, particularly about missing young white women. Ultimately, both framings generally fail to achieve wide resonance in Israel. Together with the failure to achieve an ontological solution, I argue, missingness might then be constructed as a stable category. This category has the potential to be a subversive one, creating new cultural scripts that challenge meta-narratives as well as the distinction between life and death.","[Katz, Ori] Univ Bath, Ctr Death & Soc, Bath, Avon, England",University of Bath,"Katz, O (corresponding author), Univ Bath, Ctr Death & Soc, Dept Social & Policy Sci, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England.",ok384@bath.ac.uk,"Katz, Ori/AAD-7060-2019","Katz, Ori/0000-0001-5225-342X",,,,,30,0,0,2,2,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,,,,,,,,,,,1.46E+16,10.1177/14648849211064081,0.0,,Mar-22,18,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,0D0TX,,hybrid,,,2022/11/20,WOS:000775717400001,0

Our study aims to determine how and where young people can be reached with news. It uses a mixed methods approach to analyze the expectations of young people towards news content and formats and to determine their news consumption patterns. The results show that young people's news consumption is characterized by four dimensions: 1. duration and times of consumption, 2. news consumption habits and behavior, 3. restrictions, 4. media literacy. The significance of these dimensions varies between three age groups determined through the study. The news consumption of the 12-to-14 year-olds is strongly restricted by parents and school. This group consumes news mainly through media available at home. In the group of 15- to-17 year-olds, parental influence and restrictions decrease, while peer influence increases. This age group spends a lot of time on social media platforms where young people stumble upon news rather accidentally. Between 18 and 20 years of age, news consumption stabilizes, and individual patterns emerge. This age group accesses news via selected apps and social media channels. Young people in Switzerland prefer visual formats like pictures, videos, and memes. When scrolling through social media platforms, they come across news content which arouses their interest in certain information and leads them to search for it on media websites.

The findings show that both platforms attach significance to the substantive attributes of policing, violence, and systemic racism. Notably, while the newspapers' overall agenda had a supportive tone, Twitter used a condemning tone. Moreover, the newspapers were more influential in terms of IAS, particularly in setting political and cultural attribute agendas. No IAS effects were found on the affective attributes. Furthermore, the IAS effects on the combined substantive and affective attributes have shrunk significantly. The newspapers were more influential in terms of the bundled substantive attribute agendas as well.

Though arguably beneficial to journalism, the family newspaper as an archetype has frequently been used to perpetuate certain journalistic myths. This includes myths about commercial journalism's ability to meaningfully prioritize public interest. To understand the ways the family newspaper archetype functions in public discourse, this study examines a moment of upheaval, in which the cultural construct is both upheld and contested. Focusing on a tumultuous period at a metropolitan newspaper, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, the analysis finds that the archetype's proximity to an imagined past influences its rhetorical force and appeal.

By documenting the risks and stresses workers of all classes faced during the first year of the pandemic, the reporting began to question neoliberal capitalism as socially unsustainable. Drawing on a corpus of 151 long-form articles and commentary, we show how journalistic discourse structured relationships between different classes of workers and implicated institutions for failing to properly mitigate the risks associated with COVID-19, even though the discourse largely centered on professionals working from home. As the reporting substantiated the precarities revealed by the pandemic as social facts, it challenged presumptions that undergird neoliberal ideologies, though it remains to be seen whether journalism will discursively re-center neoliberal logics in the wake of the pandemic.","[Creech, Brian] Temple Univ, Lew Klein Coll Media & Commun, Dept Journalism, 2020 N 13th St, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA; [Maddox, Jessica] Univ Alabama, Dept Journalism & Creat Media, Tuscaloosa, AL USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University; University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa,"Creech, B (corresponding author), Temple Univ, Lew Klein Coll Media & Commun, Dept Journalism, 2020 N 13th St, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA.",tuf31190@temple.edu,"Creech, Brian/AAR-8116-2021","Creech, Brian/0000-0002-0986-6842",,,,,91,0,0,0,1,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,,,,,,,,,,,1.46E+16,10.1177/14648849211073450,0.0,,Jan-22,19,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,ZL3KF,,Green Published,,,2022/11/20,WOS:000763576100001,0

Yet, so far, the effects of subtle (positive/negative) visual background cues on candidate evaluation remain largely unclear. Also, the role of individuals' media trust has not been explored in this context. That is, trusting individuals may interpret subtle visual cues in different ways compared with mistrusting individuals. Drawing from theory on visual communication, media trust, and the persuasion knowledge model a quota-based online experiment revealed that media trust moderates the relationship between the exposure to negative visual cues and candidate evaluation in the context of a political scandal. Mistrusting individuals showed more positive candidate evaluations, whereas trusting individuals showed more negative evaluations. Thus, visual background cues can have a polarising effect on citizens' evaluations of political actors and influence the electorate in very different ways.

However, studies find that news coverage typically fails to contextualise these crimes, relies on non-expert sources, and often engages in victim-blaming. Existing studies have primarily investigated print media. The lack of attention to broadcast media is significant because broadcast news attracts a larger share of public attention and it relies on distinct routines and practices that may influence coverage. To address this gap, this study presents an in-depth analysis of the broadcast news coverage surrounding a 2016 case of familicide-suicide in Ireland. Our analysis identifies patterns of decontextualisation, non-expert sourcing and perpetrator exoneration. Specifically, coverage decontextualised the crime through an emphasis on the family and the response of the community and through the privileging of (male) local sources, including male religious voices, over expert sources. Although victim-blaming was not very explicit, coverage frequently exonerated the perpetrator through references to his good character. Thus, we find that broadcast news replicates the patterns of print news and that the preference for on-the ground reporting privileged sources who were proximate to the crime rather than those who could provide an expert understanding of it. These findings are discussed in terms of efforts to change media practices for more accurate representations of IPH and familicide in news media.","[O'Brien, Anne] Maynooth Univ, Dept Media Studies, Iontas Bldg, Maynooth, Kildare, Ireland; [Culloty, Eileen] Dublin City Univ, Inst Future Media & Journalism, Dublin, Ireland",Maynooth University; Dublin City University,"O'Brien, A (corresponding author), Maynooth Univ, Dept Media Studies, Iontas Bldg, Maynooth, Kildare, Ireland.",Anne.obrien@mu.ie,,"Culloty, Eileen/0000-0001-7960-8462",Community Foundation for Ireland,Community Foundation for Ireland,"The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Community Foundation for Ireland.",,49,2,2,1,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,MAY,2022.0,23.0,5,,,,,1010.0,1026.0,1.46488E+15,10.1177/1464884920978028,0.0,,Dec-20,17,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,0R6XK,,Green Accepted,,,2022/11/20,WOS:000601233500001,0

Findings reveal that studies dealing with these concepts are on the rise in absolute numbers, but also that their theoretical foundations predominantly still lie in the 1990s. From the viewpoint that said foundations have become inadequate to study and understand news diversity in the digital era, we propose an integrated conceptual framework, model and definition to operationalise news diversity, which takes into consideration recent changes in journalism as media concentration dynamics and changing patterns in news production and consumption. It does so by developing a typology of five categories of diversity (ownership, brand, production, content, consumption) and presenting three levels from which news diversity can be studied (the macro level of the media market, the meso level of the media company and the micro level of the media brand). Ultimately, the paper proposes the adoption of mixed methods research to reveal more about the characteristics, contexts and constraints within any media market.","[Hendrickx, Jonathan; Balton, Pieter; Ranaivoson, Heritiana] Vrije Univ Brussel, Imec SMIT, 9 Pleinlaan, B-1040 Brussels, Belgium",Vrije Universiteit Brussel,"Hendrickx, J (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Brussel, Imec SMIT, 9 Pleinlaan, B-1040 Brussels, Belgium.",Jonathan.hendrickx@vub.be,,"Ranaivoson, Heritiana/0000-0002-3909-0440; Ballon, Pieter/0000-0001-6066-3242",Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek [S008817N],Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek(FWO),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek [Grant number S008817N].",,58,10,10,0,11,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,AUG,2022.0,23.0,8,,,,,1751.0,1769.0,1.46488E+15,10.1177/1464884920966881,0.0,,Oct-20,19,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,3V8NI,,,,,2022/11/20,WOS:000581020800001,0

That said, journalism outside the liberal West may operate within vastly different contexts, shaped by different historical experiences, political cultures, and philosophical traditions, thereby creating a different brand of data journalism. This paper examines data journalism practice in Asia specifically, a region known to be home to collaborative press systems that adhere to a set of Asian values pertaining to collectivism, social harmony, norm conformity and deference to authority. By examining 210 data stories produced by news outlets in six Asian countries, this study finds that Asian values are displayed in a vast majority of data stories produced in the region, most of which are news stories pertaining to the home country of these news outlets. Continued reliance on government sources for information and a lack of stories that reveal previously hidden information or scrutinize a powerful entity also suggest no strong push to leverage on the investigative qualities of data journalism to produce more watchdog journalism; focus is instead placed on the civic role of informing the public.","[Wu, Shangyuan] Natl Univ Singapore, Fac Arts & Social Sci, Dept Commun & New Media, AS6,11 Comp Dr, Singapore 117416, Singapore",National University of Singapore,"Wu, SY (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, Fac Arts & Social Sci, Dept Commun & New Media, AS6,11 Comp Dr, Singapore 117416, Singapore.",shanwu@nus.edu.sg,,,Ministry of Education Academic Research Fund Tier 1 in Singapore [FY2019-FRC3-011],"Ministry of Education Academic Research Fund Tier 1 in Singapore(Ministry of Education, Singapore)","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The work was funded by the Ministry of Education Academic Research Fund Tier 1 in Singapore (FY2019-FRC3-011).",,56,0,0,8,8,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1177/14648849221133298,0.0,,Oct-22,18,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,5G9NQ,,,,,2022/11/20,WOS:000867317100001,0

To revitalize this idea, a focus upon how journalists handle silence professionally is suggested. It is argued that it is important to bring out how the handling of silence is carried out, and to understand that silence is not only something to be avoided. Silence is of foundational importance for communicative significance to emerge. In a reading of Deleuze, Heidegger and Derrida, we argue for a model in which silence is necessary for significant communicative exchanges. We avoid thoughtlessness by allotting a function to silence; for communication requires not just information but a channel of silence, so to speak. It is, finally, argued that it is important not to expect the revealed forms of silence to be problematic. It is demonstrated that certain forms of silence can be analysed as democracy enhancing because they permit less heated exchanges that make room for thoughtful contemplation.","[Hansen, Ejvind] Danish Sch Media & Journalism, Journalism & Publ Sphere, Helsingforsgade 6A-D, DK-8200 Aarhus N, Denmark",,"Hansen, E (corresponding author), Danish Sch Media & Journalism, Journalism & Publ Sphere, Helsingforsgade 6A-D, DK-8200 Aarhus N, Denmark.",philosophy@ejvindh.net,,,,,,,49,0,0,2,2,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1177/14648849221132601,0.0,,Oct-22,17,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,5D4BF,,,,,2022/11/20,WOS:000864888700001,0

Results show that people at lower social positions, measured as their relative lack of cultural and economic capital, are significantly more likely to avoid online news. A lack of cultural capital predicts total news avoidance online, avoiding online public service news and the quality news, while it lessens the likelihood of avoiding popular news online. Lacking economic capital predicts total news avoidance online and avoiding the popular news. We conclude the article with three cultural sociological lessons for the study of news avoidance.

Through personal interviews with media owners and others in Manila, this empirical research provides insights into the challenges facing the contemporary Philippines media, in particular those media elites whose companies criticise his administration. While Duterte - like most populists - claims to be challenging powerful 'oligarchs', in reality his administration has cracked down severely against some media elites and has nurtured coercive relationships with others.

TheNew York Timesis regarded as one of the news organizations that practices quality journalism, yet it also faces the pressure of market-driven journalism that focuses more on financial interests than the public interest. News organizations, popular as well as quality newspapers, have become unprecedentedly competitive in the new media context, pressured to increase audience attention, possibly influencing quality papers to emphasize the pragmatic function of attracting audiences by employing more sensational headlines. A content analysis of 749 news articles, which compared 10 newspapers in South Korea with theNew York Timesin the United States, showed that newspapers in South Korea more frequently employed headlines that highlighted the pragmatic function. Specifically, this study operationalized the semantic function to include headlines with factual information - that is, Who, When, Where, What, Why, and How - while the pragmatic function measured the extent to which headlines included four attracting devices - metaphors, adverbs, direct quotations, and questions. Findings of this study showed that only 4.9 percent of the headlines included more than four items of factual information among the Who, When, Where, What, Why, and How, whereas 74.9 percent of the headlines included more than one attracting device.

This article looks closely at one thing that makes the job of cultural journalists, in particular critics, distinct from other journalistic beats - the openly acknowledged importance of emotionality and subjectivity in these media workers' professional practices - and explores the role of emotions in dealing with the crisis in the profession. Based on 14 semi-structured interviews with film and food critics, this article addresses the following questions: What emotional labour do the cultural critics perform? How does professional cultural criticism legitimize itself in the digital era? I suggest that both the film and food critics cherish the fact that their work processes draw heavily on their subjectivity: emotional experiences, political opinions and personal memories. However, to be able do their job, the critics cannot allow such elements of subjectivity to take the reins, and therefore, they perform emotional labour for the successful objectivization of their emotionality: making use of their emotions to better recognize what moments or aspects are significant for the assessment of the quality of the cultural object being reviewed. Furthermore, I suggest that in the context where digitalization has threatened the exceptional position of the professional cultural critic, emotional labour together with some other strategies of handling one's subjectivity can help them to construct boundaries of professional cultural criticism and thus to reclaim professional legitimacy.","[Kotisova, Johana] Masaryk Univ, Fac Social Studies, Dept Media Studies & Journalism, Jostova 10, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Kotisova, J (corresponding author), Masaryk Univ, Fac Social Studies, Dept Media Studies & Journalism, Jostova 10, Brno 60200, Czech Republic.",j.kotisova@gmail.com,,,Czech Science Foundation [GA18-18532S],Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),"The author disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study was supported by the Czech Science Foundation project Qualitative Research on the Semantics of Aesthetic Judgements (GA18-18532S).",,43,7,7,0,14,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,APR,2022.0,23.0,4,,,,,789.0,805.0,1.46488E+15,10.1177/1464884920917289,0.0,,Apr-20,17,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,0M3LB,,,,,2022/11/20,WOS:000532752900001,0

The study found that SoHo did not openly cover racial-structural inequalities, did not contextualize racism, omitted the voices of people of African descent, neglected the race of Black leaders, evaded controversial language, disregarded racial polarization, and presented Black people as disempowered individuals while championing non-Blacks as agents of change. Although SoHo is not a peace journalism project, the magazine's coverage of blackness revealed that avoiding incendiary language - a key tenet of peace journalism - may in fact maintain power dynamics between oppressors and oppressed, as misunderstanding interaction with collaboration does.","[Cortes-Martinez, Carlos A.] Univ La Sabana, Cundinamarca, Colombia; [Thomas, Ryan J.] Univ Missouri, Columbia, MO 65211 USA",Universidad de La Sabana; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia,"Cortes-Martinez, CA (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Javeriana, Sch Commun & Language, Bogota, Colombia.",carloscortes@javeriana.edu.co,"CortÃ©s-MartÃ­nez, Carlos A./AAQ-5098-2020","CortÃ©s-MartÃ­nez, Carlos A./0000-0003-0336-2827",,,,,62,2,2,0,7,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,JAN,2022.0,23.0,1,,,,,189.0,206.0,1.46488E+15,10.1177/1464884920908117,0.0,,Mar-20,18,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,XW1QR,,,,,2022/11/20,WOS:000523771900001,0

Based on 20 in-depth interviews with diverse news audiences in Serbia, we explored how media distrust and cynicism can be empirically distinguished. While both perceptions entail negative expectations from journalism, our findings indicate that they diverge with respect to interviewees' views on journalistic ideals and integrity, differentiation between media actors, and receptivity to journalistic performance. In the interviews, cynicism emerged as the deterministic and process-oriented perception that journalism serves no other purposes than financial profit and audience manipulation. In contrast, distrust was a more nuanced, probing, and outcome-oriented perception that may be open to correction in the presence of counter-evidence. These findings can help media researchers and educators to better diagnose and address negative media perceptions.","[Markov, Cedomir; Min, Young] Korea Univ, Sch Media & Commun, Seoul, South Korea; [Markov, Cedomir] Univ Belgrade, Inst Philosophy & Social Theory, Kraljice Natalije 45, Belgrade 11000, Serbia",Korea University; University of Belgrade,"Markov, C (corresponding author), Univ Belgrade, Inst Philosophy & Social Theory, Kraljice Natalije 45, Belgrade 11000, Serbia.",cedomir.markov@instifdt.bg.ac.rs,"Markov, Äedomir/GWC-8397-2022","Markov, Cedomir/0000-0001-8575-3244",,,,,56,0,0,2,2,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1177/14648849221122064,0.0,,Aug-22,19,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,3U4II,,,,,2022/11/20,WOS:000840935900001,0

As material forms of recognition, journalism awards decisively contribute to accumulated journalistic capital and work as an instrument of cultural hierarchy within the field. However, despite the growth in journalistic prizes and the added importance of recognition in times of crisis, we still have an incomplete understanding of how journalists themselves assess the meaning of awards for their position in the field. In this study, we therefore focus on journalists' evaluations of awards. Drawing on 40 semi-structured interviews with young awarded journalists we explore the meaning of prizes to better understand the relationship between recognition and capital. Our results indicate that from the perspective of awarded journalists receiving an award does not automatically contribute to prestige and hence the accumulation of journalistic capital. Instead, our study suggests that journalists consider prizes to be an ambiguous and ambivalent form of recognition. Whether an award is considered prestigious depends on aspects such as its scarcity, its sponsors, the composition of juries, the visibility of the award in the industry as well as the genre and category that is awarded.","[Noelleke, Daniel] German Sport Univ Cologne, Cologne, Germany; [Hanusch, Folker; Maares, Phoebe] Univ Vienna, Dept Commun, Vienna, Austria",German Sport University Cologne; University of Vienna,"Nolleke, D (corresponding author), German Sport Univ Cologne, Inst Commun & Media Res, Sportpark Mungersdorf 6, D-50933 Cologne, Germany.",d.noelleke@dshs-koeln.de,,"Hanusch, Folker/0000-0002-7344-0483; Nolleke, Daniel/0000-0002-3494-3897; Maares, Phoebe/0000-0002-9518-7132",,,,,44,1,1,2,2,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,,,,,,,,,,,1.46E+16,10.1177/14648849221109657,0.0,,Jun-22,18,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,2F7ZU,,,,,2022/11/20,WOS:000813124900001,0

Combining manual coding (n = 1095) with rule-based text classification (N = 9922), the media delegitimization to which transsexual people are subjected has been analyzed using logistic regression and multilevel analysis. The results confirm that the newsworthiness of transsexuality in Spain has increased significantly over the first two decades of the 21st century. They also indicate that the media delegitimization of transsexuality has been significantly reduced. These findings suggest a remarkable evolution in the news media coverage of transsexuality.

This understanding has been incredibly productive for scholars, but it elides an important question. How do news practices actually get into reporters' heads? The lack of answers to this question has created a persistent gap between the study of news practices and examination of reporters' actions. In this essay, I build on recent advances in cognitive cultural sociology, especially the dual-process theory of social cognition, to offer an account of how reporters internalize culture. I argue that this account is especially helpful for analysis of situations in which what journalists can say about what they do is only loosely associated with what they do, or know how to do. In my estimation, such situations are increasingly common in journalism. A clearer understanding of processes of internalization will lead to more accurate assessments of reporters' actions, especially in situations in which their words and their deeds are not aligned.","[Ryfe, David M.] Univ Iowa, Sch Journalism & Mass Commun, 100 Adler Journalism Bldg, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA",University of Iowa,"Ryfe, DM (corresponding author), Univ Iowa, Sch Journalism & Mass Commun, 100 Adler Journalism Bldg, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.",david-ryfe@uiowa.edu,,,,,,,83,0,0,3,3,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,,,,,,,,,,,1.46E+16,10.1177/14648849221074420,0.0,,Jan-22,17,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,ZL3KQ,,,,,2022/11/20,WOS:000763577200001,0

A manual content analysis of print, online, and television news demonstrates that a larger total number of news factors in a story positively predict an item's length and likelihood of front-page publication or likelihood of being a newscast's opening item. News factors 'conflict' and 'eliteness' have the strongest impact, mixed evidence was found for 'proximity' and 'personification', whereas relationships with 'negativity', 'influence and relevance', and 'continuity' were mostly insignificant. Fewer differences than expected emerged between outlet types (popular vs quality press).

This period of high emotion for Americans provides a case study in audience members' sometimes hostile relationship with journalists and does so at an early moment in the creation of a truly mass national news audience.

The study is based on ethnographic observations and interviews (N = 30) from three Western-based news organisations, each representing a link in the complex international news-image circulation process. Further, the organisations form an example of a chain of filters through which most of the news images produced for the global market have to pass before publication. These filters are scrutinised by the empirical case studies that examine the professionals' ethical reasoning regarding images of violence and death. This research contributes to an understanding of the differences and similarities between media organisations as filters and sheds light on their role in shaping visual coverage. This study concludes that photojournalism professionals' ethical decision-making is discursively constructed around three frames: (1) shared ethics, (2) relative ethics and (3) distributed ethics. All the organisations share certain similar conceptions of journalism ethics at the level of ideals. On the level of workplace practices and routines, a mixture of practical preconditions, journalism's self-regulation, business logic and national legislation lead to differences in the image selection practices. It is argued that the ethical decision-making is distributed between - and sometimes even outsourced to - colleagues working in different parts of the filtering chain. Finally, this study suggests that dead or suffering bodies are often invisible in the images of the studied media organisations.","[Maenpaa, Jenni] Univ Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland",University of Helsinki,"Maenpaa, J (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Fac Social Sci, Media & Commun Studies, Unioninkatu 37,POB 54, Helsinki 00014, Finland.",jenni.k.maenpaa@helsinki.fi,,"Maenpaa, Jenni/0000-0001-7771-7833",Kone Foundation; Academy of Finland [325160],Kone Foundation; Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland),"The author disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study is funded by post-doctoral grants from the Kone Foundation and the Academy of Finland 325160.",,41,1,1,5,10,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,OCT,2022.0,23.0,10,,,,,2230.0,2248.0,1.46488E+15,10.1177/1464884921996308,0.0,,Feb-21,19,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,4Z0TO,,hybrid,,,2022/11/20,WOS:000620762900001,0

Through the lenses of First Amendment theory and political economy, the analysis examines a range of ideas and proposals that, in many ways, began with Robert W.

The paper concludes that, while a 'positive' interpretation of the First Amendment would seem to demand such intervention, the window of opportunity has closed due to a range of political and economic forces that have either developed or become further entrenched over the past decade. To that end, it calls on journalists and journalism scholars to work to shift the discourse of journalism, to characterise it as an essential, nonpartisan public good - one no different than education. It argues that such a shift, along with enough evidence of further market failure, could someday help inspire the necessary political and economic will to help rescue the floundering news industry on a wider scale.","[Walters, Patrick] Kutztown State Univ, 263 Lytle Hall,POB 730, Kutztown, PA 19530 USA",Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education (PASSHE); Kutztown University - Pennsylvania,"Walters, P (corresponding author), Kutztown State Univ, 263 Lytle Hall,POB 730, Kutztown, PA 19530 USA.",pwalters@kutztown.edu,,,,,,,57,3,3,0,11,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,AUG,2022.0,23.0,8,,,,,1645.0,1662.0,1.46488E+15,10.1177/1464884920982404,0.0,,Dec-20,18,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,3V8NI,,,,,2022/11/20,WOS:000601231400001,0

We conducted 15 interviews with journalists and editors who covered the event on site or direct from the newsroom. Our results indicate that the main factors that interfered and structured the journalists conditions of production and routines during the coverage of the 2016 Rio PG were: some business issues (prioritization of audience interests and the exclusivity of broadcasting rights); some logistical issues (limitation of coverage to contents that could be accessed from the newsroom; accessibility barriers for journalists with disabilities; transportation between arenas, and reduced teams of journalists); and journalists' level preparedness to cover the event. The interviews also revealed that the main news criteria for content selection were expected victories and medals, proximity, and curiosity. They said they emphasized content that valued athletes' sportsmanship and narratives of overcoming adversity.","[Santos, Silvan Menezes dos] Univ Fed Mato Grosso do Sul, UFMS, Campo Grande, MS, Brazil; [Solves, Josep] CEU Univ, Univ Cardenal Herrera CEU, Alfara Del Patriarca, Spain; [Souza, Doralice Lange de] Univ Fed Parana, UFPR, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso do Sul; Universidad CEU Cardenal Herrera; Universidade Federal do Parana,"dos Santos, SM (corresponding author), Univ Fed Mato Grosso do Sul, Rua Jamil Basmage 1860, BR-79033480 Campo Grande, MS, Brazil.",silvan.menezes@ufms.br,"SOLVES, JOSEP/S-7995-2019",,Fundacao Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso do Sul - UFMS/MEC - Brazil; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior - Brasil (CAPES) [001],Fundacao Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso do Sul - UFMS/MEC - Brazil; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior - Brasil (CAPES)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study was supported in part by the Fundacao Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso do Sul - UFMS/MEC - Brazil.

Within this distinction, lifestyle journalism has been subordinated as occupying a marginal or peripheral position in the field. Yet, how journalists perceive this distinction has rarely been studied empirically. This study draws on concepts of 'boundary work' and 'othering' to examine how political and lifestyle journalists discursively reinforce and contest boundaries and hierarchies. Through semi-structured interviews with 22 lifestyle and 26 political journalists and editors in South Africa, we show that political and lifestyle journalists engaged in both intra-field (self-)expansion, and (self-)expulsion and (self-)othering, by evoking several boundary markers. Boundaries were reinforced through gendered discourses, autonomy ideals, claims to specialization and accessibility in news beats and presentation, beliefs about political journalism's preservation of humanity, and greater risks to safety of political journalists. Boundaries were challenged by politicizing lifestyle journalism and popularizing political journalism, providing a counter-narrative to political journalism's negativity, and treating lifestyle journalism as economically beneficial.","[Banjac, Sandra] Univ Groningen, Ctr Media & Journalism Studies, Oude Kijk Jatstr 26, NL-9712 EK Groningen, Netherlands; [Hanusch, Folker] Univ Vienna, Dept Commun, Vienna, Austria",University of Groningen; University of Vienna,"Banjac, S (corresponding author), Univ Groningen, Ctr Media & Journalism Studies, Oude Kijk Jatstr 26, NL-9712 EK Groningen, Netherlands.",s.banjac@rug.nl,,"Banjac, Sandra/0000-0001-5860-1675; Hanusch, Folker/0000-0002-7344-0483","Kurzfristige wissenschaftliche Auslandstipendien; Foerderungsstipendien, Department of Communication Research Award, University of Vienna","Kurzfristige wissenschaftliche Auslandstipendien; Foerderungsstipendien, Department of Communication Research Award, University of Vienna","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by Foerderungsstipendien, Department of Communication Research Award, University of Vienna and Kurzfristige wissenschaftliche Auslandstipendien.",,60,0,0,2,2,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1177/14648849221125702,0.0,,Sep-22,19,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,4S9XX,,hybrid,,,2022/11/20,WOS:000857785200001,0

In this paper, we argue that this assumption overlooks the importance of structural- and individual-level factors in shaping news audience behavior. Drawing on Giddens' theory of structuration, we suggest that, when it comes to the amount of time that people devote to news, consumers' choices are guided more by life circumstances than by news preferences. To illustrate this point, we draw on a combination of interview and audience analytics data collected when so many people's life circumstances changed: the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. We find that people consumed more news during the early months of the pandemic than normal because (1) they had more time on their hands due to things like shelter-in-place orders, layoffs, and shifts to working from home and (2) they were more interested in understanding the coronavirus' spread and risks as well as the preventative measures being pursued. We conclude that journalists should embrace journalistic humility, thereby acknowledging and accepting that they have much less control over the reception of their work than they would like to believe.","[Nelson, Jacob L.] Arizona State Univ, Walter Cronkite Sch Journalism & Mass Commun, Phoenix, AZ 85004 USA; [Lewis, Seth C.] Univ Oregon, Sch Journalism & Commun, Eugene, OR 97403 USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Downtown Phoenix; University of Oregon,"Nelson, JL (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Walter Cronkite Sch Journalism & Mass Commun, Phoenix, AZ 85004 USA.",jacob.nelson.1@asu.edu,,"Lewis, Seth/0000-0001-7498-0599",,,,,39,1,1,7,7,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,,,,,,,,,,,1.46E+16,10.1177/14648849221095335,0.0,,May-22,18,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,1L6ER,,Green Published,,,2022/11/20,WOS:000799379800001,0

Many studies have addressed this phenomenon using different textual and discursive approaches, including critical discourse analysis. However, these studies have mostly tackled the ideological manipulation in news translation as an end-product, and the process-particularly from a sociological perspective, including the interactions among human and non-human actants within their networks in news agencies-has remained largely under-researched. The present study is an attempt to shed light on this less-researched part of the phenomenon and analyze the actants and their interactions in political news translation in the Iranian news agencies in light of Actor-Network Theory and Critical Discourse Analysis. The data are gathered through in-depth interviews as well as observation of practices in newsrooms. The results reveal that the manipulation process consists of different stages, each of which involves human and non-human actants, forming a complicated hierarchical but circular network. The ideological manipulation is practiced in line with the socio-political requirements of the Iranian context which directly or indirectly influences the involved actants.","[Daghigh, Ali Jalalian] Univ Malaya, Fac Languages & Linguist, Dept English Language, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia",Universiti Malaya,"Daghigh, AJ (corresponding author), Univ Malaya, Fac Languages & Linguist, Dept English Language, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia.",Jalalian@um.edu.my,"Daghigh, Ali Jalalian/HCH-2110-2022","Daghigh, Ali Jalalian/0000-0001-7418-7048",,,,,50,0,0,12,21,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,JUL,2022.0,23.0,7,,,SI,,1530.0,1547.0,1.46E+16,10.1177/14648849221074493,0.0,,Feb-22,18,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,2E6BM,,,,,2022/11/20,WOS:000763575800001,0

However, specifying such changes in relation to news audiences and engagement is challenging. This article aims to unfold the complexity of consumption to specify different processes of changing news use. Employing an abductive approach that augments existing literature with a study on the processes and catalysts of transformation, we develop a heuristic framework to explicate changing news repertoires. The framework establishes where change takes place, explores what qualities change has, examines what dynamic factors drive change, and ultimately elaborates a more precise vocabulary to identify different change processes. Further specifying and modeling the exploration and elaboration phases, the article details how deliberateness, permanence, and scale vary the intensity and direction of change, before developing a typology that systematizes different analytical characteristics of how news media become part of (emergence), exist within (maintenance), and are removed from (disappearance) an individual's media repertoire. The article provides a detailed, systematic, and innovative approach to analyze news use, providing scholars with a comprehensive, actionable framework for qualitative, quantitative, and mixed-methods research to better understand what, exactly, repertoire change is. In terms of applicability, the theoretical perspective developed alerts us to the fact that changing news use is often conceptualized by audiences in association with non-journalistic, contextual considerations, which are key to whether or not the potential for changing news use is actualized.","[Vulpius, Julie; Lehaff, Josephine] Roskilde Univ, Dept Commun & Arts, Roskilde, Denmark; [Schroder, Kim Christian] Roskilde Univ, Commun, Roskilde, Denmark; [Peters, Chris] Roskilde Univ, Ctr Digital Citizenship, Roskilde, Denmark",Roskilde University; Roskilde University; Roskilde University,"Vulpius, J (corresponding author), Roskilde Univ, Dept Commun & Arts, Roskilde, Denmark.;Vulpius, J (corresponding author), Roskilde Univ, Commun & Arts, Univ Vej 1,Bygning 40, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark.",Julievg@ruc.dk,"Vulpius, Julie/DJA-8363-2022","Schroder, Kim Christian/0000-0002-5437-4249; Vulpius, Julie/0000-0002-2118-2945; Peters, Chris/0000-0002-5813-1674",Independent Research Fund Denmark,Independent Research Fund Denmark,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by Det Frie Forskningsr degrees ad.

Focussing on two central aspects of epistemology, epistemic value and epistemic practices, we ask two overall questions (1) How are audience metrics balanced and reconciled in relation to other standards in the justification of news as valuable knowledge? How are different practices of research and presentation, truth-seeking and truth-telling, prioritized in a news organization marked as a data-driven news work culture? The study presents a case study of a Scandinavian legacy news publisher that has pursued the embracing of a data-driven news work culture. It is based on a qualitative multi-method approach. The findings show how metrics are used as a superior standard in deciding on the epistemic value of news. This is expressed in strategies, guidelines and discussions in the newsroom, and put into practice in coaching, evaluations and rewarding of the performance of individual journalists. In the everyday news production, metrics are reconciled in relation to independent standards in journalism, related to the claims of news journalism to provide relevant and verified public knowledge about current events. Moreover, the study shows how the embracement of metrics radicalizes the focus on presentation, packaging and timing in the optimization of news material and in the valuing of professional practices. Efforts in research and truth seeking are more seldom explicitly valued. The work of fulfilling reasonable truth claims is mainly taken for granted.","[Ekstrom, Mats; Ramsalv, Amanda] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Journalism Media & Commun, Box 100 SE, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Westlund, Oscar] Oslo Metropolitan Univ, Oslo, Norway; [Westlund, Oscar] Oslo Metropolitan Univ, OsloMet Digital Journalism Res Grp, Oslo, Norway",University of Gothenburg; Oslo Metropolitan University (OsloMet); Oslo Metropolitan University (OsloMet),"Ekstrom, M (corresponding author), Univ Gothenburg, Dept Journalism Media & Commun, Box 100 SE, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden.",mats.ekstrom@jmg.gu.se,,,Riksbankens Jubileumsfond,Riksbankens Jubileumsfond,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by Riksbankens Jubileumsfond.",,32,2,2,5,10,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,APR,2022.0,23.0,4,,,,,755.0,772.0,1.46E+16,10.1177/14648849211052419,0.0,,Dec-21,18,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,0M3LB,,"hybrid, Green Published",,,2022/11/20,WOS:000736655700001,0

So far, studies often attempt either to define what infotainment is, how the technological and economic changes have given rise to the format, or what effects it exerts, but rarely consider all three aspects together. This raises the possibility that the properties of infotaining formats are under-defined, leading to a confusion about the effects from infotaining content. This article explores (1) where infotainment comes from, (2) what its constitutive properties are, and (3) why its potential cultivation effect should differ from other formats. From synthesizing these notions, an integrated model derives that combines insights from journalism studies and cultivation theory in order to explain how the technological and economic forces shape the infotaining content being produced, and its cultivating effects on the public further.

Journalism historians have linked the rise of interpretive reporting to the use of bylines, globalism, syndicated columns, and specialized journalism education. The dean of the Washington press corps, Oulahan earned his first bylined story in 1918 for coverage of the Paris Peace Conference. After that time, he began receiving bylines for his coverage of government, politics, and international affairs. Thus, Oulahan's bylined reporting offers an access point for studying the post-World War I rise of interpretive reporting at The New York Times. The study examines the concept of interpretive reporting and then focuses on The New York Times, particularly the influence of Oulahan, Lester Markel, and Arthur Sulzberger. The study shows a direct link between Oulahan's authoritative voice and the editorial innovations pioneered by Sunday Times editor Markel, one of the foremost advocates of interpretive reporting.

Native advertising (i.e., sponsored articles) is considered an escape from this dilemma. In adapting to journalistic content, this advertising format is distinct from conventional online advertising and allows advertisers to convey persuasive messages in an unobtrusive manner. However, despite its financial benefits, there are ethical concerns about native advertising, which is inherently and intentionally deceptive to its audience. Moreover, native advertising perforates the normative wall separating journalistic responsibilities from advertisers' interests. In news organizations, this is reflected in the relationship between journalists and advertising sales managers. The present study therefore explored how individuals in these two roles differ in their perceptions of risks and opportunities related to native advertising and in how they cope with ethical concerns. Exploring the power relations between journalists and sales managers in collaborations on native advertising, this study also sheds light on potential restrictions of journalistic autonomy caused by native advertising.","[Beckert, Johannes] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Mainz, Germany",Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz,"Beckert, J (corresponding author), Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Dept Commun, Jakob Welder Weg 12, D-55099 Mainz, Germany.",johannes.beckert@uni-mainz.de,,"Beckert, Johannes/0000-0003-1418-0818",,,,,46,0,0,12,17,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,,,,,,,,,,,1.46E+16,10.1177/14648849211067584,0.0,,Jan-22,19,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,YP7PJ,,,,,2022/11/20,WOS:000748813300001,0

However, I argue in this paper that the political potential of ordinary voice can only be realized in and through concrete instances of its use, and so needs to be examined within news texts as sites of micro-political struggle over meaning. Looking at Australian current affairs television coverage of so-called 'African gang' crime in Melbourne, this paper approaches crime news texts as sites of vulnerability politics, where different and sometimes competing claims to vulnerability encounter one another and struggle for public recognition. A close multi-modal analysis of three episodes of current affairs television uncovers four specific strategies of textual composition and presentation by which the criminalization of Black African youth is able to persist despite the testimonial interventions of the criminalized: appropriation, marginalization, subjugation and calculation. The paper concludes by considering the implications of this analysis for future studies of ordinary voice and citizen testimony in news reporting.","[Higgins, Kathryn Claire] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Media & Commun, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Higgins, KC (corresponding author), London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Media & Commun, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",k.c.higgins@lse.ac.uk,,"Higgins, Kathryn Claire/0000-0002-0234-8081",,,,,53,1,1,1,3,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,OCT,2022.0,23.0,10,,,,,2114.0,2131.0,1.46E+16,10.1177/14648849211001788,0.0,,Mar-21,18,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,4Z0TO,,"Green Accepted, hybrid",,,2022/11/20,WOS:000629711200001,0

Relying on the following three sources of original data: content analysis of media coverage (press comments over 8 weeks of 2014 and 2015), a cross-sectional survey (Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing), and survey and focus group interviewing on the reception of Internet memes; we show that a strategic narrative works both in the media and in the opinions of media recipients.

However, the key mediating role that translation plays when the news crosses linguistic and cultural borders has remained largely unexamined. This article considers how different translation strategies can maximise or minimise the potential journalism holds to facilitate cross-cultural engagement and approaches the still widely unexplored area of the reception of translated news. It relates existing debates in the discipline of translation studies to current approaches to the domestication of news in journalism research, paving the way for synergetic research across traditional disciplinary boundaries. The article explores how the news has the potential to equip readers with the cultural competence they need in a world that they share with others they do not understand, but only if journalistic translation practices promote rather than prevent engagement with the foreign cultural context. It discusses the findings of an exploratory focus-group study that compares the response of readers to news reporting translated according to the current norm for domesticating translation strategies with the response of readers to the same reports translated using an experimental 'foreignised' approach. The focus-group investigation, which takes Reuters' English-language reporting on news from France as a case study, finds indications that the foreignised approach, by exposing the reader to the foreign cultural specificity rather than domesticating the news information using terms available in the target culture and language, is successful in facilitating cross-cultural engagement.","[Bielsa, Esperanca] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain",Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Scammell, C (corresponding author), 3 Longstone View, Bodmin PL30 3FD, Cornwall, England.",clairescammell@hotmail.co.uk,,,"AHRC, of ICREA (Catalan Institution for Research and Advanced Studies); Spanish Ministry for Science and Innovation [PID2019-104755GB-I00]","AHRC, of ICREA (Catalan Institution for Research and Advanced Studies); Spanish Ministry for Science and Innovation(Spanish Government)","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The authors acknowledge the financial support of the AHRC, of ICREA (Catalan Institution for Research and Advanced Studies) and of the Spanish Ministry for Science and Innovation (grant number PID2019-104755GB-I00) for the production of this article.",,75,0,0,11,12,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,JUL,2022.0,23.0,7,,,SI,,1430.0,1448.0,1.46E+16,10.1177/14648849221074555,0.0,,Apr-22,19,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,2E6BM,,,,,2022/11/20,WOS:000780130300001,0

While the field of Journalism Studies has already engaged in rich debates on how to rethink the truth conditions of user-generated content (UGC) in platform journalism, we argue that it has missed out on the ethico-political function of UGC as testimonials of lives-at-risk. If we wish to recognize and act on UGC as techno-social practices of witnessing human pain and death, we propose, then we need to push further the conceptual and analytical boundaries of the field. In this paper, we do this by introducing a view of UGC as flesh witnessing, that is as embodied and mobile testimonies of vulnerable others that, enabled by smartphones, enter global news environments as appeals to attention and action. Drawing on examples from the Syrian conflict, we provide an analysis of the narrative strategies through which flesh witnessing acquires truth-telling authority and we reflect on what is gained and lost in the process. western story-telling, we conclude, strategically co-opts the affective dimension of flesh witnessing - its focus on child innocence, heroic martyrdom or the data aesthetics of destruction - and selectively minimizes its urgency by downplaying or effacing the bodies of non-western witnesses. This preoccupation with verification should not be subject to geopolitical formulations and needs to be combined with an explicit acknowledgement of the embodied voices of conflict as testimonies of the flesh whose often mortal vulnerability is, in fact, the very condition of possibility upon which western broadcasting rests.","[Chouliaraki, Lilie; Al-Ghazzi, Omar] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Media & Commun, Fawcett House 2,7th Floor,Room FAW2-7-01 D, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Chouliaraki, L (corresponding author), London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Media & Commun, Fawcett House 2,7th Floor,Room FAW2-7-01 D, London WC2A 2AE, England.",L.Chouliaraki@lse.ac.uk,,,,,,,44,0,0,8,12,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,MAR,2022.0,23.0,3,,,SI,,649.0,667.0,1.46E+16,10.1177/14648849211060628,0.0,,Dec-21,19,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,ZO6IV,,Green Accepted,,,2022/11/20,WOS:000731043300001,0

Respondents were asked about their preferences for reading and receiving local news, what their newspaper can do better, and the policy debates and interventions shaping the sector.

Findings suggest that both ideological incongruence and ad/PR work decreased journalistic autonomy, with the latter a stronger predictor than the former. Decreased autonomy, in turn, increased cynicism. Ad/PR work significantly predicted cynicism, but ideological incongruence did not influence cynicism. In addition, the more the news organization has adapted to the digital realm, the weaker the relations between ideological incongruence and autonomy and between autonomy and cynicism. However, as the adaptation level increased, the negative impact of ad/PR work on autonomy became stronger.

However, the existing literature has tended to focus on countries with relatively prosperous economies, neglecting to explore those with greater socio-economic inequality. Likewise, scholarship has offered some insight into what audiences expect of political journalists, but we know little about expectations of lifestyle journalism. Exploring role conceptions and expectations in socio-economically unequal societies gives rise to the question: How may social class shape these? To examine this, our study draws on 22 in-depth interviews with lifestyle journalists and three focus groups with audiences from different class backgrounds in South Africa. Findings suggest that lifestyle journalists' awareness of class disparity and the country's history of racial segregation and oppression shapes their roles in three ways. First, journalists expressed strong support for roles typically associated with political journalism, albeit interconnected with lifestyle roles. Second, journalists acted as 'responsible' cultural intermediaries, mediating the worlds of luxury and inequality. Third, journalists expressed a strong role orientation toward providing aspiration, as did audience expectations, indicating a level of congruence. Applying a Bourdieusian framework, we argue that lifestyle journalism allows audiences who live under 'conditions of scarcity' and who have been conceptualized as having a 'taste of necessity', to perform a 'taste of aspiration'. We suggest a need to reconceptualize scholarship's approach to studying journalistic roles by moving beyond a politics-lifestyle binary, and to more closely examine the role of aspiration in lifestyle journalism.","[Banjac, Sandra; Hanusch, Folker] Univ Vienna, Journalism Studies, Dept Commun, Vienna, Austria",University of Vienna,"Banjac, S (corresponding author), Univ Vienna, Dept Commun, Wahringer Str 29, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.",sandra.banjac@univie.ac.at,,"Banjac, Sandra/0000-0001-5860-1675; Hanusch, Folker/0000-0002-7344-0483",Kurzfristige wissenschaftliche Auslandstipendien (KWA); Department of Communication at the University of Vienna; Forderungsstipendien,Kurzfristige wissenschaftliche Auslandstipendien (KWA); Department of Communication at the University of Vienna; Forderungsstipendien,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was supported by funding from the Kurzfristige wissenschaftliche Auslandstipendien (KWA), Forderungsstipendien, and the Department of Communication at the University of Vienna.",,61,4,4,2,7,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,AUG,2022.0,23.0,8,,,,,1607.0,1625.0,1.46488E+15,10.1177/1464884920956823,0.0,,Sep-20,19,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,3V8NI,,hybrid,,,2022/11/20,WOS:000570371500001,0

Given the potential consequences of incivility in news spaces, it is essential to extend research on incivility perceptions to characteristics of digital news environments. We explore how the perception and availability of comment section features (i.e. comment moderation and anonymity), as well as a feeling of connection with a comment section community, relate to commenters and comment readers' incivility perceptions. By recruiting survey respondents from a population of individuals who read or post comments on one of 20 diverse news sites, we demonstrate that features of commenting spaces, and especially the feelings of connection formed in those spaces, relate to perceptions of incivility. We find that perceptions of comment section features relate to perceptions of incivility more so than the actual availability of these features. Our findings offer implications for newsrooms looking to foster perceptions of civility in comment sections and protect the value of their journalism.","[Van Duyn, Emily] Stanford Univ, Program Democracy & Internet, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Van Duyn, Emily] Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Muddiman, Ashley] Univ Kansas, Commun Studies Dept, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA",Stanford University; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; University of Kansas,"Van Duyn, E (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Program Democracy & Internet, 616 Serra Mall, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",vanduyn.emily@gmail.com,,"Van Duyn, Emily/0000-0003-3158-5884",Coral Project,Coral Project,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The authors would like to thank The Coral Project for funding this study.",,54,3,3,1,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,JAN,2022.0,23.0,1,,,,,134.0,152.0,1.46488E+15,10.1177/1464884920907779,0.0,,Apr-20,19,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,XW1QR,,,,,2022/11/20,WOS:000527535800001,0

However, in times of increasing international conflicts and polarisation, such as the years leading up to the Russia's war against Ukraine in 2022, migrant audiences find themselves in a situation when the coverage of national and international politics in the homeland and host country media can differ dramatically. Against this backdrop, this study investigated how Russian speakers living in Germany create and navigate their transnational news repertoires. Grounded in 42 semi-structured interviews with the Russian speakers of the 1 and 1.5 generations in Germany, conducted between May and October 2021, this article identifies three types of transnational news repertoires: (1) politically-motivated news repertoire, (2) truth seeking-motivated news repertoire and (3) situation-motivated news repertoire. The results show that all the news repertoires of all participants are transnational. I argue that in the context of international conflict, not only language but also the participants' political beliefs play an essential role in their news choice.

Additionally, the news may communicate gender to the audience in other ways beyond ascriptive characteristics of the reporter. We ask, do reporter gender, source gender, and gender of issues affect readers' engagements with news, attitudes toward news avoidance, or perceptions about gender bias in journalism? Results from a survey experiment show that newsroom diversity affects news-is-for-men perceptions. Upon reading a masculine-issue story, respondents-both men and women-were more willing to read and seek stories from the same news outlet. News stories from male reporters also caused a stronger belief that the newsroom was dominated by men, which boosted news-is-for-men perceptions.

Previous studies show it benefits journalists, newsrooms, and audiences (e.g. Coddington, Lewis & Holton, 2018). Conversely, journalists also experience harassment when interacting with audiences online, causing them to view audiences less favorably (Lewis, Zamith, & Coddington, 2020). Through in-depth interviews with 24 professional and former journalists, this study finds journalists experience cognitive dissonance after experiencing harassment during reciprocal journalism, but they are not likely to stop the practice due to organizational and individual benefits perceived as greater than the negatives. The study finds journalists feel personally responsible for resolving dissonance and often use unhealthy resolution techniques like normalization, victim blaming, or perspective-taking to deal with online abuse. The end result could mean dangerous consequences for individuals and the industry long-term.

We found that the higher exposure to Covid-19 misinformation, as promulgated in both active and passive social media uses, was related to informational mistrust that was also linked to a lower level of confidence in telling the veracity of misinformation. Findings also show the significant relationships between two forms of informal social ties and misinformation confidence.

Personal digital archives, we argue, reflect the migrant gaze and constitute mobile subaltern subjects' record of forced migration. Inductively learning from fieldwork conducted across five sites over 5 years, we analyse how the personal digital archive records and reflects the mediation of migration in its three dimensions: symbolic, affective and material. By focussing on personal digital archives, we recentre the authority of migrants as witnessing subjects of their own life stories. Their archives as autonomous migrant records provide a powerful basis to reflect upon and potentially contest mainstream western journalism cultures, which too often reduce migration to a spectacle and the migrant to a dehistoricised figure with little agency or voice.","[Georgiou, Myria] LSE, Dept Media & Commun, London, England; [Leurs, Koen] Univ Utrecht, Dept Media & Culture Studies, Utrecht, Netherlands",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Utrecht University,"Georgiou, M (corresponding author), LSE, Dept Media & Commun, London, England.",m.a.georgiou@lse.ac.uk; k.h.a.leurs@uu.nl,,"Leurs, Koen/0000-0003-4765-6464","National Research Agenda (NWA); Dutch Research Council (NWO) [275-45-007]; Rockefeller Foundation; Institute of Global Affairs, LSE","National Research Agenda (NWA); Dutch Research Council (NWO)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)); Rockefeller Foundation; Institute of Global Affairs, LSE","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Koen Leurs received financial supported for the research, authorship, and publication of this article, through the National Research Agenda (NWA) Start Impulse funded project Media literacy through making media: A key to participation for young newcomers?

There have been few scholarly inquiries examining how moral reasoning is deployed in media discourse around climate change. This study aims to address this gap with a comparative analysis of moral reasoning in news about climate change in leading national newspapers from three countries over a 6-year period. The findings suggest that while US and UK newspapers tended to frame climate change coverage as a domestic issue, Chinese media tended to frame it as a global issue that the world community needs to tackle. Moreover, US and UK newspapers often adopted the balanced reporting norm in communicating uncertainty and controversy, in contrast to the climate consensus that was firmly embedded in Chinese media discourse.

Extracting contents from Bloomberg Businessweek, Time and The Economist magazines for the years 2016-2018, the phenomenon was investigated using quantitative content analysis and qualitative textual analysis methods. The findings showed that MEA migrants are positively framed. However, the metaphors and language of constructing the image of these migrant groups belie the positive frames, making references to migrants' values, cultural backgrounds, faith, and origins in a way that dehumanises and capable of generating hostile attitudes towards them. Of the categories of sources used, politicians' voices and quotes dominated the coverage with references to the political actors of the 2016 epochal events, while the voices of MEA migrants are underrepresented. What these findings suggest is that not only did the 2016 Brexit and Trump immigration discourses influenced MEA migrants' portrayals, they also indicated that the media is still manufacturing consent with regards to immigration coverage.","[Okoye, John-Bell S.] Daystar Univ, Commun, Nairobi, Kenya",Daystar University,"Okoye, JBS (corresponding author), Daystar Univ, Dept Film & Media Studies, Sch Commun, POB 44400-00100, Nairobi, Kenya.",johnbell.okoye@gmail.com,,,,,,,79,0,0,0,10,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,OCT,2022.0,23.0,10,,,,,2153.0,2170.0,1.46488E+15,10.1177/1464884920984693,0.0,,Dec-20,18,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,4Z0TO,,,,,2022/11/20,WOS:000610286600001,0

An important question is how professional journalism can prevent the disillusion that a growing number of Millennials experience when consuming news. Constructive journalism is often propagated as a way to improve the well-being and engagement of readers. To test this, the current study investigated the effects of constructive news on emotions and online engagement. In an experiment, 20-40-year-old participants (n= 341) read a story containing constructive elements or not. Findings showed constructive news elicited lower levels of negative and higher levels of positive and inspirational emotional responses. Furthermore, reading constructive news partly affected readers' actual online behaviour: Millennials who read the constructive news 'liked' this news more often. These results suggest that constructive journalism might be a viable strategy to attract younger news users, especially when the news topic is relevant to their lives.","[Hermans, Liesbeth; Prins, Tineke] Univ Appl Sci Windesheim, Media Res Ctr, POB 10090, NL-8000 GB Zwolle, Netherlands",,"Prins, T (corresponding author), Univ Appl Sci Windesheim, Media Res Ctr, POB 10090, NL-8000 GB Zwolle, Netherlands.",ffj.prins@windesheim.nl,,"Prins, Tineke/0000-0003-1891-8293; Hermans, Liesbeth/0000-0003-4986-9156",,,,,52,12,14,9,65,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,MAY,2022.0,23.0,5,,,,,1064.0,1081.0,1.46488E+15,10.1177/1464884920944741,0.0,,Jul-20,18,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,0R6XK,,,,,2022/11/20,WOS:000552709400001,0

In this time of fragmented media use and evolving conceptions of (the importance and relevance of) news, this is not easy. Therefore, this focus group study investigated news consumption and news literacy through the eyes of early adolescents. Results showed that early adolescents have broad definitions of news. Their news consumption is predominantly passive, possibly due to a lack of intrinsic motivation. They see news as important, but often as boring, repetitive and negative, and disconnected from youth. Participants had knowledge of news content and effects, and stressed the importance of reliable news. However, for the majority, this did not translate into critical evaluation of news. For early adolescents, the key factor in becoming more news literate news consumers is motivation. Moving forward, motivation should be better incorporated in both research and practice.","[Tamboer, Sanne L.] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Behav Sci, Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Kleemans, Mariska; Daalmans, Serena] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Behav Sci Inst, POB 9104, NL-6500 HE Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Daalmans, Serena] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Commun Sci Dept, Nijmegen, Netherlands",Radboud University Nijmegen; Radboud University Nijmegen; Radboud University Nijmegen,"Tamboer, SL (corresponding author), Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Behav Sci Inst, POB 9104, NL-6500 HE Nijmegen, Netherlands.",s.tamboer@bsi.ru.nl,,"Tamboer, Sanne/0000-0001-9441-4236",,,,,36,14,14,7,26,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,APR,2022.0,23.0,4,,,,,806.0,822.0,1.46488E+15,10.1177/1464884920924527,0.0,,May-20,17,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,0M3LB,,"hybrid, Green Published",,,2022/11/20,WOS:000536560500001,0

Two themes emerge from attention to the conceptual framework, content analysis of CoronaCheck newsletters and interviews with fact-checkers and journalists. The first relates to the nexus between fact-checking communities of practice and the productive and collaborative networks that underpin their operation. The second builds on this to consider the structures, resources, and approaches that facilitate experimentation within the community.

Both their material complexity and lack of consensus make wicked problems difficult to address. This study uses British newspaper coverage of the H5N1 avian influenza outbreak (2003-2008) to determine if under near ideal conditions, newspaper coverage in the UK is compatible with the expectation that newspapers provide a forum that supports constructive societal debate of a complex, wicked problem. We chose to work with avian influenza because it was extensively covered, evidence rich, and not captive to clear partisan constructions. Our frame analysis examined 254 relevant newspaper articles published in seven national circulation outlets between 2003 and 2008. Newspaper coverage did reflect multiple problem definitions and causal interpretations of avian influenza, which is consistent with the expectation that the media inform and open up public debate. Coverage did not, however, link avian flu to other related issues, engage in systemic contestation or problematise structure. Finally, we found that, despite heterogeneous problem definitions, there was near consensus on a single technical solution. This coverage does not appear to support the open, constructive and informed public debate whose promise justifies the privileges given to news media.","[Garnier, Marie; van Wessel, Margit] Wageningen Univ & Res, Strateg Commun Chair Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Tamas, Peter A.] Wageningen Univ & Res, Wageningen, Netherlands; [van Bommel, Severine] Univ Queensland, Sch Agr & Food Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",Wageningen University & Research; Wageningen University & Research; University of Queensland,"Garnier, M (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ & Res, Strateg Commun Grp, Hollandseweg 1, NL-6700 EW Wageningen, Netherlands.",marie.garnierortiz@wur.nl,,"Garnier, Marie/0000-0002-2331-3136; Tamas, Peter/0000-0002-5409-1273; van Bommel, Severine/0000-0002-7782-9162",,,,,47,0,0,0,4,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,SEP,2022.0,23.0,9,,,,,2012.0,2035.0,1.46488E+15,10.1177/1464884920977781,0.0,,Dec-20,24,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,4J9KJ,,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2022/11/20,WOS:000600604100001,0

In this article, I reconceptualise the relationship between the quantitative and the qualitative through two metaphors that emerged during my interviews with journalists regarding their coverage of humanitarian crises. In doing so, I set my study within the long history of using metaphors in journalism studies. First, I point to the metaphor of colouring to outline how we can reimagine storytelling as the combination of data that provides form and shape and the personal that colours this structure. Second, I explore the metaphor of anchoring to appreciate the journalistic practice of connecting subjective personal accounts with the ontological solidity of data.

It analyses news stories on major corruption incidents involving embezzlement and the misuse of public funds by government officials in Uganda. The study employs a discourse analysis to explore how corruption is constructed and construed in the print media. It invokes Appraisal Theory to analyse hard news reports recounting corruption occurrences, proceedings or findings of commissions of inquiry into corruption incidents and arrests of suspects, public hearings and court proceedings of suspected corrupt persons across two daily newspapers published in English. The study explicates the nature of linguistic evaluative resources that news writers invoke to map feelings, and to evaluate news actors, processes and phenomena. The analysis reveals that news reporters heavily rely on external texts and voices to recount corruption stories. These sources are couched in legal language (legalese), which in turn impinges on the linguistic resources employed to evaluate news actors. Whereas this rhetorical strategy enables the news report to achieve 'objectivity', it appears to protect the journalist against defamation or slander. Appraisal analysis reveals dominant instances of negative inscriptions of the social sanction of propriety, namely overt negative evaluations of non-compliance with the civic responsibilities and state laws. The news reportage exhibits positive attributes of corrupt persons in relation to their material wealth and social capital.

However, they also serve as a platform to invite a more positive reading of strongman administration. Against the backdrop of media populism, the article will problematize how the Fourth Estate articulates its political stance by examining the tensions and complexities in editorials. It will highlight the ways the media deals with subjects and stories surrounding Rodrigo Duterte. Through an analysis of editorials of four leading dominant news outlets (Bulletin, Inquirer, Rappler, and Star), three meta-thematic categories of media frames are uncovered. First, character degradation frames delineate how the media denounces the ties of Duterte with other political actors, particularly the Marcoses and China's Xi. Second, pro-establishment frames echo the optimistic mantra of the government amid crisis. And third, non-editorial frames exhibit the failure of media to publish watchdog-inspired editorials. Each of these categories has underlying frames that are indicative of the democratic potential, or lack thereof, of news media.","[Ragragio, Jefferson Lyndon D.] Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Journalism, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Hong Kong Baptist University,"Ragragio, JLD (corresponding author), Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Kowloon Tong, Kowloon, Room 808,5 Hereford Rd, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",jeffragragio@gmail.com,,"Ragragio, Jefferson Lyndon D./0000-0003-4497-8433",,,,,58,1,1,1,8,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,JUN,2022.0,23.0,6,,,,,1301.0,1318.0,1.46488E+15,10.1177/1464884920959505,0.0,,Sep-20,18,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,1N8QT,,,,,2022/11/20,WOS:000574752400001,0

It identifies a direct link between a journalist's style of reporting and the level of risk to which they might be exposed, as well as between neo-paramilitary decisions to kill or intimidate and the level of law enforcement in operation. It is argued that anti-press violence is connected to the perpetrators' democratic and economic survival. In these circumstances, anti-press violence is presented as a tool of criminal governance to maintain the alternative social (dis)order and protect the neo-paramilitaries'brutalact of 'insurgent citizenship'.

The idea is that, through the application of immersive technologies, the news consumer can engage with and be part of the story.

First, based on an interdisciplinary literature review, we propose a conceptual model of immersive journalism. We then use the elements of this model to content analyze 189 journalistic productions that are labeled as immersive by the producers, including 360 degree videos, computer-generated VR, and interactive, 360 web productions, stemming from a variety of outlets and countries. Results show that the level of user immersion in these productions is actually limited, with little interaction and technical inclusion possibilities.

For this experiment the topics of two socially relevant issues were used; plastic waste in the ocean and the housing market. Results showed that constructive reporting elicited lower levels of negative emotions and higher levels of positive emotions compared to nonconstructive news. Moreover, we found that the mediation of emotions was largely dependent on the topic of the news. While more negative feelings led to more factual knowledge of the housing market topic, an increase of positive emotions led to higher perceived knowledge scores on both the housing market and plastic waste topic.

The stories, randomly sampled from eight top US publications, were predominantly about men artists and by men authors, and were more likely to discuss women musicians' appearance and relationships, and used more sexualized and emotional language. Improvement was found in that articles were no more likely to discuss women musicians' age and youth than men's. Women journalists were just as likely to stereotype women musicians as men journalists were, and more so in one category. We expand stereotyping by incorporating insights from professional socialization and applying it to the 'soft news' yet male-dominated field of music journalism, adding to our knowledge of hard news fields such as politics, business and sports.

We apply Bourdieu's concept ofillusioto advance our understanding of expectations and experiences in the journalistic field and as an explanation for why journalists tend to remain in the profession. Based on in-depth interviews with 40 Austrian journalists we found that autonomy constitutes a key facet of the field's illusio, both as an ideal of journalistic work, as well as the superior reason to become a journalist despite the awareness of financial drawbacks. While respondents are disillusioned by the lack of autonomous decision-making in everyday work, they still adhere to the ideal of acting as autonomous providers of information and thus remain in the profession. Crucially, they believe that accepting periods of precarity, as well as less autonomous work empowers them to better contribute to journalism's societal mission.","[Noelleke, Daniel; Maares, Phoebe; Hanusch, Folker] Univ Vienna, Dept Commun, Journalism Studies Ctr, Vienna, Austria",University of Vienna,"Nolleke, D (corresponding author), Univ Vienna, Dept Commun, Wahringer Str 29, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.",daniel.noelleke@univie.ac.at,"Maares, Phoebe/AAD-9907-2022; Maares, Phoebe/AAJ-5350-2021","Maares, Phoebe/0000-0002-9518-7132; Hanusch, Folker/0000-0002-7344-0483; Nolleke, Daniel/0000-0002-3494-3897",,,,,60,3,5,0,8,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,FEB,2022.0,23.0,2,,,,,320.0,336.0,1.46488E+15,10.1177/1464884920956820,0.0,,Sep-20,17,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,YP1AV,,hybrid,,,2022/11/20,WOS:000569103300001,0

It has had to adapt to the changing rhythms of media consumption as much as to the benevolence of social media networks that constantly change algorithms of how journalism is displayed. At the same time, viral communication of all sorts - from memes to GIFs and widespread amateur entertaining videos - is seen by millions. The purpose of this article is to examine the effort of online journalism to compete with viral storytelling. 'Viral journalism' is defined as the strategy and tactics to promote quality media stories on the internet in order to gain maximum exposure and sharing. This phenomenon is not to be mistaken with 'clickbait', which entails catchy, but often misleading, headlines. This article is based on qualitative interviews with a variety of social media editors and other journalists in the UK: from The Economist to The Guardian. It reveals that quality UK media deploy a range of inventive engaging tactics, but reject virality as a long-term strategy. The media professionals interviewed raised many concerns about virality, indicating that exploiting viral technics may result in reputational damage and alienating loyal readers.","[Denisova, Anastasia] Univ Westminster, Commun & Media Res Inst, Watford Rd, London HA1 3TP, England",University of Westminster,"Denisova, A (corresponding author), Univ Westminster, Commun & Media Res Inst, Watford Rd, London HA1 3TP, England.",a.denisova1@westminster.ac.uk,,"Denisova, Anastasia/0000-0002-8832-6261",,,,,43,0,0,5,10,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1177/14648849221077749,0.0,,Mar-22,19,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,0D0UF,,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2022/11/20,WOS:000775718200001,0

This article explores readers' perceptions and attitudes toward the economic and informative value of online news in particular, and toward the Internet as a means of news dissemination in general. Drawing upon 50 in-depth interviews with respondents from Spain aged 18-65 years, we conceptualize the lack of readers' inclinations to pay for digital news as a culture of free and explore its main dimensions. Specifically, the culture of free is a strong orientation to considering news as a public good that must be free of charge, rooted in customs/habits of free consumption on the Internet over decades, fueled by free competition, subtended by advertising, and a lack of interest in the news more generally. Despite the fact that the digital versions might be theoretically considered as inferior, we argue that both products (print vs online) are equally valuable (economically and informatively) and the only divergence lies in their format and thus in their price.","[Goyanes, Manuel; de Grado, Laura] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Madrid, Spain; [Demeter, Marton] Natl Univ Publ Serv, Commun & Media Studies, Budapest, Hungary",Universidad Carlos III de Madrid; University of Public Service,"Goyanes, M (corresponding author), Univ Carlos III Madrid, Fac Humanidades Comunicac & Documentac, Dept Comunicac, Calle Madrid 133, Madrid 28903, Spain.",mgoyanes@hum.uc3m.es,"Goyanes, Manuel/ABG-1225-2020; Demeter, Marton/J-8004-2019","Goyanes, Manuel/0000-0001-8329-0610; Demeter, Marton/0000-0002-9888-9682",National Program of I+D+i; European Regional Development Fund (ERDF),National Program of I+D+i; European Regional Development Fund (ERDF)(European Commission),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the National Program of I+D+i oriented to the Challenges of Society and the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) about Nuevos valores, gobernanza, financiacion y servicios audiovisuales publicos para la sociedad de Internet: contrastes europeos y espanoles.",,34,4,4,1,4,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,JAN,2022.0,23.0,1,,,,,207.0,223.0,1.46488E+15,10.1177/1464884920913436,0.0,,Mar-20,17,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,XW1QR,,,,,2022/11/20,WOS:000525731700001,0

The normative expectations of PSM and their performance have been extensively discussed from a theoretical and regulatory approach, but studies from an audience perspective are still rather scarce. If PSM's primary stakeholder is to be considered the citizenship it serves, it is, therefore, vital to understand what is valuable to society and how citizens assess PSM's performance. Drawing upon representative survey data from Spain (N = 1717), this study examines the role played by structural and perceptual variables in accounting for the citizen's assessment of the national public broadcaster (TVE), considering six roles: watchdog, analysis, mobilization, public forum, social empathy, and information. Findings first indicate that perceptions of independence and citizens' evaluation of TVE's journalists are positively associated with all dimensions of TVE evaluations. However, when exploring the role of political knowledge, results indicate a negative association with some of PSM's most critical functions. All in all, our research illustrates that, despite all the changes in the media landscape, when it comes to delivering the news, citizens seem to stick to values traditionally associated with PSM: independent and qualified journalism trained for and committed to the public service of delivering accurate and unbiased information.","[Campos-Rueda, Marcela; Goyanes, Manuel] Carlos III Univ, Dept Commun, Calle Madrid 133, Madrid, Spain",Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,"Goyanes, M (corresponding author), Carlos III Univ, Dept Commun, Calle Madrid 133, Madrid, Spain.",mgoyanes@hum.uc3m.es,"Goyanes, Manuel/ABG-1225-2020",,Spanish National Program of I+D+i about Medios audiovisuales p 'ublicos ante el ecosistema de las plataformas: modelos de gestion y evaluacion del valor p 'ublico de referencia para Espana [PID2021-122386OB-I00],Spanish National Program of I+D+i about Medios audiovisuales p 'ublicos ante el ecosistema de las plataformas: modelos de gestion y evaluacion del valor p 'ublico de referencia para Espana,"Y The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study is supported by Spanish National Program of I+D+i about Medios audiovisuales p ' ublicos ante el ecosistema de las plataformas: modelos de gestion y evaluacion del valor p ' ublico de referencia para Espana (PID2021-122386OB-I00).",,84,0,0,2,2,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1177/14648849221114948,0.0,,Jul-22,21,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,2V0FQ,,,,,2022/11/20,WOS:000823528700001,0

Although organizational leaders do understand the need for a transformation, they do not always succeed in making the organizational transformation. Drawing on the literature of boundary spanning in combination with the organizational literature on leadership, this study aims to understand how organizational leaders can foster the organizational transformation. This study examines to what extent organizational leaders can empower and facilitate boundary spanners to overcome the institutional boundaries in the transformation process of a local news media organization. Evidence comes from in-dept interviews with journalists, non-journalists and managers from a regional news media organization in transformation in the Netherlands. Our findings show that the effectiveness of boundary spanners depends on how organizational leaders set organizational goals and organize the reward system. Furthermore, nominated boundary spanners with a coaching logic are more effective than spanners with an authoritarian logic to transform a hierarchical organization into an agile network organization. Another finding is that the introduced scrum methodology to improve organizational agility and innovativeness only works effectively with diverse teams.","[Keij, Lotte; van Kranenburg, Hans] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Nijmegen Sch Management, Inst Management Res IMR, Nijmegen, Netherlands",Radboud University Nijmegen,"van Kranenburg, H (corresponding author), Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Management Res, Nijmegen Sch Management, Heyendaalseweg 141, NL-6525 AJ Nijmegen, Netherlands.",hans.vankranenburg@ru.nl,,,,,,,73,0,0,6,6,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,,,,,,,,,,,1.46E+16,10.1177/14648849221105721,0.0,,Jun-22,19,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,1V8OB,,hybrid,,,2022/11/20,WOS:000806342800001,0

Epistemic modes refer to different ways of knowing, which are managed by newsrooms through journalistic and editorial practices. We draw from an empirical study of terrorism-related news production in the Finnish Broadcasting Company (Yle). Our data consist of thematic interviews (N = 33) with Yle journalists, producers, and content managers and newsroom observations (14 days) conducted at Yle. The study investigates the data through a grounded theory approach with the aim of creating a theoretical understanding of knowledge production in hybrid media events. The results are drawn from a qualitative content analysis and close reading of the interview data, with the other data sets informing the core analysis. The article identifies seven epistemic modes of relevance to news production in hybrid media events: not-knowing, description, rumoring, witnessing, emotion, analysing and perpetrating. The modes are analysed in relation to three dimensions of crisis reporting: immediate sense-making, ritualizing and transformation back to normalcy. The article finds that although particular epistemic modes are typical to certain dimensions of reporting hybrid, disruptive media events, both the modes and the dimensions also are also merged and intermixed. This condition together with growing amounts of problematic epistemic modes of rumoring, emotion and perpetrating challenge journalists' epistemic authority in reporting hybrid media events involving terrorist violence.","[Uusitalo, Niina] Tampere Univ, Res Ctr Journalism Media & Commun COMET, Tampere, Finland; [Valaskivi, Katja] Univ Helsinki, Relig & Digital World, Helsinki, Finland; [Sumiala, Johanna] Univ Helsinki, Media & Commun, Helsinki, Finland",Tampere University; University of Helsinki; University of Helsinki,"Uusitalo, N (corresponding author), Tampere Univ, Fac Informat Technol & Commun Sci, COMET, E313, Tampere 33014, Finland.",niina.uusitalo@tuni.fi,"Valaskivi, Katja/ABI-6629-2022","Uusitalo, Niina/0000-0002-0758-1157; Sumiala, Johanna/0000-0002-4773-4509",Academy of Finland [326642],Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The article was funded by the Academy of Finland (Funding decision No. 326642, Hybrid Terrorizing, HYTE research consortium).",,46,0,0,3,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,SEP,2022.0,23.0,9,,,,,1811.0,1827.0,1.46E+16,10.1177/14648849211015601,0.0,,May-21,17,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,4J9KJ,,"hybrid, Green Published",,,2022/11/20,WOS:000652304200001,0

This study aimed to extend the concept of discursive integration to another popular form of satirical news: written satirical news. We focused on both liberal (e.g. The Onion) and conservative (e.g. The Babylon Bee) online outlets of satire. We collected texts published in 2018 by a total of 36 satirical news, regular news and fiction websites (65,530,647 words). Discursive integration was measured by means of linguistic register, because genres can be effectively identified through patterns of linguistic features. Four linguistic register dimensions were identified. Findings showed that written satirical news is indeed characterised by discursive integration because written satirical news' register scored in between the registers of written regular news and written fiction. No differences in discursive integration levels were found between liberal and conservative satirical news.

With a suicide death every 40 seconds worldwide, it is imperative journalists understand and recognise the best ethical practices in order to report suicide responsibly. To address these shortcomings, the authors present a model for responsible suicide reporting (RSR) that is grounded in news-work and embeds media reporting guidelines within journalistic storytelling practices. The RSR model consists of a typology of suicide narratives and 'othering', ethical rules and a standard of moderation. Methodologically, these typologies emerged from analysis of 159 suicide news stories published in 2018-19, with particular focus on adherence and non-adherence to global media reporting guidelines. We posit through the process of producing stories using the RSR model, journalists should interact more effectively with critical risk factors for example, stigmatisation, copycat effects, harmful speculation, highlighted by media reporting guidelines.","[Duncan, Sallyanne] Univ Strathclyde, Journalism, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Luce, Ann] Bournemouth Univ, Journalism & Commun, Poole, Dorset, England",University of Strathclyde; Bournemouth University,"Duncan, S (corresponding author), Univ Strathclyde, Sch Humanities, Level 4,Lord Hope Bldg,141 St James Rd, Glasgow G1 1XQ, Lanark, Scotland.",sallyanne.duncan@strath.ac.uk,,,,,,,63,5,5,0,7,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,MAY,2022.0,23.0,5,,,,,1132.0,1148.0,1.46488E+15,10.1177/1464884920952685,0.0,,Aug-20,17,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,0R6XK,,"hybrid, Green Accepted",,,2022/11/20,WOS:000563682400001,0

It examines the extent to which journalists have adopted data journalism in business news and how this has altered their news reporting practices. It is based on a textual analysis of business news stories from two selected prominent business newspapers -Business DayandThe Financial Mailand qualitative interviews with business news reporters. The study finds that there is a (gradually) increasing uptake of data-driven business news reporting practices, tempered by journalists' concerns regarding their own individual professional capabilities. Furthermore, the practice has increasingly created a new narrative of corporate accountability in the press and inculcated collaboration in newsrooms. It argues that data-driven business news practices have upended the 'rhythimised' and 'routinised' news production processes by, among other aspects, empowering non-elite news sources, fostering newsroom collaborations and agentive the newsrooms. However, there is need for a recalibration of journalism education if data-driven reporting practices are to be more sustainable.","[Munoriyarwa, Allen] Univ Johannesburg, Dept Journalism Film & Televis, B Ring 6,APK, ZA-2006 Auckland Pk, South Africa",University of Johannesburg,"Munoriyarwa, A (corresponding author), Univ Johannesburg, Dept Journalism Film & Televis, B Ring 6,APK, ZA-2006 Auckland Pk, South Africa.",allenm@uj.ac.za,"Munoriyarwa, Allen/AED-7461-2022","Munoriyarwa, Allen/0000-0001-5064-3192",,,,,48,4,4,1,20,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,MAY,2022.0,23.0,5,,,,,1097.0,1113.0,1.46488E+15,10.1177/1464884920951386,0.0,,Aug-20,17,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,0R6XK,,,,,2022/11/20,WOS:000560803300001,0

Accordingly, journalism culture and the way journalists construct their roles and identities in the face of constraints in Iran have received scant attention. This study redresses this gap by focusing on Iranian journalists' role conceptions and perceptions of role enactment. Based on interviews with 26 journalists working in media outlets in Iran, this study found that the role conceptions of Iranian journalists correspond to adversarial advocate, detective watchdog, change agent, educator and informer roles. Although the journalists perceive a large gap between their role ideals and their role performance, they believe they have occasionally been successful in acting out their roles. Journalists' role conceptions and perceived role enactment serve as journalistic illusio, which not only motivate journalists to continue operating under pressure but also allow the journalistic field to exist and function over time in the restrictive media environment of Iran. These results are discussed in relation to whether and how journalism outside a democratic context is possible.","[Ranji, Banafsheh] Univ Oslo, Dept Media & Commun, POB 1093 Blindern, N-0316 Oslo, Norway",University of Oslo,"Ranji, B (corresponding author), Univ Oslo, Dept Media & Commun, POB 1093 Blindern, N-0316 Oslo, Norway.",banafsheh.ranji@media.uio.no,"Ranji, Banafsheh/ABC-1363-2020","Ranji, Banafsheh/0000-0002-0679-4193",,,,,50,6,6,5,9,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,FEB,2022.0,23.0,2,,,,,517.0,532.0,1.46488E+15,10.1177/1464884920922026,0.0,,May-20,16,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,YP1AV,,"hybrid, Green Published",,,2022/11/20,WOS:000532928400001,0

As the analysis demonstrates, all the outlets, including the African ones, adopt essentialised cliches of barbaric perpetrators and innocent victims, embroiled in ethnic conflict. Various configurations of these elements of the story are identified as it travels from one context to another. In general, the international outlets focus on a brutal dictator and a passive, victimised mass, but this narrative is reversed in the government-run Burundian outlet, which assigns barbarism to the protestors and legitimacy to the president. The Daily Nation is unique in framing these elements within a broader international narrative, demonstrating Burundi's relative vulnerability to international (neoimperial) actors. In the final discussion, the article considers how Western journalism can learn from this cross-cultural analysis, drawing on Venuti's (1995) concepts of foreignisation and domestication. It is argued that The Daily Nation's emphasis on neoimperial influence on Burundi may be a form of domestication to Kenyan readers but would undoubtedly be considered a foreignising strategy to Western European readers, as it would alert them to the injustices of supposedly legitimate international (Western) institutions. While recognising the challenges of such a strategy in journalism, it is argued that news outlets should nonetheless consider presenting African conflict news using less stereotyped narratives, informed by a postcolonial interpretative lens.","[Williamson Sinalo, Caroline] Univ Coll Cork, World Languages, Cork, Ireland",University College Cork,"Sinalo, CW (corresponding author), Univ Coll Cork, French Dept, Coll Rd, Cork T12 K8AF, Ireland.",caroline.williamsonsinalo@ucc.ie,,"Williamson Sinalo, Caroline/0000-0002-1105-3314",,,,,30,1,1,1,13,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,JAN,2022.0,23.0,1,,,,,243.0,258.0,1.46488E+15,10.1177/1464884920922009,0.0,,May-20,16,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,XW1QR,,,,,2022/11/20,WOS:000532945800001,0

The Black witness who films a fatal police encounter on her phone is talking to the Black victim, promising not to leave him in his final moments. The distant Black witness who sees that video then talks back to the witness and the victim, creating powerful imagery that amplifies the tragic footage. In this manner, those working under the broad banner of the Black Lives Matter movement have reimagined a dynamic Black visual public sphere, where moral arguments about police brutality are sustained through an assemblage of strategic visual appeals. In this essay, I argue that this call-and-response of Black corporeal iconography forms the vanguard of embodied protest journalism in the 21st century. I explain how the concepts of strong objectivity, which is rooted in feminist standpoint theory, help validate and liberate the flesh witnessing of the marginalized. Moreover, I offer two broad categories of imagery that Black activists create most often in response to fatal police shootings: historic juxtapositions and symbolic deaths.","[Richardson, Allissa, V] Annenberg USC, Los Angeles, CA USA",,"Richardson, AV (corresponding author), Univ Southern Calif, Annenberg Sch Commun & Journalism, 3630 Watt Way, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",allissar@usc.edu,,,,,,,46,0,0,1,2,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,MAR,2022.0,23.0,3,,,SI,,599.0,613.0,1.46E+16,10.1177/14648849211064072,0.0,,Dec-21,15,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,ZO6IV,,,,,2022/11/20,WOS:000740712900001,0

Our findings indicate that although news consumption in general appears to be evenly distributed, with no significant gaps according to age, gender, education and socioeconomic status, print newspaper consumption seems to be the preserve of older, more affluent, mostly male audiences in ways that reinforce patriarchal family patterns - it is usually husbands and fathers who decide for the entire household which newspaper is purchased and when that takes place. In addition, newspaper reading is carried on by those at the top of the income-earning pyramid, and reinforces class status mainly due to the persistent associations between newspaper readership, civic duty, and professional prestige.

Guided by the framework of boundary work, this paper examines how traditional fashion journalists and fashion bloggers define their own professionalism and what that says about the negotiation of fashion journalism's boundaries. Through a textual analysis of the 'About' pages of 40 mainstream fashion magazine websites and fashion blogs, this paper shows that fashion magazines and fashion blogs demonstrate differences in four areas: mode of presentation, rituals of asserting authority, organisational structure, and relationship with the audience. For each theme, fashion magazine websites and fashion blogs display different approaches that help to shape their professional identities. These four areas serve as markers of the emerging - and perhaps blurring - boundaries between the two media actors. Findings from this study have implications not just on boundary work in journalism, but also on the very definitions of journalist and journalism, and on the evolving digital cultural industry, particularly in relation to lifestyle-centred content.","[Cheng, Lydia] Nanyang Technol Univ, Singapore, Singapore; [Tandoc, Edson C., Jr.] Nanyang Technol Univ, Wee Kim Wee Sch Commun & Informat, 31 Nanyang Link, Singapore 637718, Singapore",Nanyang Technological University & National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore; Nanyang Technological University; Nanyang Technological University & National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore; Nanyang Technological University,"Cheng, L (corresponding author), Nanyang Technol Univ, Wee Kim Wee Sch Commun & Informat, 31 Nanyang Link, Singapore 637718, Singapore.",lydiarui001@e.ntu.edu.sg,,"Tandoc, Edson/0000-0002-8740-9313; Cheng, Lydia/0000-0002-7468-464X",,,,,56,3,3,6,19,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,JUN,2022.0,23.0,6,,,,,1213.0,1232.0,1.46488E+15,10.1177/1464884920988183,0.0,,Jan-21,20,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,1N8QT,,,,,2022/11/20,WOS:000610318200001,0

To this end, this study compared the salience and framing of coverage of the Arrow missile project in the Israeli press and among Israeli journalists to the coverage of two other complex topics - the Dolphin submarine project and the Merkava tank project. Two Israeli newspapers were examined: Ha'aretz, which appeals mainly to intellectual readers, and the mass- circulation Yedioth Aharonoth. The findings show that the Arrow project received much more salient coverage than the other projects examined, thanks to the salience Reuven Pedatzur, Ha'aretz journalist, afforded the project. Moreover, Pedatzur's negative framings of the Arrow project were the most salient, such that the project was framed more negatively than positively, as was also the case for the Merkava tank project, which was framed negatively by Ha'aretz journalist Amnon Barzilai, though its salience was much lower. Hence, the findings of this study contribute to constructing a normative and effective model for journalistic work. The model centers on personal affinity for the topic covered, a sense of mission regarding the need to change the policy of a political institution, specialization in and study of the topic under consideration, a solid standing in the world of journalism, journalistic experience, backing from high quality and anti-establishment journalistic institution and support from the military (the air force in this case) and the political elite.","[Frenkel, Haim] Coll Management Acad Studies, Sch Media Studies, Rishon Leziyyon, Israel; [Frenkel, Haim] Kinneret Acad Coll Sea Galilee, 11 Emek Haela St, IL-52621 Ramat Gan, Israel; [Nossek, Hillel] Kinneret Acad Coll, Ramat Gan, Israel",College of Management Academic Studies,"Frenkel, H (corresponding author), Kinneret Acad Coll Sea Galilee, 11 Emek Haela St, IL-52621 Ramat Gan, Israel.;Frenkel, H (corresponding author), Coll Management Acad Studies, Sch Media Studies, 11 Emek Haela St, IL-52621 Ramat Gan, Israel.",hdfrenkel@gmail.com,,,,,,,43,0,0,0,1,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,FEB,2022.0,23.0,2,,,,,427.0,443.0,1.46488E+15,10.1177/1464884920975234,0.0,,Nov-20,17,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,YP1AV,,,,,2022/11/20,WOS:000600591900001,0

The article also discusses to what degree the newspapers may be taking advantage of users' preferences for content with populist features to reinforce their watchdog role and boost audience ratings. Our findings also contribute to understanding how populist leaders and media organizations can build a mutually beneficial relationship, even though they publicly claim to oppose each other. Finally, the paper suggests new hypotheses to be explored, such as the argument that quality papers may be loosening the division between news and opinion when using social media to satisfy audience niches in polarized environments.","[Fontes, Giulia Sbaraini; Jamil Marques, Francisco Paulo] Univ Fed Parana, Dept Polit Sci, Rua Gen Carneiro 460,Ed Dom Pedro 1,5 Andar, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Parana,"Marques, FPJ (corresponding author), Univ Fed Parana, Dept Polit Sci, Rua Gen Carneiro 460,Ed Dom Pedro 1,5 Andar, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil.",giuliasfontes@gmail.com; marquesjamil@gmail.com,"; Marques, Francisco Paulo Jamil/D-3343-2009","Sbaraini Fontes, Giulia/0000-0002-3637-3605; Marques, Francisco Paulo Jamil/0000-0002-5256-1964",Brazilian National Scientific Council (CNPq) [310724/2020-1]; Brazilian Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES) [88887.478242/2020-00],Brazilian National Scientific Council (CNPq)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)Fundacao de Apoio a Pesquisa do Distrito Federal (FAPDF)); Brazilian Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was funded by the Brazilian National Scientific Council (CNPq) (310724/2020-1) and by the Brazilian Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES) (88887.478242/2020-00).",,81,3,3,6,6,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,,,,,,,,,,,1.46E+16,10.1177/14648849221075429,0.0,,Mar-22,23,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,ZT8KH,,,,,2022/11/20,WOS:000769398500001,0

It investigates how the protests were represented in the translated Chinese-language news produced by selected media from China, the UK and the US, and how these news articles were 're-framed' (Baker, 2006) from their original English versions. The study proposes an analytical framework of corpus-based critical framing analysis, which combines critical discourse analysis, corpus analysis and framing analysis. It identifies some prominent news frames and several consistent framing patterns in the coverage of the protests: Reference News mainly adopts government and public frames and textual strategies of addition and omission; BBC Chinese employs social action and process frames, as well as a combination of framing strategies and devices at the textual, intratextual and paratextual levels; The New York Times Chinese (re)frames the events mostly through individual and geographical frames, and paratextual devices of news headlines and images. These news frames and framing patterns demonstrate the distinct political stances held by the media outlets towards the events.","[Ping, Yuan] Hangzhou Dianzi Univ, English Language & Translat, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Ping, Yuan] Hangzhou Dianzi Univ, Ctr Translat Studies, Sch Foreign Languages, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Hangzhou Dianzi University; Hangzhou Dianzi University,"Ping, Y (corresponding author), Hangzhou Dianzi Univ, Sch Foreign Languages, Hangzhou 310018, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",y.ping@hdu.edu.cn,,,China Scholarship Council-University of Leeds scholarship,China Scholarship Council-University of Leeds scholarship,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the China Scholarship Council-University of Leeds scholarship.",,50,0,0,18,33,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,JUL,2022.0,23.0,7,,,SI,,1509.0,1529.0,,10.1177/14648849221074556,0.0,,Mar-22,21,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,2E6BM,,,,,2022/11/20,WOS:000765430100001,0

They report journalistically on lifestyle topics such as travel, food, or fashion, while also incorporating promotional content and public relations concerns, either because reporting on lifestyle topics would otherwise not be possible or because their publications depend economically on commercial partners. These differing demands could lead to role conflicts for the editors of lifestyle magazines. This study investigates how lifestyle editors perceive expectations regarding their professional role and whether diverging expectations lead to role conflicts. To answer these questions, qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted with lifestyle editors from Germany. The results show that lifestyle editors aim primarily to entertain, spread positivity, and inspire their readers, while attempting to report independently and objectively.

A sustainable business model to replace traditional dependence on advertising has not yet been established. This paper examines one aspect of the business - audience payment - to explore the viability of online news subscription models in the context of local news. An online survey of 2038 news consumers in regional Australia was conducted in 2019 to examine regional news audiences' perception of the value of news as a social good and their willingness to pay for it. The results show that interest in supporting a new online local news outlet was largely determined by community-oriented values such as a sense of belonging, the ability to share the news with others, and the loss of a local news service, rather than the actual content. However, the quality of the journalism content was positively related to the audiences' willingness to pay. Trust in local news and existing local news consumption were important factors in determining both the interest in supporting local news and their willingness to pay for it. These findings highlight the tension between the social and financial value of regional news and the obstacles facing entrepreneurs hoping to address the growing news gaps in regional communities.","[Park, Sora] Univ Canberra, Fac Arts & Design, Res, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Park, Sora] Univ Canberra, Commun, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Fisher, Caroline] Univ Canberra, News & Media Res Ctr, 11 Kirinari St, Canberra, ACT 2617, Australia; [Fisher, Caroline] Univ Canberra, Fac Arts & Design, Commun, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Lee, Jee Young] Univ Canberra, Fac Arts & Design, Canberra, ACT, Australia",University of Canberra; University of Canberra; University of Canberra; University of Canberra; University of Canberra,"Park, S (corresponding author), Univ Canberra, News & Media Res Ctr, 11 Kirinari St, Canberra, ACT 2617, Australia.",sora.park@canberra.edu.au,"Park, Sora/H-3296-2013","Park, Sora/0000-0003-3082-314X; Fisher, Caroline/0000-0002-7443-3787",Google News Initiative,Google News Initiative(Google Incorporated),"The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The authors received funding from Google News Initiative for this research.",,48,1,1,9,34,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,AUG,2022.0,23.0,8,,,,,1663.0,1681.0,1.46488E+15,10.1177/1464884921992998,0.0,,Feb-21,19,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,3V8NI,,,,,2022/11/20,WOS:000620726300001,0

By employing framing and content analysis, the paper takes a closer look at the ways in which four Greek newspapers portrayed immigration in crisis-stricken Greece between 2011 and 2014. Results indicate that a conflict frame prevailed in the majority of all newspaper articles analyzed. In this context, immigration was portrayed (1) as an issue that generated conflict among different political and social groups, (2) through stereotypical portrayals of immigrants as a threat to public health and security, (3) as a mass of people in extreme conditions of exception, and (4) as a problem to almost every aspect of the Greek society: for tourism, trade, the economy or even Greece's relationship with the EU. A peace frame, conversely, was identified in around one fourth of all news stories. At the same time, findings lead us to conclusions that transcend the peace and conflict journalism dualism revealing five distinct subframes that provide a more nuanced understanding of the peace journalism concept; (1) a 'direct conflict subframe' enhancing division and dispute over immigration, (2) a 'journalism of conventions subframe' following well-established journalistic conventions with important consequences on the quality of information, (3) a 'journalism of values subframe' being closer to the traditional values of journalism, (4) a 'diversity journalism subframe', including all elements referring to a pro-immigrant approach, and (5) a 'positive peace subframe', closer to Galtung's notion of positive peace.","[Kalfeli, Naya] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Sch Journalism & Mass Commun, Egnatia Str 46, Thessaloniki 54625, Greece; [Frangonikolopoulos, Christos] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Int Relat & Mass Commun, Sch Journalism & Mass Commun, Thessaloniki, Greece; [Frangonikolopoulos, Christos] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, European Integrat Journalism, Sch Journalism & Mass Commun, Thessaloniki, Greece; [Gardikiotis, Antonis] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece",Aristotle University of Thessaloniki; Aristotle University of Thessaloniki; Aristotle University of Thessaloniki; Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,"Kalfeli, N (corresponding author), Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Sch Journalism & Mass Commun, Egnatia Str 46, Thessaloniki 54625, Greece.",nkalfeli@gmail.com,"Gardikiotis, Antonis/AFT-1419-2022; Gardikiotis, Antonis/AET-4442-2022","Gardikiotis, Antonis/0000-0001-5009-6002; Frangonikolopoulos, Christos/0000-0002-7888-9861",,,,,48,2,2,0,7,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,AUG,2022.0,23.0,8,,,,,1789.0,1806.0,1.46488E+15,10.1177/1464884920969089,0.0,,Oct-20,18,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,3V8NI,,,,,2022/11/20,WOS:000598487400001,0

Furthermore, the use of FSE enables the expression of solidarity and advocacy by reporters. I argue that the intervention to journalism as performed by feminist Argentine journalists and editors yields profound transformations to journalism practice and news content, as FSE destabilize and complicate traditional notions of journalistic objectivity and its role in democratic societies.","[Cabas-Mijares, Ayleen] Marquette Univ, Diederich Coll Commun, 1131 W Wisconsin Ave, Milwaukee, WI 53233 USA",Marquette University,"Cabas-Mijares, A (corresponding author), Marquette Univ, Diederich Coll Commun, 1131 W Wisconsin Ave, Milwaukee, WI 53233 USA.",ayleen.cabasmijares@marquette.edu,,"Cabas-Mijares, Ayleen/0000-0002-4559-2658",,,,,60,0,0,0,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,,,,,,,,,,,1.46E+16,10.1177/14648849221090741,0.0,,Apr-22,19,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,0O5GC,,,,,2022/11/20,WOS:000783553500001,0

Alternatively expressed, how it can utilise its communicative capacity to facilitate and contribute to contextually and culturally appropriate versions of sustainable peace within civil society. Peacebuilding tool kits are wide and varied and often narrowly focus on news journalism as a political actor and its role in political life. We would like to shift the focus away from the 'political' to the role that news journalism can play in the (re-)building of an associative and cooperative civil society. Specifically, we believe that news journalism should and can develop for itself an ethos of civil norm building that aims to stimulate a civil consciousness in its audiences which is indispensable for the practical application of the categories of civil norms of peaceful cooperation in everyday life. To understand how such an ethos can be developed we need to recognise three features that are necessary for news journalism to achieve its potential as a civil norm builder: (1) its transformative communicative capacity, (2) its institutional and organisational commitment toward news reporting that exemplifies peaceful cooperation in everyday life and (3) the way it can concretely undertake the application of editorial guidelines in post-civil war settings which exemplify the three basic categories of civil norms of peaceful cooperation: (a) assent to civil peace, (b) substantive civility and (c) building civil capacity and civil competencies.","[Harrison, Jackie; Pukallus, Stefanie] Univ Sheffield, Dept Journalism Studies, CFOM, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Pukallus, S (corresponding author), Univ Sheffield, Dept Journalism Studies, 9 Mappin St, Sheffield S1 4DT, S Yorkshire, England.",s.pukallus@shef.ac.uk,,,,,,,92,0,0,2,2,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,,,,,,,,,,,1.46E+16,10.1177/14648849211072947,0.0,,Jan-22,19,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,ZL3KL,,"Green Accepted, hybrid",,,2022/11/20,WOS:000763576700001,0

Among such actors are public debaters who establish themselves as professional opinion-makers and media personalities via 'media provocations'. In this article, we develop a conceptual framework for studying how these media provocateurs emerge as influential personas in journalism. Whereas previous research has provided important insights into how similar non-traditional actors have challenged journalism from a sociological perspective, we adopt a rhetorical perspective on the phenomenon and describe how the provocateurs' public persona constructions evolve in a sequential, cumulative, and transformative communicative process that cuts across different rhetorical situations in a hybrid media system. The proposed framework points to several future avenues of research into how non-traditional actors, such as media provocateurs, (micro-)bloggers, and social media influencers, may reflect the current state and direction of journalism.","[Ronlev, Rasmus] Univ Southern Denmark, Ctr Journalism, Rhetor Argumentat & Narrat Journalism, Odense, Denmark; [Bengtsson, Mette] Roskilde Univ, Journalism, Roskilde, Denmark",University of Southern Denmark; Roskilde University,"Ronlev, R (corresponding author), Univ Southern Denmark, Campusvej 55, DK-5230 Odense, Denmark.;Bengtsson, M (corresponding author), Roskilde Univ, Kommunikat Vej 1, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark.",roenlev@journalism.sdu.dk; bengtsson@ruc.dk,,"Bengtsson, Mette/0000-0002-0019-9182; Ronlev, Rasmus/0000-0001-7014-2141",,,,,72,0,0,0,11,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,JUN,2022.0,23.0,6,,,,,1233.0,1249.0,1.46488E+15,10.1177/1464884920957166,0.0,,Sep-20,17,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,1N8QT,,,,,2022/11/20,WOS:000569841200001,0

'Identity journalism' is an emic term that valorises the construction of identities as journalism's prerogative and enacts this by supplying news that amplifies views around which conservative communities coalesce. This article focuses on how identity journalism's discourse on migration manufactures racist subjectivities. Theoretically, it employs the notion of a 'chronotope': a discursive construct that fuses time and space and, in so doing, produces subjectivities. By bringing together spatialities implied in the concept of 'domopolitics' with the 'racialised temporalities' of critical race theory, the article conceptualises three distinct chronotopes of migration: the 'homeland', the 'extended home', and the '(racialised) outside'. Empirically, it studies how these chronotopes figure in a corpus extracted from two online identity-journalistic media: the Polish wPolityce.pl (110 articles) and the Czech ParlamentniListy.cz (189 articles). The results of a Foucauldian discourse analysis reveal, firstly, that by defining the 'homeland' as a spatially fixed entity that persists through time, identity journalism reinforces racist subjectivities by limiting the community of 'us' mainly to those who share the same past and, therefore, ethno-racial characteristics. Secondly, by projecting the spatially fixed but demographically diverse 'extended home' into the dystopian future, identity journalism buttresses the racist presumption of incompatibility between 'us' and 'them'. Finally, by casting the '(racialised) outside' as spatially mobile but temporally affixed to the uncivilised past, it feeds into the view of racialised migrants as barbaric and threatening.","[Polynczuk-Alenius, Kinga] Univ Helsinki, Helsinki Coll Adv Studies, PB 4 Fabianinkatu 24, Helsinki 00014, Finland; [Hartikainen, Ilana] Univ Helsinki, Fac Social Sci, Helsinki, Finland",University of Helsinki; University of Helsinki,"Polynczuk-Alenius, K (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Helsinki Coll Adv Studies, PB 4 Fabianinkatu 24, Helsinki 00014, Finland.",kinga.polynczuk@helsinki.fi,,"Polynczuk-Alenius, Kinga/0000-0001-6625-1409",,,,,48,0,0,0,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1177/14648849221126093,0.0,,Sep-22,19,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,4I1KC,,hybrid,,,2022/11/20,WOS:000850334300001,0

Drawing on a corpus of 30 pairs (of English and Spanish versions), I explore the strategies used by journalists in preparing the multimedia news story for its new audience. The methodology used combines comparative content analysis with a semi-standardised interview with the head of the International section of Eldiario.es. Translated news reports are respectful of the original written content from Theguardian.com but they replace multimedia content with other, different, content. The discursive effects of these substitutions are discussed and the reasons underlying these changes are analysed. The findings suggest that substitution of hypermedia content facilitates intercultural circulation of the multimedia journalistic narrative, but the modification of these contents on the part of the target medium produces its own range of effects.","[Hernandez Guerrero, Maria Jose] Univ Malaga, Translat, Malaga, Spain",Universidad de Malaga,"Guerrero, MJH (corresponding author), Univ Malaga, Fac Filosofia & Letras, Dept Traducc & Interpretat, Blvd Louis Pasteur 27, Malaga 29010, Spain.",mjhernandez@uma.es,,"Hernandez Guerrero, Maria Jose/0000-0003-1099-0602",,,,,44,0,0,14,26,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,JUL,2022.0,23.0,7,,,SI,,1488.0,1508.0,1.46E+16,10.1177/14648849221074517,0.0,,Mar-22,21,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,2E6BM,,,,,2022/11/20,WOS:000765431200001,0

It combines empirical data from the Israeli April 2019 elections with a conceptual view of exit polls as both sources of information and national rituals to address public discourse on the polls and its underlying suspicions. A multi-method approach yielded a corpus consisting of focus groups with citizens, in-depth semi-structured interviews with journalists, pollsters and experts, and qualitative textual analysis of news reports. Using inductive-qualitative analysis, we identified three types of public narratives, each casting blame for the erroneous exit poll projection on a different type of actor. The statistical and biased-media narratives tally with declining trust in the news media and assume misbehavior by pollsters and news creators respectively. The deception narrative, on the other hand, suggests that right-wing voters systematically sabotaged the exit poll projections. By extending trust beyond journalistic information, this narrative foregrounds the cultural meaning of election night rituals. Taken together, the narratives found in this study delineate (dis)trust as an interplay of active participants in the creation, reception, and interpretation of news. Our findings thus touch upon key attitudes towards both media and democracy and have implications for further studies on collective rituals and information evaluations in an era of eroding trust.","[Aharoni, Tali; Tenenboim-Weinblatt, Keren; Baden, Christian; Overbeck, Maximilian] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Commun & Journalism, Jerusalem, Israel",Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"Aharoni, T (corresponding author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Commun & Journalism, Jerusalem, Israel.",tali.aharoni@mail.huji.ac.il,"Baden, Christian/U-9165-2019","Baden, Christian/0000-0002-3771-3413; Aharoni, Tali/0000-0002-2138-8329; Overbeck, Maximilian/0000-0003-3658-5584",ERC [802990],ERC(European Research Council (ERC)European Commission),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study is funded by ERC Starting Grant 802990 (PROFECI).",,43,2,2,1,4,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,FEB,2022.0,23.0,2,,,,,337.0,353.0,1.46488E+15,10.1177/1464884920978105,0.0,,Dec-20,17,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,YP1AV,,"hybrid, Green Published",,,2022/11/20,WOS:000600910500001,0

The data consist of 10 thematic in-depth interviews with writers, owners and other key personnel from Finnish local communications operations applying journalistic practices in their content production, conceptualised here as interloper media practitioners. By applying the concept of boundary work, the study sheds light on the discursive contest over the forms and vocabulary of journalism and news media. The study also explores the ethical guidelines interloper media apply and how their representatives reflect on their ethical code of practice. The results are condensed into five rationales the practitioners use to justify the legitimacy of the interloper media outlets and the use of journalistic methods in strategic or commercial communications and civic information. The practitioners experience the boundaries between journalism and various types of communications as blurring. They borrow and apply journalistic styles and ethical guidelines selectively to lend their media attractivity and credibility. They face ethical conflicts in their work particularly regarding their relationship to power holders and decision-makers.

The same news environment that makes such reporting possible, however, can also facilitate a global cascade of journalistic errors. This article zooms in on the opportunities provided by a unique cluster of journalistic errors to understand factors influencing journalistic errors in international stories. It focuses on erroneous death reports of seven prominent North Koreans between 2012 and 2019. Existing research shows that domestic interests and ideology greatly influence international reporting, with journalists routinely relying heavily on elite sources. However, this article finds limited impact of national interests and political leanings, with the journalistic errors occurring across the ideological spectrum. News outlets developed a habit of quoting other - particularly international - sources without additional verification, citing lack of direct access to North Korea as a major reason. The clicks and revenue generated by salacious North Korea-related stories make them especially susceptible to distortion. Even after such stories were proven erroneous, corrections were rarely issued, with journalists conceding they do not think of North Korea as a subject worthy of clarification. This article thus concludes that in addition to national interest and the Cold War-era commercialization of fear, a culture of negative exceptionalism contributed to erroneous coverage, an idea that existing journalistic standards on ethics and fact-checking do not apply in dictatorial regimes like North Korea.","[Seo, Soomin] Temple Univ, Dept Journalism & Media, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA; [Seo, Soomin] Temple Univ, Commun Doctoral Program, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University,"Seo, S (corresponding author), Temple Univ, Dept Journalism, 2020 N 13th St, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA.",soomin.seo@temple.edu,,"Seo, Soomin/0000-0001-8095-6958",,,,,61,1,1,2,2,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,,,,,,,,,,,1.46E+16,10.1177/14648849221105924,0.0,,Jun-22,20,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,1Y7TQ,,,,,2022/11/20,WOS:000808342800001,0

Do the practices of different types of fact-checkers vary in these aspects? This study examines how professional and partisan fact-checkers deal with facticity during a protest movement in Hong Kong. The content analysis shows that partisan fact-checkers, when compared to professional fact-checkers, are less likely to restrict themselves to debunking factual claims, and they are more likely to provide no source information for the materials used. Posts addressing misleading claims, as opposed to factual claims, are where partisan inclinations are more clearly exhibited. Moreover, partisan fact-checkers used government information in ways consistent with their political predilection.

The study investigates the emotional labor - the work of managing one's emotions to keep others happy - that is required for journalists negotiating such harassment. Through qualitative interviews, our research shows that women in such roles face four main types of harassment: (1) disruptive in-person harassment, (2) physical and abrasive in-person harassment, (3) online harassment as unwanted sexual advances, and (4) online harassment as threats and criticisms. We find that women perform a significant degree of emotional labor as they regularly deal with harassment and simultaneously attempt to mitigate or prevent further harassment.","[Miller, Kaitlin C.] Univ Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Lewis, Seth C.] Univ Oregon, Sch Journalism & Commun, Emerging Media, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Lewis, Seth C.] Univ Oxford, Reuters Inst Study Journalism, Oxford, England",University of Oregon; University of Oregon; University of Oxford,"Miller, KC (corresponding author), Univ Oregon, Sch Journalism & Commun, Allen Hall,1275 Univ Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.",kbane@uoregon.edu,"Lewis, Seth/AAM-8847-2020","Lewis, Seth/0000-0001-7498-0599; Miller, Kaitlin/0000-0003-1368-0351",,,,,42,27,28,4,13,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,JAN,2022.0,23.0,1,,,,,79.0,97.0,1.46488E+15,10.1177/1464884919899016,0.0,,Feb-20,19,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,XW1QR,,,,,2022/11/20,WOS:000511094600001,0

It does so through a case study that examines how the Colombian news media reported on a particular figure during a peace negotiation: the 220,000 people who died because of the armed conflict in Colombia. The number was produced by the National Centre for Historical Memory in 2013 in a comprehensive report about the ravages of the Colombian conflict (1958-2012). Following a mix-method approach - a quantitative content analysis and a thematic analysis of the news articles - we find that the way in which journalists reported on the figure contradicts two key aspects of the report. While the report rejects an 'official memory' of the conflict for one that is more open to political and social debate, one characterised less by 'closed truths', the news reports treated the number as a fact and very rarely provided a form of contestation to it. Moreover, while the report emphasises the need for clarification over distortion and concealment when constructing memory, the news articles misrepresented those accountable for the casualties: Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC) was consistently positioned as the main illegal armed organisation responsible for the death toll. This representation ran counter to the findings from the report that emphasised the way paramilitary groups, rather than guerrilla groups (e.g. FARC), were more responsible for the killings. Considering our findings, we argue that an adherence to accuracy by journalists is more desirable than a practice of vagueness in the contribution to memory formation in post-conflict contexts.","[Ortega, Jose] Univ Leeds, Media & Commun Studies, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Lawson, Brendan] Loughborough Univ, Loughborough, Leics, England",University of Leeds; Loughborough University,"Ortega, J (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Sch Media & Commun, Clothworkers Bldg North, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",me17jdoc@leeds.ac.uk,,"Ortega, Jose/0000-0002-8144-9875",School of Media and Communication from the University of Leeds,School of Media and Communication from the University of Leeds,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: the corresponding author is under a scholarship funded by the School of Media and Communication from the University of Leeds as part of his Doctoral degree.",,58,0,0,3,4,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,,,,,,,,,,,1.46E+16,10.1177/14648849221075434,0.0,,Mar-22,22,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,ZT8KM,,hybrid,,,2022/11/20,WOS:000769399000001,0

They face barriers to integrating into the profession and the challenges of tokenism, but they also find sources of strength in their professional experience through the advantages of Ethiopian femininity and the opportunity to play advocacy roles. I argue that while their societal positioning renders them marginalized within dominant structures, it also allows them to confront oppressive dominant structures.

The author uses methods of intellectual history to construct the concept ofthe publicfrom Addams's books:Democracy and Social EthicsandThe Newer Ideals of Peace, showing that all three authors, Lippmann, Dewey and Addams, discuss the same topic of individuals' changed engagement with public political life. Addams departs from Lippmann and Dewey in setting out from the standpoints of exclusion and cosmopolitanism. Her argument regarding the public, as constructed by the author, consists of two premises. First, public engagement is a method of democratic inclusion as well as social and political inquiry for Addams. She sees the extension of relationality across social divisions as a necessary method to understand society and materialise democracy. Second, Addams emphasises cooperative and reflexive involvement especially in the characteristic developments of a time. She considers industrialisation and cosmopolitanism as characteristic developments of her own era. Addams suggests an in-principle cosmopolitan concept of the public that includes marginalised persons and groups. Compared to Lippmann's and Dewey's accounts of the public, Jane Addams's argument is more radical and far more sensitive to the social inequality and plurality of a drastically morphing society.","[Ripatti-Torniainen, Leena] Univ Helsinki, POB 54 Unioninkatu 37, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland",University of Helsinki,"Ripatti-Torniainen, L (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, POB 54 Unioninkatu 37, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",leena.ripatti-torniainen@helsinki.fi,"Ripatti-Torniainen, Leena/GWM-5245-2022",,,,,,45,0,0,1,4,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,JUN,2022.0,23.0,6,,,,,1285.0,1300.0,1.46488E+15,10.1177/1464884920958583,0.0,,Sep-20,16,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,1N8QT,,hybrid,,,2022/11/20,WOS:000573529100001,0

The corpus comprises 3831 articles published between 2000 and 2014. In addition, eight (semi-structured) interviews with German correspondents in Latin America were conducted to comprehend their relationship with the editorial offices and the indirect use of wire services.

However, further indicators show that the thematic orientation remains powerful.

More notably, the phenomenon can be explained by the motives participants attribute to journalists. Among bill supporters, perceiving the journalists to be advocating mediates the relationship between perceived news inaccuracy and news fakeness; whereas perceiving journalists to be defending the authorities mediates the same relationship among bill opponents.

Second, changes in the course of the pandemic-such as the introduction of vaccines- affect media attention.

Their battlefield accounts often reflect a biased understanding of the ideological confrontation of the two warring factions, referred to in Anglosaxon media as 'Loyalists' (Republicans) and 'Nationalists' (Francoists), whereas domestic reporters preferred the more categorical 'rojos' (reds) or 'fascistas' (fascists).

Drawing on a selection of historical, journalistic, media and translation studies research sources, as well as on a number of memoirs, personal accounts and biographies, in this article we discuss some up to now uncharted issues arising from the symbiotic connection between translation and journalism during the Spanish Civil War: (a) their lack of proficiency in Spanish and their unfamiliarity with the country made it necessary for many correspondents to rely on the assistance of interpreters, fixers, guides and press officers, recruited for their ideological commitment to the rebel military uprising or to the Republican Government; (b) the role of translation in the Press and Propaganda Offices set up by the incipient Nationalist government, the Spanish Republic and the Catalan and Basque autonomous governments; and (c) the complex relationship between foreign correspondents and translators working for the censorship departments set up by Francoist and Republican Press Offices in order to prevent journalists from revealing information which might undermine the morale of civilians or troops, and the international reception of the narratives they sought to disseminate abroad.","[Rodriguez-Espinosa, Marcos] Univ Malaga, Dept Translat & Interpreting, Malaga, Spain",Universidad de Malaga,"Rodriguez-Espinosa, M (corresponding author), Univ Malaga, Fac Filosofia & Letras, Dept Traducc & Interpretat, Blvd Louis Pasteur 27, Malaga 29010, Spain.",respinosa@uma.es,,"Rodriguez Espinosa, Marcos/0000-0001-8982-9293",,,,,58,0,0,1,3,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,JUL,2022.0,23.0,7,,,SI,,1567.0,1583.0,1.46E+16,10.1177/14648849221074554,0.0,,Feb-22,17,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,2E6BM,,,,,2022/11/20,WOS:000763575600001,0

Why then, do some people say they consume little to no news? The focus of this study is to identify the factors related to extremely low levels of news consumption. Survey data from a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults is used to test different explanations for news avoidance. Results point to several factors that explain lower overall levels of news consumption. Extremely low news consumption is related to a disinterest in politics, perceptions of news lacking relevance, low news self-efficacy and a lack of knowledge about the news system. Perhaps surprisingly, the emotional toll of news (e.g. news fatigue, upset feelings) did not explain variation in overall levels of news consumption. Based on these findings, efforts to convert news avoiders into more regular consumers of news is discussed.","[Edgerly, Stephanie] Northwestern Univ, Medill Sch Journalism, Evanston, IL USA",Northwestern University,"Edgerly, S (corresponding author), Northwestern Univ, 1870 Campus Dr, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",stephanie.edgerly@northwestern.edu,,"Edgerly, Stephanie/0000-0002-2934-0151",,,,,47,17,17,12,32,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,SEP,2022.0,23.0,9,,,,,1828.0,1845.0,1.46E+16,10.1177/14648849211012922,0.0,,Apr-21,18,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,4J9KJ,,,,,2022/11/20,WOS:000648348700001,0

Since audience orientation is important to the journalistic profession, it is important to know what different news audiences expect of journalists regarding their professional role and their reporting practices when it comes to media coverage of right-wing extremism. To bridge this research gap, by employing a quota sample representative of the general German population (n = 1314) and an independent sample of Muslims living in Germany (n = 248), we demonstrated that Muslims expect a more active role from journalists and even accept controversial reporting practices to combat right-wing extremism. More left-leaning individuals were found to expect more controversial reporting unless they were afraid of right-wing extremism. Among these more left individuals, fear of terrorism seems to activate the argument that a democratic society should not give up its core principles, including the professional autonomy of its journalists and ethical reporting practices.","[Baugut, Philip] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Media & Commun, Munich, Germany; [Scherr, Sebastian] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Commun, 4234 TAMU, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",University of Munich; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Scherr, S (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Dept Commun, 4234 TAMU, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",scherr@tamu.edu,,,LMUexcellent as part of LMU Munich's funding as University of Excellence,LMUexcellent as part of LMU Munich's funding as University of Excellence,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship and/or publication of this article: This research project/publication was supported by LMUexcellent as part of LMU Munich's funding as University of Excellence within the framework of the German Excellence Strategy.",,39,1,1,2,4,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,MAY,2022.0,23.0,5,,,,,973.0,991.0,1.46488E+15,10.1177/1464884921996307,0.0,,Feb-21,19,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,0R6XK,,,,,2022/11/20,WOS:000620762300001,0

The nine European minority languages are Basque, Welsh, Galician, Irish, Breton, Frisian, Sami, Corsican and Scottish-Gaelic. As for the findings, it can be highlighted that the economic volume or revenue of European minority language media is close to five hundred million euros per year, of which over ninety per cent is public funding, mostly devoted to broadcasting media.

As a result, studies on media narratives of infectious diseases have explored the issues of territoriality and national security by examining the discursive themes that undergird outbreak news. However, less is known about how these narratives are constructed through professional practice and the experience of those who create news. How journalists balance the interests of their local audience with the interconnected, interdependent aspects of these global events is the central question of this article. Interviewing journalists from the US, the UK, and South Korea who have reported on recent infectious disease outbreaks, I analyzed the news production of global outbreaks by examining the inner struggles, negotiations, and external forces that shape outbreak news. The findings suggest that journalistic practice in the context of global health crises is structured by tensions and contradictions: journalists conceptualize infectious diseases both as 'foreign' threats and 'shared' problems, try to find a balance between different value systems of newsworthiness such as cultural proximity and global outlook, and simultaneously internalize and resist the existing conventions of the 'outbreak narrative'.","[Kim, Youngrim] Univ Michigan, Dept Commun & Media, 105 South State St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Kim, Y (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Commun & Media, 105 South State St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",youngrim@umich.edu,,"KIM, Youngrim/0000-0001-7771-2872",,,,,48,5,5,0,4,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,JAN,2022.0,23.0,1,,,,,171.0,188.0,1.46488E+15,10.1177/1464884920940148,0.0,,Jul-20,18,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,XW1QR,,,,,2022/11/20,WOS:000546016000001,0

While this resulted in extensive media coverage, and naturally informed audiences about societal issues, it can also be problematic regarding the media's power to reflect and construct reality. Therefore, it is important to research how societal issues like sexual violence are discussed in media settings. The study aimed to investigate how journalists frame sexual violence in the news (RQ1) and whether such practices have changed in the wake of the MeToo movement (RQ2). A quantitative content analysis was conducted for news articles published in four US newspapers, spanning a period of 2 years - from 1 year before to 1 year after the #metoo tweet (N = 612; Oct. 2016 - Oct. 2018).

The letter speaks to how black British journalists are all too aware that the British journalistic field, like the American one, has a race problem, and institutional commitments to diversity often don't correspond with the experiences of those included, impacting negatively on the retention of black journalists. Drawing on original interviews with 26 journalists of colour who work for Britain's largest news organisations, this paper theoretically grounds empirical findings to illustrate why and how discriminatory patterns, as well as contradictions, occur and recur in British news production.","[Douglas, Omega] Goldsmiths Univ London, Media Commun & Cultural Studies, London, England",University of London; Goldsmiths University London,"Douglas, O (corresponding author), Goldsmiths Univ London, Dept Media Commun & Cultural Studies, London SE14 6NW, England.",Omega.Douglas@gold.ac.uk,,,Economic and Social Research Council,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"The author disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Initial research for this work was supported by the Economic and Social Research Council.",,49,2,2,0,4,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,OCT,2022.0,23.0,10,,,,,2096.0,2113.0,1.46E+16,10.1177/14648849211001778,0.0,,Mar-21,18,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,4Z0TO,,"Green Accepted, hybrid",,,2022/11/20,WOS:000628975200001,0

Findings reveal that citizen journalists' situated knowledge and expertise encourages humanizing Indigenous people, engenders media trust through evoking feelings of relatability and belonging, and strengthens Indigenous identity by foregrounding the focus on complex personhood.

For decades, empathy was seen as the antithesis of any kind of good journalism; that the journalist must at all times maintain detachment in order to do her job. But this paper interrogates, through the textual analysis of two Australian long form texts, including several epitextual artefacts, how empathy can perform as an evocative tool of narrative literary journalism creating richer and deeper meaning and depth of understanding. Both texts are hybrids of the form, mixing narrative inquiry, reportage and personal reflective practice. Here I argue that the first text conflates emotional and compassionate empathy, while the second privileges cognitive and radical empathy, ultimately and startlingly advocating compassionate empathy. Both provide for their audience an intimate glimpse into the private lives of others affected by trauma or occupying a particular place in cyberspace.","[Joseph, Sue] Univ Technol Sydney, 15 Broadway, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia",University of Technology Sydney,"Joseph, S (corresponding author), Univ Technol Sydney, 15 Broadway, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia.",Sue.Joseph@uts.edu.au,"Joseph, Sue/O-3834-2015","Joseph, Sue/0000-0003-4978-6633",,,,,17,1,1,1,9,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,MAY,2022.0,23.0,5,,,,,1082.0,1096.0,1.46488E+15,10.1177/1464884920949343,0.0,,Aug-20,15,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,0R6XK,,,,,2022/11/20,WOS:000557436200001,0

Based on two original datasets compiled for this study, the news media coverage of dozens of parties in a variety of offline and online news media sources since 1947 is analyzed to address the two research questions. In terms of visibility, new parties receive more attention when already represented in parliament and when mobilizing on the main axis of political contestation. In terms of framing, new parties are hardly ever trivialized, stigmatized, or criminalized. Compared to established parties, new parties are more trivialized, just as little criminalized, and even less stigmatized. Our findings put complaints about the media by new party leaders into perspective, and let political and media practitioners reflect on their practices, inform debates about interactions between news media and new voices.

This exploratory study investigates the impact of the pandemic on the practices of sports beat writers during the 2020 season. Through in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 12 beat writers covering teams in all four major North American sports leagues, this study reveals that the journalists' experiences with the pandemic-imposed conditions underscored already-present trends within sports journalism: namely, a reduction of access to players and coaching due, in part, to increased team control through robust media relations divisions; journalists' overreliance on official team sources; and a move towards feature and data- and analytics-driven stories. This study contributes to literature on sports journalism beat reporting and offers an early insight into how the pandemic conditions might help shape the future of the industry.","[Velloso, Carolina] Univ Maryland, Philip Merrill Coll Journalism, 7765 Alumni Dr, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Velloso, C (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Philip Merrill Coll Journalism, 7765 Alumni Dr, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",cvelloso@umd.edu,,"Velloso, Carolina/0000-0002-7674-6015",,,,,46,0,0,0,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1177/14648849221131725,0.0,,Oct-22,17,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,5C4CR,,Green Published,,,2022/11/20,WOS:000864210800001,0

But recent work has pointed towards a 'tabloidization' of news coverage, complicating the empirical distinction between the two. Computational methods for text analysis can help us better understand how distinct the news coverage between these two types of news outlets is. We take the Brexit referendum as a case study illustrating various aspects in which broadsheets and tabloids cover an issue permeated by othering and divisive rhetoric. We focus on Brexit-related news coverage before and after the referendum (N = 32,946) and use word embeddings to analyze the portrayal of different groups of citizens that can generate an in- and outgroup divide. First, we document the presence of media-based othering in the form of overly similar migrant and European Union citizen representations that are, in turn, very dissimilar to the UK citizen representation. Second, we show partial convergence between tabloid and broadsheet newspapers, as differences in the degree and characteristics of media coverage are rather small and specific.","[Walter, Stefanie] Tech Univ Munich, Sch Social Sci & Technol, Dept Governance, Munich, Germany; [Fazekas, Zoltan] Copenhagen Business Sch, Business & Polit, Dept Int Econ Govt & Business, Copenhagen, Denmark",Technical University of Munich; Copenhagen Business School,"Walter, S (corresponding author), Tech Univ Munich, Dept Governance, Richard Wagner Str 1, D-80333 Munich, Germany.",Stefanie.Walter@tum.de,,,,,,,49,0,0,2,2,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1177/14648849221116204,0.0,,Aug-22,19,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,3O3GP,,hybrid,,,2022/11/20,WOS:000836724000001,0

Concerns have been raised about news media's negative influence on mental health, increasing news avoidance, and decreasing trust in news. Constructive journalism is proposed to increase engagement with and trust in news media, reduce the mental health impact of news consumption, and provide a more accurate view of the world. However, constructive journalism studies primarily investigate the inclusion of solutions and positive emotions in news stories, to the exclusion of other techniques. Additionally, few studies have investigated constructive journalism's effects on trust and comprehension. We used a randomised-controlled repeated-measures experimental design to investigate the effects of a comprehensive set of constructive journalism techniques on mood, comprehension, and trust among 238 Australian participants. Participants who read constructive articles reported higher positive emotion, and lower negative emotion, compared to participants who read the same articles without constructive features. However, participants in the constructive condition demonstrated worse comprehension than participants in the control, an effect partially mediated by negative emotion but not effort. No significant differences in trust in journalism as an institution or in article content were present between groups. However, when accounting for interest, constructive journalism demonstrated a significant negative effect on trust in the information, though positive where it increased mood. Further research is needed to calibrate techniques which balance the positive effects of constructive journalism with its ability to convey information.","[van Antwerpen, Natasha; Searston, Rachel A.; Turnbull, Deborah] Univ Adelaide, Sch Psychol, Hughes North Terrace, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Hermans, Liesbeth] Windesheim Univ Appl Sci, Construct Journalism Media Res Ctr, Zwolle, Netherlands; [Kovacevic, Petra] Cardiff Sch Journalism Media & Cultural Studies, Journalism Studies, Cardiff, Wales",Flinders University South Australia; University of Adelaide; Cardiff University,"van Antwerpen, N (corresponding author), Univ Adelaide, Sch Psychol, Hughes North Terrace, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",natasha.vanantwerpen@adelaide.edu.au,"van Antwerpen, Natasha/GRJ-7286-2022","Hermans, Liesbeth/0000-0003-4986-9156; Kovacevic, Petra/0000-0003-1136-0573","Australian Government Department of Education, Skills and Employment Research Training Program (RTP) Scholarship","Australian Government Department of Education, Skills and Employment Research Training Program (RTP) Scholarship","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by an Australian Government Department of Education, Skills and Employment Research Training Program (RTP) Scholarship.",,57,0,0,18,18,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,,,,,,,,,,,1.46E+16,10.1177/14648849221105778,0.0,,May-22,24,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,1Y7TZ,,Green Accepted,,,2022/11/20,WOS:000808343700001,0

Such conceptual inconsistency is in tension with the relevance that the phenomenon of audience engagement has gained in contemporary discussions about journalism. In this article, we tackle the conceptual inconsistency of audience engagement by conducting a qualitative examination of all academic peer-reviewed publications (217) that dealt with 'audience engagement' and interrelated terms such as 'user engagement', 'news engagement' and 'engaged journalism', published between 2007 and 2018. Grounded in this empirical examination, we found that, first, definitions and operationalisations of audience engagement emphasised the production context of journalism over that of reception, yielding relatively unbalanced insights into the phenomenon. Second, we offer a Dynamic Model of Audience Engagement composed of four dimensions: normative, habitual, spatio-temporal and embodied. By grasping the complexity and multidimensionality of audience engagement and by aligning audience engagement with the notion with journalism's democratic goal of informing the citizenry and more concretely its audience, our Dynamic Model of Audience Engagement facilitates future academic discussions in and around the topic of audience engagement.","[Gajardo, Constanza; Meijer, Irene Costera] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Literature Language & Commun, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Gajardo, Constanza] Univ Concepcion, Dept Social Commun, Concepcion, Chile",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Universidad de Concepcion,"Gajardo, C (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Literature Language & Commun, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",constanza.gajardo@vu.nl,,"Gajardo Leon, Constanza/0000-0002-9329-8728","Becas Chile Scholarship Program, ANID, Chile [72180532]","Becas Chile Scholarship Program, ANID, Chile","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by Becas Chile Scholarship Program, ANID, Chile (grant no. 72180532).",,76,0,0,3,8,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,,,,,,,,,,,1.46E+16,10.1177/14648849221080356,0.0,,Apr-22,21,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,0G0BG,,hybrid,,,2022/11/20,WOS:000777719200001,0

The visibility of female reporters as authors in terms of sports coverage has been found to be under 10% in content analysis that spans several countries. Research into audiences' perceptions of authorship in sports journalism further found female authors to be prone to byline biases-even though findings are mixed. In this article, we set out to examine if the under representation of female sport authors has changed over the time span of 15 years. This is explored by conducting a content analysis of news coverage from 2006 to 2020 (Study 1). Further, we study whether biases against female authors in sports coverage (still) exist among recipients and in how far this is different for male and female sports. To address audience perceptions of gender in sport reporting, we performed an online experiment investigating the effect of female and male authorship as well as men's and women's football (soccer) as one of the most popular topic of sport reporting (Study 2). We found that female authorship in sports journalism is still marginalized without any significant improvement observed from 2006 to 2020 (Study 1). This contrasts with our findings on audiences' perceptions of male and female authors, which did not confirm a gender byline bias (Study 2). Our results therefore suggest that gender discrimination in newsrooms cannot be justified by audience perceptions.","[Boczek, Karin] Katholische Univ Eichstatt Ingolstadt, Digital Journalism, Eichstatt, Germany; [Dogruel, Leyla] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Media Syst & Media Performance, Mainz, Germany; [Schallhorn, Christiana] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Sociol Sport, Mainz, Germany",Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz; Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz,"Boczek, K (corresponding author), Katholische Univ Eichstatt Ingolstadt, Ostenstr 25, D-85072 Eichstatt, Germany.",karin.boczek@ku.de,,"Dogruel, Leyla/0000-0003-2701-3402; Schallhorn, Christiana/0000-0003-1564-2658",,,,,49,0,0,15,16,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,,,,,,,,,,,1.46E+16,10.1177/14648849211063312,0.0,,Jan-22,20,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,YR7JW,,hybrid,,,2022/11/20,WOS:000750170100001,0

This study examines the news organization in the non-West that has scored the most wins in international data journalism awards, Hong Kong's South China Morning Post, to discover characteristics of the data journalism it practices, as its media operates within an environment with increasing government monitoring of the press, similar to countries in the Asian region subjected to various forms of authoritarian politics. Through a content analysis of 130 data stories produced from 2016 to 2020, this study investigates the topics that SCMP's data team chooses to cover, how they are covered and the extent to which data journalism is able to work in the public's interest amid Hong Kong's increasingly complex political and social context. Findings show that even when stories are data-driven and evidence-based, with the use of diverse data sources and visualizations, topics related to China or Chinese politics tend to be approached with caution and the nature of stories more explanatory than investigative and less interactive. The roles of watchdog and interventionist are felt weakly in SCMP's data stories, and the role of loyal-facilitator felt more strongly for stories on China than those on Hong Kong and the world, suggesting that data journalism may face challenges performing its democratic functions.","[Wu, Shangyuan] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Commun & New Media, Fac Arts & Social Sci, AS6,11 Comp Dr, Singapore 117416, Singapore",National University of Singapore,"Wu, SY (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Commun & New Media, Fac Arts & Social Sci, AS6,11 Comp Dr, Singapore 117416, Singapore.",shanwu@nus.edu.sg,,"Wu, Shangyuan/0000-0003-3733-7988",Ministry of Education Academic Research Fund Tier 1 in Singapore [FY2019-FRC3-011],"Ministry of Education Academic Research Fund Tier 1 in Singapore(Ministry of Education, Singapore)","The author disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was funded by the Ministry of Education Academic Research Fund Tier 1 in Singapore (FY2019-FRC3-011).",,50,1,1,13,13,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,,,,,,,,,,,1.46E+16,10.1177/14648849221093509,0.0,,May-22,17,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,1N2AX,,,,,2022/11/20,WOS:000800465000001,0

With advertising revenues dwindling, news organizations have become increasingly dependent on reader revenue. This paper explores reasons news users have for not paying for (print and digital) news. 68 participants tried a free three-week newspaper trial subscription and afterward were interviewed about their considerations for (not) getting a paid subscription. Participants had four main reasons not to pay for news: price, sufficient freely available news, not wanting to commit oneself, and delivery and technical issues. A key finding is that digital entertainment subscriptions like Netflix and Spotify seemed central to how younger participants thought about paying for news. Another finding that stands out is that when referencing price, participants had a full print subscription in mind, even when their preferred subscription type was a less costly weekend-only or digital subscription. Participants also discussed future scenarios in which they might consider paying for news: a lower price, a flexible service, a one-stop for reliable news, the added value of higher quality news, and payment as a commitment device disciplining participants into actually reading the news.","[Kormelink, Tim Groot] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Language Literature & Commun, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Kormelink, TG (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Language Literature & Commun, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",t.grootkormelink@vu.nl,,"Groot Kormelink, Tim/0000-0001-5374-7536",,,,,35,1,1,1,1,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,,,,,,,,,,,1.46E+16,10.1177/14648849221099325,0.0,,May-22,19,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,1G3MJ,,hybrid,,,2022/11/20,WOS:000795754800001,0

In particular, objectivity must be critiqued for its role in the persistence of racism in liberal democratic journalism, a persistence that runs across different funding models and organizational structures. Objectivity, as a contested and flexible political concept, has proven incapable of addressing systemic racism. I argue that objectivity needs to be understood as an inherently political concept, which is as much proscriptive as descriptive in the way it shapes the field of journalism and the profession's relationship to political and social life. Rather than return to the safe ground of autonomy, truth and facts, professional, liberal journalism must recognize its foundations within racially unequal political and social structures.","[Budarick, John] Univ Adelaide, Dept Media, North Terrace, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia",University of Adelaide,"Budarick, J (corresponding author), Univ Adelaide, Dept Media, North Terrace, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",John.budarick@adelaide.edu.au,,,,,,,47,0,0,4,4,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,,,,,,,,,,,1.46E+16,10.1177/14648849221077747,0.0,,Mar-22,17,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,0A4QD,,,,,2022/11/20,WOS:000773939900001,0

Scholars have highlighted the role played by fixers in international news reporting, a role historically obscured in the mythos of the Western foreign correspondent. Recent research has produced useful insights about the work done by fixers in 'the shadows' of the international news economy. However, it has also tended towards a domestication of the role, where the local 'fixer' finds their place in a collaborative relationship with those officially consecrated as 'journalists' from elsewhere. This article presents a critical theoretical analysis of this functional role, building on the image of the fixer as a kind of 'entrepreneur'. Rather than interpreting the latter designation as a source of empowerment or agency, we approach it as a euphemism for the hyper-precarious and exploitative underpinnings of fixer-labour. Our argument draws on different theoretical sources, including Foucault-inspired work on the entrepreneurial rationality of the neoliberal self, Bourdieu's notion of symbolic violence, and Ranciere's concept of politics. The theoretical argument is supported by the first author's reflections of working as a Pakistani-based 'fixer' during the U.S-led war on terror.","[Ashraf, Syed, I] Univ Peshawar, Dept Journalism, Peshawar, Khyber Pakhtunk, Pakistan; [Phelan, Sean] Massey Univ, Sch Commun Journalism & Mkt, Palmerston North, New Zealand; [Phelan, Sean] Univ Antwerp, Dept Commun Studies, Antwerp, Belgium",University of Peshawar; Massey University; University of Antwerp,"Ashraf, SI (corresponding author), Univ Peshawar, Dept Journalism, Peshawar, Khyber Pakhtunk, Pakistan.;Phelan, S (corresponding author), Massey Univ, Sch Commun Journalism & Mkt, Palmerston North, New Zealand.;Phelan, S (corresponding author), Univ Antwerp, Dept Commun Studies, Antwerp, Belgium.",syedirfanashraf@gmail.com; s.phelan@massey.ac.nz,,"Phelan, Sean/0000-0002-6488-1703",,,,,34,0,0,3,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,,,,,,,,,,,1.46E+16,10.1177/14648849211065306,0.0,,Jan-22,17,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,YT5VL,,"Green Submitted, Green Accepted",,,2022/11/20,WOS:000751427100001,0

In doing so, it focuses on the motivations and identities of editors of what are variably known as community journalism outlets and hyperlocals. These outlets represent a growing sector which has filled the gap left behind by the closure and consolidation of local and regional newspapers. Many have been established over the past decade, frequently by journalists previously working for traditional media organisations. Drawing on insights from the field of social enterprise, the article shows that, like other social entrepreneurs, community journalists are driven by a range of motivations: Their decisions to start up new outlets are frequently informed by economic conditions, including gaps in the local news market. But more importantly, they also tend to be strongly influenced by normative ideals, including the desire to improve their communities through news provision. The distinctive articulation of these normative ideals demonstrates that local journalism entrepreneurs embody distinctive professional identities associated with conceptions of what constitutes good local journalism. These are tied to the provision of news which authentically captures the experience of the local community. Editors' origin stories reveal an emphasis on authority grounded in knowledge of, and a passionate attachment to, the local community.","[Wahl-Jorgensen, Karin] Cardiff Univ, Res Environm & Culture, Cardiff, Wales; [Wahl-Jorgensen, Karin] Cardiff Univ, Sch Journalism Media & Culture, Cardiff, Wales",Cardiff University; Cardiff University,"Wahl-Jorgensen, K (corresponding author), Cardiff Univ, Cardiff Sch Journalism Media & Culture, 2 Cent Sq, Cardiff CF10 3AT, Wales.",Wahl-jorgensenK@cardiff.ac.uk,,,British Academy [COV19302],British Academy,"The author disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the British Academy (COV19302).",,47,0,0,0,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1177/14648849221115223,0.0,,Nov-22,18,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,5Y2KS,,"Green Accepted, hybrid",,,2022/11/20,WOS:000879116900001,0

Second, an inductive manual framing analysis was conducted to distinguish the frames that both newspapers applied over time. Results from the topic modeling show that articles on AI and automation are most prominent within 'Work', 'Art', and 'Education'.

This paper explores how a First Amendment framework consisting of these two approaches breaks down in a networked communication ecosystem in which the lines between communicator and audience are increasingly blurred. The analysis explores these questions amid ongoing debates over regulating platforms and the possibility of increased public intervention in the floundering news industry. The paper builds on previous scholarship that has deemed First Amendment theory inadequate, incorporating the work of Mike Ananny, Joshua Braun, Victor Pickard, Phillip Napoli, and others. It argues that the current information system is too complex for a simple binary approach to First Amendment theory. Instead, it calls for a reflexive approach that embraces how these perspectives interrelate, one that calls for protecting the rights of speakers, but doing so in a way that characterizes them as members of a larger collective of listeners whose interests must be served.","[Walters, Patrick] Kutztown State Univ, Kutztown, PA 19530 USA",Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education (PASSHE); Kutztown University - Pennsylvania,"Walters, P (corresponding author), Kutztown State Univ, Dept English, 263 Lytle Hall,POB 730, Kutztown, PA 19530 USA.",pwalters@kutztown.edu,,"Walters, Patrick/0000-0003-2937-9571",,,,,82,0,0,0,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,,,,,,,,,,,1.46E+16,10.1177/14648849221074421,0.0,,Jan-22,18,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,ZL3KG,,,,,2022/11/20,WOS:000763576200001,0

This study expands its application to news reports on the China-US trade war-an inter-state conflict including a democratic and one-party dominant system-thereby adding an international dimension to the study of strategy framing. Through a manual content analysis of news coverage from China, the US, Singapore, and Ireland (from January 2013 to January 2020; n = 1872), we investigate whether media independence, conflict involvement, and crisis phases influence the employment of the issue framing and strategy framing. For democratic countries, the more involved they are in the conflict, the more prominent strategy framing was in their coverage of the trade conflict; the inverse was observed for one-party dominant systems. Strategy framing that considers countries as contenders is more prevalent than the sub-frame that focuses on individual politicians. The presence of national-versus-personal level strategy framing was more balanced for directly involved countries than indirectly involved countries since news from directly involved countries accords relatively more space to politicians' personal strategy.","[Liu, Shujun] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Journalism & Commun, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Boukes, Mark; De Swert, Knut] Univ Amsterdam, ASCoR, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Tsinghua University; University of Amsterdam,"Liu, SJ (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Sch Journalism & Commun, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",shujun-liu@outlook.com,"Boukes, Mark/K-5090-2014","Boukes, Mark/0000-0002-3377-6281; Liu, Shujun/0000-0002-9374-7036",,,,,42,0,0,2,11,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,,,,,,,,,,,1.46E+16,10.1177/14648849211052438,0.0,,Jan-22,23,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,YV5VQ,,,,,2022/11/20,WOS:000752796200001,0

Attention is paid to 'engendered' work in 'greedy' media organizations characterized by precarization of work and the related devaluation of journalism as a profession. Rather than detecting the extent of power and position of women in the media, we adopt the materialist analysis of mechanisms that mask gender inequality and contribute to 'capitalizing' on gender for the imperative of media productivity. The study was conducted in Slovenia, in Eastern European, post-socialist context, and comprised 33 individual interviews with media managers and workers at three television stations (public TV SLO, and commercial POP TV and Planet TV). In the analysis, we focus on how journalists, by internalizing the disciplining norms of 'entrepreneurial subjectivity', become the motivating force behind precarization of work. Although these processes are often perceived as gender neutral even among female journalists, we argue that they are masculinized and have different effects on men and women, among other things due to the individualization of women's reproductive roles.","[Pajnik, Mojca] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Social Sci, Dept Media & Commun, Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Hrzenjak, Majda] Peace Inst, Ljubljana, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana,"Pajnik, M (corresponding author), Univ Ljubljana, Fac Social Sci, Kardeljeva Ploscad 5, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia.",mojca.pajnik@fdv.uni-lj.si,,"Pajnik, Mojca/0000-0001-5089-1559","Slovenian Research Agency [P5-0413, J5-7095]",Slovenian Research Agency(Slovenian Research Agency - Slovenia),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship and/or publication of this article: This research work was conducted as part of the research programme of the Peace Institute Equality and Human Rights in Times of Global Governance, P5-0413, financed by the Slovenian Research Agency, 2020-2023, and the basic research project Gender Differentiation in Media Industry, J5-7095, financed by the same agency, 2016-2018.",,42,3,3,0,6,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,FEB,2022.0,23.0,2,,,,,499.0,516.0,1.46488E+15,10.1177/1464884920922075,0.0,,May-20,18,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,YP1AV,,hybrid,,,2022/11/20,WOS:000536532000001,0

Qualitative interviews with 32 German and 34 British journalists reveal important similarities but also differences between the two countries. Specifically, in both countries journalists reported primarily relying on their psychological capital to deal with emotional labour, although many were unsure what exactly constitutes it or how it has been developed. In Germany the social and supervisor support were often mentioned as effective, while in the UK social support was at times found to be hindered by newsroom culture and supervisors' lack of understanding of the job pressures. Finally, it has been suggested by journalists in both countries that organisational support could be improved by an offer of training in emotional literacy for both journalists and managers, establishment of a point of contact tasked with pastoral care, and fair, transparent and formal structures that encourage and enable journalists to effectively deal with emotional stressors in the job.","[Simunjak, Maja] Middlesex Univ London, Dept Media, London NW4 4BT, England; [Menke, Manuel] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Commun, Copenhagen, Denmark",Middlesex University; University of Copenhagen,"Simunjak, M (corresponding author), Middlesex Univ London, Dept Media, London NW4 4BT, England.",M.Simunjak@mdx.ac.uk,,"Menke, Manuel/0000-0002-4215-3713",Arts and Humanities Research Council [AH/V00543X/1],Arts and Humanities Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC)),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the Arts and Humanities Research Council under Grant AH/V00543X/1.",,51,0,0,6,6,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1177/14648849221115205,0.0,,Jul-22,19,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,2X2PK,,"hybrid, Green Accepted",,,2022/11/20,WOS:000825051600001,0

For that reason, they often collaborate to bring incriminating information to public knowledge. In the standard account, the whistleblower initiates the contact to journalists who eventually publish the story. Based on a sample of 16 whistleblower cases, the paper shows that the reality of this relationship is more complex than the standard account suggests. The empirical material documents four different trajectories through which whistleblower information reaches the public sphere, only one of which conforms to the standard account. The paper explains the variation based on a theoretical framework, which highlights the main similarities and differences between whistleblowers and journalists. Seen from the perspective of whistleblowers the relationship is double-sided. On the one hand, engaging with the press entails considerable asymmetry and uncertainty for whistleblowers who do not always know the exact motives of journalists just as they enter the relationship from a much more precarious and unstable position. Whistleblowers are also wary of collaborating with the press because it entails a radical loss of privacy as the story breaks in the public sphere. On the other hand, interacting with the press can offer vital legitimacy, protection, and professional resources for vulnerable whistleblowers. Existing work on this core relationship in democracy is surprisingly small and undertheorized. The paper contributes to the debate by offering a theoretically and empirically grounded typology of the whistleblower-journalism nexus.","[Olesen, Thomas] Aarhus Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Bartholins Alle 7, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark",Aarhus University,"Olesen, T (corresponding author), Aarhus Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Bartholins Alle 7, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.",tho@ps.au.dk,,,,,,,56,0,0,1,1,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,,,,,,,,,,,1.46E+16,10.1177/14648849221109046,0.0,,Jun-22,18,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,2E1HP,,,,,2022/11/20,WOS:000811984800001,0

In that light, this study sets out to analyse the discourses of fake news as advanced by states. Results from a critical discourse analysis of articles relating to fake news (n = 450) from four countries - Cambodia, Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam - reveal four key findings: first, fake news is being framed as an existential security issue that directly threatens foundational societal values. Second, fake news as an issue is constructed as a new and unprecedented contemporary problem, and compared on equal terms to other security threats such as terrorism, chemical attacks and cyberwarfare. Third, the threat of fake news is used to justify the passing of broad-reaching legislation and curbs on free speech that are construed as aligned with global democratic norms. Lastly, the term is used to facilitate unsubstantiated 'lying press' accusations against media outlets. Overall, this study suggests that fake news can be damaging to the quality of democracies not only as a result of its dissemination, but also through the discursive instrumentalisation of the term to curb civil liberties and justify crackdowns.","[Neo, Ric] Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",University of Hong Kong,"Neo, R (corresponding author), Univ Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",ricneo@hku.hk,,"Neo, Ric/0000-0002-6418-4350",,,,,70,3,3,2,15,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,SEP,2022.0,23.0,9,,,,,1919.0,1938.0,1.46488E+15,10.1177/1464884920984060,0.0,,Dec-20,20,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,4J9KJ,,,,,2022/11/20,WOS:000610286400001,0

However, the scholarly literature has focused primarily on normative considerations, without providing much empirical data that could confirm what are widely assumed to be the positive effects of transparency. In this paper, I argue, first, thateditorial texts, in their various manifestations, are the most potent of the various established means of displaying transparency for opening up the production of news item. However, I then draw on my linguistic, process-focused research onquotingand highlight challenges this process creates for the use of editorial texts in the pursuit of transparency. It turns out that conveying the essentials of decision-making that occurs during newswriting requires profound understanding and awareness of the interplay between modalities, co-texts and contexts of language use. Finally, implementing the norm of transparency has allegedly led to the transformation of a well-intentioned goal intoan institutional myth, leading journalists - constrained, for example, by the mechanism ofimpression management- to disclose only socially acceptable practices. Therefore, I conclude by arguing for transdisciplinary research in which scholars research 'on, for and with' (Perrin, 2018) other stakeholders in order to bring about a fundamental change in the culture of transparency in journalism.","[Haapanen, Lauri] Univ Jyvaskyla, POB 35, FI-40014 Jyvaskyla, Finland",University of Jyvaskyla,"Haapanen, L (corresponding author), Univ Jyvaskyla, POB 35, FI-40014 Jyvaskyla, Finland.",lauri.m.haapanen@jyu.fi,,,,,,,53,2,2,6,12,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,APR,2022.0,23.0,4,,,,,875.0,891.0,1.46488E+15,10.1177/1464884920934236,0.0,,Jun-20,17,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,0M3LB,,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2022/11/20,WOS:000542276200001,0

This essay highlights key insights from activities of the human rights and civic journalism network WITNESS, as they seek to prepare for new forms of media manipulation, such as deepfakes, and to ensure that an emergent authenticity infrastructure is in place to respond to global needs for reliable information without creating additional harms. Based on global consultations on perceived threats and prioritized solutions, their efforts are primarily targeted towards synthetic media and deepfakes, which not only facilitate audiovisual falsification (including non-consensual sexual images) but also, by being embedded in societal dynamics of surveillance and civil society suppression, they challenge real footage and so undermine the credibility of civic media and frontline witnessing (also known as liar's dividend). They do this within a global context where journalists and some distant witness investigators self-identify as lacking relevant skills and capacity, and face inequity in access to detection technologies. Within this context, authenticity infrastructure tracks media provenance, integrity, and manipulation from camera to edit to distribution, and so comes to provide verification subsidies that enable distant witnesses to properly interpret eye-witness footage. This authenticity infrastructure and related tools are rapidly moving from niche to mainstream in the form of initiatives the Content Authenticity Initiative and Coalition for Content Authenticity and Provenance, raising key questions about who participates in the production and dissemination of audiovisual information, under what circumstances and to which effect for whom. Provenance risks being weaponized unless key concerns are integrated into infrastructure proposals and implementation. Data may be used against vulnerable witnesses, or the absence of a trail, for legitimate privacy and technological access reasons, used to undermine credibility. Regulatory and extra-legal co-option are also a fear as securitized fake news laws proliferate. The investigation of both phenomena, deepfakes and emergent authenticity infrastructure(s), this paper argues, is important as it highlights the risks related both to the information disorder of deepfakes as they challenge the credibility and safety of frontline witnesses and to responses to such disorder, as they risk worsening inequities in access to tools for mitigation or increasing exposure to harms from technology infrastructure.","[Gregory, Sam] WITNESS, 80 Hanson Pl, Brooklyn, NY 11217 USA",,"Gregory, S (corresponding author), WITNESS, 80 Hanson Pl, Brooklyn, NY 11217 USA.",sam@witness.org,,,,,,,78,0,0,10,24,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,MAR,2022.0,23.0,3,,,SI,,708.0,729.0,1.46E+16,10.1177/14648849211060644,0.0,,Dec-21,22,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,ZO6IV,,,,,2022/11/20,WOS:000730792200001,0

By channeling capital into sustainable investments, it is hoped that finance can accelerate the transition towards a greener and more sustainable future. However, given that the discussion about SF lacks consistency and a common understanding of SF, the role of financial journalists in reporting about this trend and in enacting their role as watchdogs becomes of paramount interest. To do so, 33 semi-structured interviews with journalists who have covered SF in six countries (AT, BE, CH, DE, NL, UK) were conducted to find out about journalistic role perceptions and daily journalistic practices (such as sources, style of writing and role of the audience). Findings show that journalists mainly enact the role of a chronicler, informant and educator when writing about SF, but fail to fulfil an active watchdog role. Furthermore, the coverage of SF is predominately event-driven, directed at a financial elite, and has become highly professionalized at financial news outlets. Given the urgency of the climate crisis, journalists reported that they found themselves in a moral dilemma between enacting their professional role as a journalist on the one hand and providing a platform for unsubstantiated claims about SF (greenwashing) made by the industry, on the other hand.","[Strauss, Nadine] Univ Oxford, Oxford, England",University of Oxford,"Strauss, N (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Oxford Sustainable Finance Programme, Smith Sch Enterprise & Environm, South Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England.",nadine.strauss@smithschool.ox.ac.uk,"Strauss, Nadine/GRJ-4938-2022","Strauss, Nadine/0000-0002-5050-7067",European Union [834638],European Union(European Commission),"The author disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship and/or publication of this article: This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement no. 834638.",,42,5,5,3,22,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,JUN,2022.0,23.0,6,,,,,1194.0,1212.0,1.46E+16,10.1177/14648849211001784,0.0,,Mar-21,19,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,1N8QT,,"hybrid, Green Published",,,2022/11/20,WOS:000628929300001,0

Despite a growing body of research, however, two main issues remain currently unexplored: (1) the extent to which engaged journalism as a practice aligns with engaged journalism as a theoretical construct, and (2) the extent to which the audience assumptions underlying the pursuit of engaged journalism align with actual audience expectations and desires. This paper begins to address both of these issues by comparing how advocates of engaged journalism conceptualize the public's interest in participating in journalism with observations of actual instances of that participation. We find that there is indeed a gap between engaged journalism theory and practice, which we attribute to a distinction between what engaged journalists believe audiences want from news and how those audiences actually behave. At the same time, we also find that institutional rigidity in newsrooms that leads to some reluctance with regard to making news production more collaborative.","[Schmidt, Thomas R.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Commun, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Nelson, Jacob L.] Arizona State Univ, Walter Cronkite Sch Journalism & Mass Commun, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Lawrence, Regina G.] Univ Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; University of Oregon,"Schmidt, TR (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",tlschmidt@ucsd.edu,,"Schmidt, Thomas R./0000-0002-4497-9180",,,,,38,7,7,4,11,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,JAN,2022.0,23.0,1,,,,,3.0,21.0,1.46488E+15,10.1177/1464884920934246,0.0,,Jun-20,19,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,XW1QR,,,,,2022/11/20,WOS:000544378700001,0

The article is structured as follows. First, it surveys the concepts of gatekeeping and ideological affinity with regard to news translation. Then a research question concerning the reporting of the Catalan secessionist crisis in Spain is presented. This will serve to examine how translation functions as a gatekeeping mechanism. The corpus selected for the analysis comprises the Spanish articles and English versions posted byEl Paisin the 3 months prior and the 3 months posterior to the simultaneous appointments of Spain's new Prime Minister and of the new editor ofEl Pais. This coincidence constitutes a unique opportunity to delve into the relationship between translation and gatekeeping. The findings show that the ideological affinity between the political leader and the editor may have prompted a significant change in the way the Catalan crisis was reported, particularly in the translated versions.","[Valdeon, Roberto A.] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Valdeon, Roberto A.] Univ Oviedo, English Studies, Oviedo, Spain; [Valdeon, Roberto A.] Univ Free State, Bloemfontein, South Africa",Huazhong University of Science & Technology; University of Oviedo; University of the Free State,"Valdeon, RA (corresponding author), Univ Oviedo, Oviedo 33003, Spain.",valdeon@uniovi.es,"Valdeon-Garcia, Roberto Antonio/M-6744-2013","Valdeon-Garcia, Roberto Antonio/0000-0003-1948-0473",,,,,40,13,13,3,31,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,JAN,2022.0,23.0,1,,,,,117.0,133.0,1.46488E+15,10.1177/1464884920917296,0.0,,Jun-20,17,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,XW1QR,,,,,2022/11/20,WOS:000540052700001,0

This article furthermore investigates how Dutch arts journalists shaped and responded to this new narrative through an analysis of relevant media reviews and reports. The resulting discourse reflected how the Fries Museum's use of artefacts created a narrative of Mata Hari which could comment on the broader challenges for women in early twentieth century Europe. We argue that the exhibition and its reportage built upon and reflected advances in recent historiography to offer a fresh perspective on Mata Hari. Moreover, the review analysis suggests that the exhibition successfully balanced seemingly paradoxical needs, as set out in its prospectus, through the creation of such nuanced narratives.","[Wheelwright, Julie] Birkbeck Univ London, Dept Hist Class & Archaeol, London, England; [Ummels, Adrienne] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Nijmegen, Netherlands",University of London; Birkbeck University London; Radboud University Nijmegen,"Wheelwright, J (corresponding author), Univ London, Birkbeck Coll, Malet St, London WC1E 7HX, England.",j.wheelwright@bbk.ac.uk,,,,,,,54,0,0,0,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1177/14648849221100921,0.0,,Jul-22,18,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,2W8VE,,hybrid,,,2022/11/20,WOS:000824794900001,0

This qualitative study uses in-depth interviews to explore the roles of meta-level organizations in relation to the troubles of local journalism, how these roles are enacted at professional association conferences, and how they are conceptualized by journalists and representatives of meta-level organizations. We found evidence of three traditional roles of meta-level organizations - information, interaction, existential roles - across different types of meta-level organizations. Respondents tended to view these roles through a lens of resource scarcity. We also found evidence of the role of self-maintenance-i.e., meta-level organizations have their own institutional spaces and an interest in self-preservation-as well as the role of conceptualization or theorization, of innovations, and an emergent role of translation.

While nearly all participants had to resort to work outside journalism in 2020, at least half still displayed strong links to journalism, demonstrated by their sense of belonging to a community of journalists, and their continued interest in doing self-funded public interest journalism as 'passion projects'. However, we also noticed a blurring between the descriptors of journalist and writer, based partly on employment opportunities but also, importantly, on interest in increasing creativity in the journalistic space.

The analysis revealed two mechanisms of mutual monitoring: (a) direct monitoring at protest sites and (b) monitoring published works.

Alongside the importance of reception, this paper advocates for conceptualizing trust not solely as a response to news, but as a key component in the infrastructure that makes news possible. Through an exploration of the role of trust at every stage of the newsmaking process, we argue that trust structures and underpins news funding, production, circulation, and audience measurement. Expanding the conceptual framework through which trust is assessed to consider its infrastructural role affords greater clarity on the consequences of distrust in news. We highlight future research directions and areas of inquiry made possible by theorizing trust in news in this way.","[Rachel, Elizabeth] Univ Washington, Informat Sch, Seattle, WA 98105 USA; [Efrat, Nechushtai] George Washington Univ, Washington, DC USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; George Washington University,"Rachel, E (corresponding author), Care Of Moran R, Univ Washington, Ctr Informed Publ, Seattle, WA 98105 USA.",,,,John S. and James L.

This model assumes that journalists play a positive part in democracy by monitoring those with power and facilitating a diverse marketplace of ideas. Within this model, journalistic professionalism emphasises objectivity, neutrality, pluralism, balance and independence. There are, however, two types of advocacy journalism which, despite receiving less attention, nonetheless are present in Western media and exhibit characteristics contrary to these liberal values: radical journalism and collaboration between journalists and the state. Through a case study comparing Australian Murdoch media coverage of an industrial dispute to that of non-Murdoch media, this paper proposes a third type of advocacy journalism: conservative advocacy. Through the development of a model of journalistic influence on democracy, conservative advocacy is proposed as the least democratic form of journalism due to its suppression of voices that challenge power.","[Fielding, Victoria] Univ Adelaide, Commun Media & Journalism, Adelaide, SA, Australia",University of Adelaide,"Fielding, V (corresponding author), Univ Adelaide, North Terrace, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",Victoria.Fielding@adelaide.edu.au,,"Fielding, Victoria/0000-0001-5426-988X",,,,,68,0,0,2,2,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,,,,,,,,,,,1.46E+16,10.1177/14648849211072717,0.0,,Jan-22,19,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,ZL3KJ,,,,,2022/11/20,WOS:000763576500001,0

This also applies to content that is directed at journalists or published on journalistic platforms. So-called 'dark participation' in online communication is a challenge that journalists have to face because it lowers users' perceived credibility of media brands and hinders a deliberative discourse in comment sections. This study examines how journalists perceive themselves in relation to dark participation, what measures they take against it, and how they assess the efficacy of these measures. Based on in-depth interviews (N = 26), we find that journalists overall considered themselves to be effective in handling dark participation. The perceived efficacy differed according to the grade of engagement with users. Journalists who interacted very much or very little with users perceive the efficacy of their interventions to be highest, whilst those with medium levels of interaction rate their efficacy to be lower.

Study 2 found that factors connected to prominence, relatedness, and conflict, predicted the use of specific frames. Prominence (Specifically GDP) increased the use of the economic frame and decreased the conflict one.

Through a process of platformization-the subjugation of news production to social media logic-these platforms are reshaping journalists' and social-media editors' conceptions regarding audience, its role in news production, and its expectations vis-a-vis the newsroom. These beliefs translate into news professionals' everyday practices as concerns contact with audiences, and ultimately influence news production. Based on interviews with 18 social-media editors and 24 journalists, the study demonstrates how each of the above relational aspects has been modified in line with social media's economic, governmental and infrastructural logic.

Via analysis of 67 interviews with journalists and protection actors, this article shows how many reporters use journalistic and profession-specific forms of self-protection and analyses their benefits and challenges. It adopts a novel analytical approach building on insights from diverse areas of research on people's responses to violence and insecurity. Scholarship on civilian responses to armed conflict offers a relevant framework for understanding self-protection measures. Although measures such as avoidance and accommodation of violent actors are a means of survival and short-term physical protection, they bring significant new risks. Above all, they can undermine trust from the public and within the profession and the usefulness of journalism for society. Drawing on literature on the protection of human rights defenders, the analytical framework is extended to show how some journalists also engage in broader self-protection strategies around transforming their work. These strategies combine protection and professionalisation and aim to boost journalists' internal and external support and credibility.","[Mitchell, Tamsin S.] Univ York, Ctr Appl Human Rights, York, N Yorkshire, England",University of York - UK,"Mitchell, TS (corresponding author), Univ York, Ctr Appl Human Rights, York, N Yorkshire, England.",tamsin.s.mitchell@gmail.com,,,Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC),Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),This study was supported by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC).,,61,0,0,4,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1461-670X,1469-9699,,JOURNALISM STUD,Journal.

Ultimately, judges have constructed a discourse about journalism that combined concerns regarding how closely the process and practices the publishers used to gather and communicate the information aligned with traditional journalistic work, the public-service value of the information, and the journalistic credentials of the publisher. Though concern for how the work was created and who communicated it was crucial, jurists consistently conveyed the public-service role was most instrumental in their evaluations, often rationalizing broad expansions of what legally constitutes journalism.","[Schroeder, Jared] Southern Methodist Univ, Meadows Sch Arts, Div Journalism, Dallas, TX 75205 USA",Southern Methodist University,"Schroeder, J (corresponding author), Southern Methodist Univ, Meadows Sch Arts, Div Journalism, Dallas, TX 75205 USA.",jcschroeder@smu.edu,,,,,,,45,0,0,1,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1461-670X,1469-9699,,JOURNALISM STUD,Journal.

One response to geographic disparities in knowledge production has been to encourage more special issues that focus on the Global South. These calls are based on a belief that special issues provide a more welcoming venue for Global South research and scholars. Our study tests this proposition by examining whether and how the geographic representation of authorship differs between articles published in special issues and those published through general calls. We examine this through a content analysis of more than 4,000 articles published in five highly ranked journalism studies journals. Our findings reveal that special issues with a geographic focus on the Global South and global perspectives broadly lead to a more geographically diverse group of authors. At the same time, themed issues with a global or Global South focus are rare, and publications in these issues receive far fewer citations. Overall, these findings indicate that while special issues provide greater publishing opportunities for scholars from the Global South, enduring biases in the field limit their impact.","[Ekdale, Brian; Biddle, Katy; Tully, Melissa] Univ Iowa, Sch Journalism & Mass Commun, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Asuman, Manfred] Nelson Mandela Univ, Sch Journalism Media & Philosophy, Gqeberha, South Africa; [Rinaldi, Abby] North Carolina State Univ USA, Commun Rhetor & Digital Media, Raleigh, NC USA",University of Iowa; Nelson Mandela University,"Ekdale, B (corresponding author), Univ Iowa, Sch Journalism & Mass Commun, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.",brian-ekdale@uiowa.edu,,"Ekdale, Brian/0000-0001-6203-0895; Tully, Melissa/0000-0003-1850-3477",Obermann Center for Advanced Studies at the University of Iowa,Obermann Center for Advanced Studies at the University of Iowa,"The authors wish to thank the Obermann Center for Advanced Studies at the University of Iowa.

More than half of the respondents answered that suicides should be reported to raise people's awareness of warning signs and encourage public debate, mirroring the view of professionals from other countries. Almost 60% stated not knowing the guidelines for responsible suicide reporting. This study, which surveyed the largest sample of journalists ever to be questioned about suicide reporting, shows that there has been a change in Portuguese journalism practices in that regard and indicates that the topic should be included in education and/or training.","[Ribeiro, Eudora; Granado, Antonio] Univ Nova Lisboa, ICNOVA Inst Comunicacao NOVA, Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade Nova de Lisboa,"Ribeiro, E (corresponding author), Univ Nova Lisboa, ICNOVA Inst Comunicacao NOVA, Lisbon, Portugal.",eudora.ribeiro@campus.fcsh.unl.pt,,"Ribeiro, Eudora/0000-0002-9796-9672; Granado, Antonio/0000-0002-7990-6176","FCT - Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia [SFRH/BD/143780/2019, UIDB/05021/2020]",FCT - Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia(Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology),This work was supported by the FCT - Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia [grant number: SFRH/BD/143780/2019 and UIDB/05021/2020].,,66,0,0,2,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1461-670X,1469-9699,,JOURNALISM STUD,Journal.

In doing so, we discuss how ubuntu combats colonialism and apartheid to enable individuals to become the most that they can be. In this regard, we see decolonial journalism advancing freedom of expression under conditions that enable truth in the public good to emerge, thus challenging the widely purveyed view that freedom of expression or dissent is alien to the African cultural fabric. Indeed, while holding that decolonial journalism is part of the co-creation of communicative spheres that are marked by freedom, justice and dignity, we acknowledge that a decolonial African journalism is capacious enough to express contending perspectives and to serve goals that empower individuals and communities with truths that enable them to meet their needs in ever-changing circumstances.","[Chasi, Colin] Univ Free State, Unit Inst Change & Social Justice, Bloemfontein, South Africa; [Rodny-Gumede, Ylva] Univ Johannesburg, Dept Journalism Film & Televis, Johannesburg, South Africa",University of the Free State; University of Johannesburg,"Rodny-Gumede, Y (corresponding author), Univ Johannesburg, Dept Journalism Film & Televis, Johannesburg, South Africa.",yrodny-gumede@uj.ac.za,,,,,,,47,0,0,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1461-670X,1469-9699,,JOURNALISM STUD,Journal.

Previous research has mainly focused on the analysis of moderation strategies in dealing with such comments. In contrast, little attention was paid to the issue of which comments are considered problematic by content moderators in the first place. The answer to this question has more than theoretical relevance, but practical significance against the backdrop of increasing efforts to automate the detection of hate speech or toxicity in user comments. Based on 20 interviews, this paper explores what comment moderators in Germany consider to be hate comments, how they moderate them, and how differences in moderation practices can be explained. Our findings show strong agreement regarding extreme cases of hate comments, whereby there is overlap with the theoretical concept of hate speech, but also forms of incivility. Moreover, the interviews revealed differences in the perception and handling of hate comments, which can be linked to explanatory factors at the levels of the individual, professional routines, and the organization.","[Paasch-Colberg, Sunje; Strippel, Christian] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Media & Commun Studies, Berlin, Germany; [Paasch-Colberg, Sunje] DeZIM, German Ctr Integrat & Migrat Res, Berlin, Germany; [Strippel, Christian] Weizenbaum Inst Networked Soc, Berlin, Germany",Free University of Berlin,"Paasch-Colberg, S (corresponding author), Free Univ Berlin, Inst Media & Commun Studies, Berlin, Germany.",s.colberg@fu-berlin.de,,"Strippel, Christian/0000-0002-7465-4918",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research [01UG1735AX],German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"This research is part of the project NOHATE-Overcoming crises in public communication about refugees, migration, foreigners, funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research [grant number: 01UG1735AX].",,50,0,0,1,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1461-670X,1469-9699,,JOURNALISM STUD,Journal.

Further, perceived news importance and news efficacy positively moderate the association, by increasing the probability of click-through. To the contrary, the news-finds-me perception negatively moderates the association, by decreasing the probability of click-through of the linked full story.

To improve detection accuracy, it is necessary to understand not only malicious comments but also malicious commenters. Despite the importance of understanding malicious commenters, there is little empirical research on their characteristics. This study aims to understand the characteristics of malicious commenters and develop a prediction model based on their features using real data of users and commenting activities from Naver, a leading Internet news portal in Korea. This study found that the demographic characteristics of malicious commenters tend to be those of males and older people. In terms of commenting activities, the online news commenters who leave more comments per news article and per day, delete more comments, and leave longer comments tend to be malicious commenters.","[Baek, Hyunmi; Kim, Seongcheol] Korea Univ, Sch Media & Commun, Seoul, South Korea; [Jang, Moonkyoung] Gachon Univ, Coll Business, Seongnam, South Korea",Korea University; Gachon University,"Kim, S (corresponding author), Korea Univ, Sch Media & Commun, Seoul, South Korea.",hiddentrees@korea.ac.kr,,"Jang, Moonkyoung/0000-0003-3264-7215",Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea; National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF2019S1A3A2099973]; MSIT (Ministry of Science and ICT) Korea under the ITRC (Information Technology Research Center) support program [IITP2020-0-01749],"Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea); MSIT (Ministry of Science and ICT) Korea under the ITRC (Information Technology Research Center) support program(Ministry of Science & ICT (MSIT), Republic of KoreaMinistry of Science, ICT & Future Planning, Republic of Korea)","This work was supported by the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea, the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF2019S1A3A2099973), and the MSIT (Ministry of Science and ICT) Korea, under the ITRC (Information Technology Research Center) support program (IITP2020-0-01749) supervised by the IITP (Institute of Information & Communications Technology Planning & Evaluation).",,49,0,0,5,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1461-670X,1469-9699,,JOURNALISM STUD,Journal.

Drawing from 22 in-depth interviews with Dutch young people (19-36), we found four successive phases in which participants used and made sense of news in distinct ways. First, before the virus reached the Netherlands, they saw it as a problem far away and felt indifferent toward the news. During the second phase of shock, as COVID-19 reached the Netherlands, news use increased as participants frantically tried to make sense of the situation. Third, participants experienced Corona-fatigue due to informational and emotional overload and began dosing their intake of news. Finally, they became used to the new normal and returned to (perceived) regular levels of news consumption. Two new rituals stood out during the first wave: press conferences seemingly interpellated participants as Dutch citizens who should take their responsibility, and daily updates of COVID-19 cases were used as a gauge for how we were doing. Overall, participants' position could best be described as critical-but-pragmatic: even if they questioned the veracity of some news, they chose to follow measures to curtail the virus.","[Kormelink, Tim Groot; Gunnewiek, Anne Klein] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Language Literature & Commun, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Kormelink, TG (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Language Literature & Commun, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",t.grootkormelink@vu.nl,,"Groot Kormelink, Tim/0000-0001-5374-7536",,,,,40,16,16,6,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1461-670X,1469-9699,,JOURNALISM STUD,Journal.

However, less is known about how journalists themselves perceive this relationship, which matters for understanding how they use these technologies. In this paper, we draw on 85 interviews with news workers from four countries in both the Global North and South to examine journalists' narratives-as metajournalistic discourse-about how platforms impact trust in news. We find that practitioners across all environments express mostly critical ideas about platforms vis-a-vis trust on two different levels. First, they describ platforms as disruptive to journalistic practices in ways that strain traditional norms on which trust is based. Second, they discuss platforms as altering the contexts in which journalistic texts and discourses about journalism circulate, weakening the profession's authority. Despite these reservations, most continue relying on platforms to reach audiences, highlighting the complex choices they must make in an increasingly platform-dominated media environment. As discourses connecting journalistic practice and meaning, these narratives speak to tensions within journalism as a profession around appropriate norms and practices, and challenges to the profession's claims to authority.","[Arguedas, Amy A.

We conducted interviews with 20 participants from the Australian state of Victoria which experienced the country's most sustained lockdown measures. Our data shows that people restricted their news consumption for a range of wellbeing-related reasons. Avoidance practices were shaped by household contexts and involved strategies for remaining informed to a limited degree. These findings contribute to an emerging evidence base that points to the benefits of partial news avoidance. They also reiterate the value of public health advice that suggests limiting news during a crisis.

Using rare in-depth interviews with 30 directors and senior policymakers in 16 of the world's largest donor countries, we found that the majority of these bureaucrats believed that sudden-onset, national news coverage can increase levels of emergency humanitarian aid allocated to a crisis. They said that this influence operated by triggering other accountability institutions (the public, civil society, elected officials) who put pressure on aid bureaucracies to announce additional funding. However, these practitioners claim that annual humanitarian aid allocations-which are much larger-are unaffected by news pressure. Intriguingly, we also find that many respondents interpret a lack of news coverage as grounds for increasing their annual aid allocations to what they call forgotten crises. We argue that bureaucratic mediatisation, rather than the CNN Effect or the Cockroach Effect, provides the most appropriate theoretical perspective to understand these multiple, concurrent and indirect forms of media influence. These findings have important implications for government donors, news organisations and aid agencies, and for our wider understanding of how news coverage may influence foreign policy.","[Scott, Martin] Univ East Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Norwich, Norfolk, England; [Bunce, Mel] City Univ London, Dept Journalism, London, England; [Wright, Kate] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland",University of East Anglia; City University London; University of Edinburgh,"Scott, M (corresponding author), Univ East Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Norwich, Norfolk, England.",Martin.Scott@uea.ac.uk,,"Bunce, Mel/0000-0002-4924-8993; Wright, Kate/0000-0002-2896-590X; Scott, Martin/0000-0001-6744-443X",Arts and Humanities Research Council [AH/N00731X/1],Arts and Humanities Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC)),This work was supported by Arts and Humanities Research Council [grant number AH/N00731X/1].,,41,1,1,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1461-670X,1469-9699,,JOURNALISM STUD,Journal.

Such efforts will enable the diversity of journalism cultures that differ from those in the West. This research was conducted on journalists working in Yogyakarta, a region in Indonesia. This study shows that local culture, in this case, the Javanese culture, contributes to creating the journalism culture among journalists in Yogyakarta either in their journalism values or practices. This influence is evident in their politeness, language propriety, and criticism style. Several informants stated that they choose a criticism style that is not vulgar. They believe that there is no need for vulgar criticism because their style of criticism is effective because both the journalists and their subjects of criticism are from the same cultural environment.","[Syamsiyah Lestari Sjafiie, Sri; Pawito, Pawito; Muktiyo, Widodo; Hastjarjo, Sri] Univ Sebelas Maret UNS, Fac Social & Polit Sci, Surakarta, Indonesia",Sebelas Maret University,"Sjafiie, SSL (corresponding author), Univ Sebelas Maret UNS, Fac Social & Polit Sci, Surakarta, Indonesia.",srisyamsiyah2014@gmail.com,"Hastjarjo, Sri/GPC-7130-2022",,,,,,59,0,0,3,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1461-670X,1469-9699,,JOURNALISM STUD,Journal.

The digital reportage on the science and politics nexus uncovers media populism which largely crystallizes the mediatization of politics in Rodrigo Duterte's Philippines. A reading of science-related articles published by the leading dominant news media outlets unfolds discursive narratives that impact the watchdog function of the Fourth Estate. Government science mainstreams official State accounts including the anti-science sentiments of Duterte. Reforming science is a middle-ground, reformist-inspired narrative that features legislative and policy measures.

Two experiments were conducted. The findings of the first experiment suggest that transparency in its current form may not increase news consumers' trust. The second experiment explored possible explanations for the findings of the first study. The results of the second experiment indicate that while audiences value transparency in reporting, they struggle to recognize and recall the presence of transparency and transparency features within a news online article.

When conducting pairwise, automated comparisons between articles published on the same day in the same country, we rather find a modest over time increase in diversity between newspapers.

It animates sociomateriality as a suitable conceptual framework to dissect human and nonhuman agency in editorial judgment and presents future research with ontological paths for considering their relationship. When platforms are accused of bias or partisanship, this pinpoints the importance of perceptions of who is in charge of editorial judgment. This article suggests that by utilizing a sociomateriality framework to disentangle the interplay of the human and the algorithmic, editorial judgment surfaces as a seminal similarity between media and platforms. The ancillary concept of commensurability serves as an analytical heuristic to render such comparisons possible.

Focus is placed on Singapore, a global city in Asia, and interviews with local newsworkers and a two-part content analysis of their nomination-worthy data stories and actual data stories produced were conducted. Results indicate a view of improving the audience experience as consumer rather than citizen, and a tendency for data stories on politics to be set beyond one's own borders. A lower data literacy among newsworkers may also have hindered the complexity and variety of data visualizations used and resulted in extensive reference to official sources.

By using a longitudinal design conducted with a chatbot survey among Dutch users (n = 189), this study provides first empirical evidence that helps clarify conceptual differences. First, it estimates the prevalence of these different types of news non-attendance. Second, it tests to what extend cognitive restrictions, quality assessments, and personal relevance are relevant predictors in explaining engagement in three types of non-attendance to news. Third, the study investigates how news usage behaviors (e.g., news curation, news snacking, and verification engagement) may serve as potential user-driven counter strategies against news avoidance. We find evidence for the conceptual differences. Only small shares of news non-attendance are explained by avoidance motivations. Especially news curation and verification engagement can mitigate common drivers of news avoidance, while news snacking reinforces them.","[Ohme, Jakob; Araujo, Theo; Zarouali, Brahim; de Vreese, Claes H.] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Commun Res ASCoR, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Ohme, Jakob] Free Univ Berlin, Weizenbaum Inst Networked Soc, Berlin, Germany",University of Amsterdam; Free University of Berlin,"Ohme, J (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Commun Res ASCoR, Amsterdam, Netherlands.;Ohme, J (corresponding author), Free Univ Berlin, Weizenbaum Inst Networked Soc, Berlin, Germany.",j.ohme@uva.nl,,"Zarouali, Brahim/0000-0003-1042-4635; Araujo, Theo/0000-0002-4633-9339","Research Priority Area 'Communication', Faculty of Social and Behavioural Sciences","Research Priority Area 'Communication', Faculty of Social and Behavioural Sciences","This work was supported by Research Priority Area 'Communication', Faculty of Social and Behavioural Sciences.",,75,0,0,9,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1461-670X,1469-9699,,JOURNALISM STUD,Journal.

With influences from positive psychology, solutions journalism (SOJO) is proposed as a way to improve audiences' mental wellbeing and engagement with the news. However, research seldom systematically examines how SOJO psychologically empowers audiences, leaving a gap for a more thorough understanding of the potential of SOJO in fulfilling the democratic role of journalism. Drawing on the theory of psychological empowerment (PE) and through 59 in-depth interviews with members of the public in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, we examine UK audience responses to the concept of SOJO. Normatively promising findings emerged from our study. SOJO was considered to be useful in intrapersonal empowerment (i.e., increasing perceived control and self-efficacy), interactional empowerment (i.e., enhancing critical awareness), and behavioural empowerment (i.e., motivating community involvement and coping behaviours). Theoretically, this study establishes a firm connection between SOJO and PE which, we argue, has important implications for journalism's often troubled relationship with civic engagement. As such, we call for a rethinking of the often taken-for-granted problem-focussed news practices.","[Zhao, Xin; Jackson, Daniel; Nguyen, An] Bournemouth Univ, Dept Commun & Journalism, Poole, Dorset, England",Bournemouth University,"Zhao, X (corresponding author), Bournemouth Univ, Dept Commun & Journalism, Poole, Dorset, England.",xzhao@bournemouth.ac.uk,,"Zhao, Xin/0000-0001-6853-7224; Jackson, Daniel/0000-0002-8833-9476; Nguyen, An/0000-0002-7074-6807",UKRI/AHRC [AH/V015168/1],UKRI/AHRC,This work was supported by the UKRI/AHRC under grant number AH/V015168/1.

The study provides a conceptual model of this process based on a distinction between liquid and solid negotiation strategies, in the sense of Deuze.. Liquid strategies involve reinterpreting, contesting and combining various journalistic roles, leading journalists to negotiate their investigative performance based on various individual organizational and institutional factors. Conversely, solid strategies tend to involve dogmatic attitudes toward investigative journalism. While this approach allows journalists to live by their ideals most of the time, it can also lead to simply dropping out.

The two works are used for comparison in the analysis, which is based on semi-structured thematic interviews with 27 political journalists. The findings indicate growing uncertainty among Finnish political journalists. Their external boundaries are still negotiated mainly between elected institutional political actors and journalists, and structural dependencies favor attempts to reach mutual understanding. However, there has been more turbulence in their internal boundaries because of the increasing impact of other journalists on political journalism. Amongst political journalists, young reporters stand out: their relations to non-journalistic actors differ from their older colleagues, and their internal position has been affected most by the growing pressures in newsrooms.","[Valiverronen, Jari] Tampere Univ, Fac Informat Technol & Commun Sci, Tampere, Finland",Tampere University,"Valiverronen, J (corresponding author), Tampere Univ, Fac Informat Technol & Commun Sci, Tampere, Finland.",jari.valiverronen@tuni.fi,,"Valiverronen, Jari/0000-0002-5198-6493",,,,,93,1,1,1,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1461-670X,1469-9699,,JOURNALISM STUD,Journal.

Thus, much of the decision-making and restrictions to prevent the spread of the virus had to occur at the organizational level, i.e., within companies. This paper reports the findings from an online survey carried out in June-September 2020 (n = 196), in which Swedish media managers were asked to focus on perceived media leadership during the COVID-19 crisis. The results indicate that Swedish media managers acted with confidence in their remote leadership and engaged in crisis management leader tasks in line with previous crisis management research. While managers learned to appreciate remote work, they stressed the difficulty of being an inspiring leader in a remote setting and the challenge of motivating creativity, one of the most important components in managing journalism and media work.","[Appelgren, Ester] Sodertorn Univ, Dept Journalism, Huddinge, Sweden",Sodertorn University,"Appelgren, E (corresponding author), Sodertorn Univ, Dept Journalism, Huddinge, Sweden.",ester.appelgren@sh.se,"Appelgren, Ester/ABE-3864-2021","Appelgren, Ester/0000-0003-1428-9477","Medieledarna, the union for Swedish Media Leaders","Medieledarna, the union for Swedish Media Leaders","The work of this article was partly supported by Medieledarna, the union for Swedish Media Leaders.",,38,5,5,10,36,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1461-670X,1469-9699,,JOURNALISM STUD,Journal.

As such, it has limited capacity to provide a holistic account of the causes and consequences of audience engagement with COVID-19 news, or to consider the impact of systemic political and media factors. To compensate for that, we examine a large set of qualitative interviews and media diaries collected in four eastern European countries during the first wave of the pandemic. We show that changes in news consumption-including the resurgence of television and decline of print consumption-were not driven solely by audience demand for up-to-date information, but also by practical constrains of home-bound life in lockdown, and the introduction of live briefings. Our findings underscore disruption and uncertainty as key elements of audience experiences and highlight the markedly privatized and depoliticized nature of public debate in the early phase of the pandemic. We argue that the pandemic was an unpredictable, open-ended, and exhausting media event with high potential for divisiveness and polarization, especially in contexts marked by low levels of media freedom, declining democratic standards, and elite-led politicization of the crisis.","[Mihelj, Sabina; Kondor, Katherine; Stetka, Vaclav] Loughborough Univ, Ctr Res Commun & Culture, Loughborough, Leics, England",Loughborough University,"Mihelj, S (corresponding author), Loughborough Univ, Ctr Res Commun & Culture, Loughborough, Leics, England.",s.mihelj@lboro.ac.uk,"Mihelj, Sabina/AAS-7495-2021; Stetka, Vaclav/AAR-6858-2021","Stetka, Vaclav/0000-0001-8381-3645; Mihelj, Sabina/0000-0002-8557-2504; Kondor, Katherine/0000-0002-1036-3644",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/S01019X/1],Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),This research was supported by the Economic and Social Research Council [ES/S01019X/1].,,45,9,9,3,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1461-670X,1469-9699,,JOURNALISM STUD,Journal.

The results show that the news values of Impact, Superlativeness, Proximity, and Eliteness are often prioritized in both newspapers. For cross-cultural differences, the Chinese newspaper prefers a constructive reporting style through emphasizing Positivity in terms of agency, proactive measures, and favorable outcomes in fighting the outbreaks. The American newspaper prioritizes Proximity in terms of relevance to its audience. For diachronic changes, the Chinese newspaper has developed a unique theme to construct Positivity by calling for the solidarity of the international community. The Chinese newspaper also moves away from prioritizing geographic Proximity and government actors in constructing Eliteness. The American newspaper, however, changes to cover more government actors.

Drawing on a news diary study of 200 participants during the pandemic, we found they easily identified examples of fake news but were less aware of relevant facts that might help them understand how the UK government managed the crisis. Our content analysis of 1259 television news items revealed broadcasters did not routinely draw on statistics to contextualise the UK's record of managing the coronavirus or regularly make comparisons with other countries. Given television news bulletins were the dominant news source for many people in the UK, we suggest the information environment gave audiences limited opportunities to understand the government's performance internationally. We argue that misinformation is often a symptom of editorial choices in media coverage-including television news produced by public service broadcasters-that can lead to gaps in public knowledge.

Thus, this study aims to determine the extent to which sources and editorial lines influence frame building. The results of analysing 1095 news items confirm the relationship between the papers' editorial lines and eco-frames, though what stands out in all the papers is economics-based eco-indifference. In the economy section, neither the main sources (industry) nor the journalists consider the environmental angle while reporting on the energy sector. Energy as an issue is, above all, an economic topic, even in the global context of the fight against climate change. A correlation between a particular type of source and frame was found, thus expanding the understanding of the role sources play as framing devices in journalistic texts.

These groups may also contest the form of democracy that has been implemented, and the way in which it deals with key transitional issues such as past human rights violations. This study focuses on how such groups are represented in one post-authoritarian society: Uruguay, which returned to democracy in 1985. Through examining media access for civil society groups in the newspaper coverage of two critical plebiscites on transitional justice issues (1989 and 2009), combined with interviews with journalists and civil society representatives, it argues that there are significant barriers to media access for civil society actors in the return to democracy, which relate both to changes during the democratisation process and domestic journalistic norms. This signals the need for both greater attention to the normative media role of representation during processes of democratisation and a more critical approach to media democratisation theory.","[Pearson, Bethia] Univ Glasgow, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland",University of Glasgow,"Pearson, B (corresponding author), Univ Glasgow, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland.",Bethia.pearson@glasgow.ac.uk,,,"Economic and Social Research Council PhD award; College of Social Sciences, University of Glasgow","Economic and Social Research Council PhD award; College of Social Sciences, University of Glasgow","This research was funded by an Economic and Social Research Council PhD award and approved by the ethics committee of the College of Social Sciences, University of Glasgow.",,47,0,0,1,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1461-670X,1469-9699,,JOURNALISM STUD,Journal.

By looking at this outlet as well as two other contemporary niche media, Harvest (2013-) and Naturpress (2016-), we show how this term provided a way of working with frequency, one of the 12 news values outlined in Galtung and Ruge's seminal study from 1965. Inspired by discourse-historical analysis, we base our article on interviews with the editors of the three outlets, their journalistic output as well as on contextual material in order to show how the slow, uneven, global and partially invisible process of climate change was given a different temporal frame through the notion of the green shift. By addressing notions of frequency in relation to a specific time and context, we speak, on the one hand, to discussions about how an event-driven journalism struggles with the complex temporalities of climate change and, on the other, to recurrent calls for providing a more context-driven reflection on the value and legacy of Galtung and Ruge [Joye, Stijn, Ansgard Heinrich, and Romy Wohler. 2016. 50 Years of Galtung and Ruge: Reflections on Their Model of News Values and its Relevance for the Study of Journalism and Communication Today.

As public-facing spaces oriented toward attracting clients, these sites are understood as discursive artifacts that provide insight into how news organizations negotiate their allegiance to norms of journalistic autonomy while simultaneously developing the role of creating paid advertising campaigns that sit alongside news content. Our analysis reveals that news organizations simultaneously engage in discourses of integration and separation between native advertising and news content. They signal the integration between news and advertising through the usage of story as an umbrella term for digital content while also maintaining separation through nuanced language choices that imply some degree of distance between news and native advertising. These diverging discourses demonstrate how fraught native advertising is for news organizations striving to be recognized as legitimate providers of authoritative news while attempting to bolster revenues in face of the difficulties arising with the digital advertising market. These findings draw on and expand discursive theories in journalism studies by broadening inquiry beyond news content to encompass the complex terrain of content production emerging within the digital space.","[Carlson, Matt; Locke, Andrew] Univ Minnesota, Hubbard Sch Journalism & Mass Commun, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Carlson, M (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Hubbard Sch Journalism & Mass Commun, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",carlson1@umn.edu,,,,,,,45,0,0,6,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1461-670X,1469-9699,,JOURNALISM STUD,Journal.

Using structural topic modeling, 705 news stories and 174 official press releases were analyzed to identify under which conditions the media may attribute blame when natural disasters are framed beyond the realm of an accident. Findings indicate the government portrayed its own performance as a successful one where all actors did their job to minimize disaster consequences. Yet, the media narrative did not reflect the government's efficiency frame, portraying the official response as a result of lessons learned from a previous disaster. Taken together, the results suggest that when the media align with a particular political side, disaster characteristics are not the main issue to report on. This study departs from a description of journalistic practices in time of disasters towards a more complex view of the relationship between government and the press when it comes to disaster coverage.","[Saldana, Magdalena] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Millennium Inst Fdn Res Data IMFD, Sch Commun, Santiago, Chile",Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile,"Saldana, M (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Millennium Inst Fdn Res Data IMFD, Sch Commun, Santiago, Chile.",magdalena.saldana@uc.cl,"SaldaÃ±a, Magdalena/ABD-4714-2021","SaldaÃ±a, Magdalena/0000-0002-1218-0091",,,,,55,0,0,3,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1461-670X,1469-9699,,JOURNALISM STUD,Journal.

Four main findings emerged. First, we found that as far as broadcast journalists are concerned there are no alternatives to the newsroom; making news in the newsroom was synonymous with their professional journalistic identity. A second finding is to highlight the key role of place in shaping press-source relations. In our case, the loss of physical proximity to government sources had major consequences for power relations between journalists and authorities. Third, certain news objects held particular meaning for journalists, and that when disrupted, can have deleterious consequences for their professional identity. Finally, our study witnessed an important shift in journalistic routines that favoured the live field report over pre-recorded packages or in-depth analysis. Findings are discussed in the context of ongoing debates about journalistic routines, identities, and the material turn in journalism studies.","[Saptorini, Endah; Zhao, Xin; Jackson, Daniel] Bournemouth Univ, Dept Commun & Journalism, Poole, Dorset, England",Bournemouth University,"Zhao, X (corresponding author), Bournemouth Univ, Dept Commun & Journalism, Poole, Dorset, England.",xzhao@bournemouth.ac.uk,"Zhao, Xin/AAT-5158-2020","Zhao, Xin/0000-0001-6853-7224; Jackson, Daniel/0000-0002-8833-9476",,,,,58,3,3,2,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1461-670X,1469-9699,,JOURNALISM STUD,Journal.

Through qualitative study using semi-structured interviews with 14 journalists and two editors-in-chief, I found three types of news sourcing practices that are currently adopted: news sourcing practices that use national actors as the main source; practices that use international news sources as cognitive inventory; and practices that rely on the international news flow. These practices are highly influenced by audience needs, the internet algorithm, and the news platforms for which the journalists work.

But what happens when newsmakers are faced with the question of whether to report, and how to report, on ultra-right actors? Whereas on one side, journalists are supposed to report on anything that is relevant, on the other, by reporting on it, they risk amplifying its significance. This dilemma becomes more complex when journalists deal with players who inhabit a grey zone in between legitimacy and deviance, as the ultra-right actors studied here. Although the kind of questions that newsmakers face might be similar to those they encounter when covering far-right populists or even terrorists, the fact that the ultra-right (at least in a country like Italy) has been historically tolerated as part of the normal political dialectic, raises additional concerns. Thus, the fundamental question is how reporters approach those who are known for their fascistic ideologies, yet who at the same time may be organized in political parties or cultural organizations, thus recognized by the state and somehow normalized in the public sphere. The empirical contribution is based upon data from in-depth interviews with 23 Italian journalists.","[Padovani, Cinzia] Southern Illinois Univ, Coll Arts & Media, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA",Southern Illinois University System; Southern Illinois University,"Padovani, C (corresponding author), Southern Illinois Univ, Coll Arts & Media, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA.",cinzia.padovani@gmail.com,,,Marie S.

Using methods from participatory governance and design thinking, three panels of journalists and platform news representatives in 2020 tried to find consensus around value definitions that could inform the ranking and recommendation of news articles. Examining how they negotiated the areas of local, opinion, and science/health journalism, we discover possibilities and limitations for journalists to inform the design of these systems. More broadly, the effort to prioritize news content according to journalistic values belongs to a larger question regarding the role of expertise within democratic societies. The establishment of technical definitions in collaboration with others can be understood as a softer form of algorithmic governance. This governance may allow for some democratizing potential in online systems, here within a minipublic model defined by political scientist Archon Fung. Yet the implementation of these definitions remains within the decision-making power of technology companies that do not identify as news publishers.

By drawing on literature dealing with freelance careers, the study shows how journalists navigate the market in their pursuit of jobs that make their work worthwhile. By means of networking, bundling jobs, blurring boundaries between writing and editing, and being jacks of all trades, they can partially influence which kinds of jobs they are offered, and what kind of work they want to pursue in the future. However, most of these practices function as career maintenance, directing focus and effort at avoiding downward career movement rather than achieving upward mobility. The study thus illustrates the difficulties of achieving career progression as a freelance journalist.

Against the background of increasing distrust in and tune out of news media observed in several countries, this study investigates the role of fatigue from ongoing news issues for how audiences evaluate news media. It examines reciprocal causal relations between news users' fatigue from ongoing news issues and their evaluations of news media with focus on the Brexit issue. A three-wave panel survey was conducted in Switzerland from April 11 to June 11, 2019. Random intercept cross-lagged panel models show that issue fatigue leads to negative evaluations of an issue's media coverage and vice versa. However, issue fatigue does not predict negative news coverage evaluations in general and hostile media perceptions. Implications of ongoing news issues on news media evaluations are discussed, considering citizens' attachment to news media faltering in today's news environment.","[Gurr, Gwendolin] Univ Fribourg, Dept Commun & Media Res, Fribourg, Switzerland",University of Fribourg,"Gurr, G (corresponding author), Univ Fribourg, Dept Commun & Media Res, Fribourg, Switzerland.",gwendolin.gurr@unifr.ch,,"Gurr, Gwendolin/0000-0002-0315-1707",Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [176356],Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),"This work was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF), Grant 176356.",,82,1,1,7,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1461-670X,1469-9699,,JOURNALISM STUD,Journal.

Through qualitative interviews with winners of CNN competitions, this paper specifically investigates how news professionals discursively construct the notion of excellence within the space of international award practice, and then how they subsequently perceive their roles in the post-award dispensation. The key findings show that journalists' understanding of excellence through awards is fluid and based on individual, institutional as well as professional notions of what constitutes par/sub-par journalism. These bearers of excellence perceive themselves as promoters of high standards of journalistic practice and champions of normative roles, such as the watchdog role, which fits into the broader mission of the specific institution sponsoring the awards.","[Kibarabara, Joy] Stockholm Univ, Dept Media Studies, Stockholm, Sweden; [Cheruiyot, David] Univ Groningen, Ctr Media & Journalism Studies, Groningen, Netherlands; [Muindi, Benjamin] Zetech Univ, Dept Media, Nairobi, Kenya",Stockholm University; University of Groningen,"Cheruiyot, D (corresponding author), Univ Groningen, Ctr Media & Journalism Studies, Groningen, Netherlands.",d.k.cheruiyot@rug.nl,,,,,,,71,0,0,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1461-670X,1469-9699,,JOURNALISM STUD,Journal.

However, no research so far has examined how specific news values may be frequently co-constructed to package an individual news story and make it more appealing to potential readers. This research adopts the discursive news values analysis (DNVA) approach to examine the co-construction of news values in the multimodal discourse of TIME magazine covers (n = 300). To identify such co-construction, this study adopts cluster analysis, which has yet been deployed to study news values. The use of cluster analysis has identified six different combinations of news values repeatedly been observed together in clusters of covers. These combinations may represent what the magazine perceives as most attractive to the target audience. This study has also revealed intersemiotic relations in news values construction. While some news values are often reinforced across the verbal (i.e., cover line) and visual (i.e., cover image) semiotic modes, others rely more on the verbal mode. This study crosses disciplinary boundaries by bringing corpus linguistics techniques into journalism studies to understand a previously under-explored news genre.","[Zhang, Weiyu; Cheung, Yin Ling] Nanyang Technol Univ, Natl Inst Educ, Singapore, Singapore",Nanyang Technological University & National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore; Nanyang Technological University; National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore,"Zhang, WY (corresponding author), Nanyang Technol Univ, Natl Inst Educ, Singapore, Singapore.",nie18zhan20@e.ntu.edu.sg,"Zhang, Weiyu/ABB-8599-2020; CHEUNG, Yin Ling/S-9846-2017","Zhang, Weiyu/0000-0002-1005-7858; CHEUNG, Yin Ling/0000-0001-6382-438X",,,,,51,0,0,8,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1461-670X,1469-9699,,JOURNALISM STUD,Journal.

A suggested approach to reporting which remains informative while tempering audience distress is constructive journalism. We investigated the benefits and applications of constructive news reporting during COVID-19 from the perspectives of journalism professionals interested in constructive approaches. Eleven participants from four continents were interviewed in the first two months of the pandemic. The data were analysed using thematic analysis, and two themes produced: Sober not sensational and What's positive in a pandemic? Six subthemes were also produced: beyond the numbers, slower reporting, understanding uncertainty, solutions, we're all in the same boat and awakening. Constructive approaches were seen to help journalists navigate their roles as educators and to provide hope without inciting undue panic. Our interviews suggest constructive news reporting could assist in balancing informativeness and public mental health throughout the pandemic. More work is needed, however, that incorporates randomised controlled testing to establish whether constructive journalism techniques meaningfully impact audience mental health beyond standard approaches.","[van Antwerpen, Natasha; Turnbull, Deborah; Searston, Rachel A.] Univ Adelaide, Sch Psychol, Adelaide, SA, Australia",University of Adelaide,"van Antwerpen, N (corresponding author), Univ Adelaide, Sch Psychol, Adelaide, SA, Australia.",natasha.vanantwerpen@adelaide.edu.au,"van Antwerpen, Natasha/GRJ-7286-2022",,"Australian Government Department of Education, Skills and Employment","Australian Government Department of Education, Skills and Employment","This research was supported by an Australian Government Department of Education, Skills and Employment.",,47,1,1,12,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1461-670X,1469-9699,,JOURNALISM STUD,Journal.

Specifically, we seek to understand how they redefined and negotiated their professional roles to survive in Colombia's complex and unsafe environment. The results of our analysis reveal four emerging roles: (1) resilient watchdog; (2) savvy expert; (3) crusader; (4) and community-embedded. The texts examined also reveal how journalists negotiated the agenda-building, since reporters were forced to limit on-site newsgathering, consult multiple sources, self-censor, and deal with the differential working conditions of metropolitan and local journalists as a consequence of risk. This study contributes to role theory by focusing on narrated roles of an insecure democracy from an inductive approach. It further introduces an innovative perspective to boundary work theory, since reporters' boundaries have been challenged in new, often menacing ways, due to the world's longest-running internal conflict and transition to peace.","[Cancino-Borbon, Andrea; Barrios, Marta Milena; Salas-Vega, Lyz] Univ Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia",Universidad del Norte,"Cancino-Borbon, A (corresponding author), Univ Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia.",cancinoa@uninorte.edu.co,"Barrios, Marta Milena/F-1509-2015; CANCINO-BORBON, Andrea/L-7681-2016","Barrios, Marta Milena/0000-0002-5279-1049; CANCINO-BORBON, Andrea/0000-0002-7106-2992",,,,,53,1,1,2,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1461-670X,1469-9699,,JOURNALISM STUD,Journal.

Moreover, it often embodies the stance of the news writer or the news agency on a particular issue and could program the reader's perception and interpretation of the ensuing news story in a pre-determined direction. In view of the distinctive significance of headlines in news discourse, in this paper, we analyze how the headlines of The Economist, an elite newsmagazine, frame China in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. The sample of headlines was examined for their structural components, syntactic features, as well as linguistic characteristics, and compared with a selection of the outlet's headlines on COVID responses of certain other countries. Through identifying the framing patterns adopted in the headlines and unpacking the ideological overtones encoded therein, this systematic analysis has illuminated the role and effects of the tactful employment of language in constructing country image and striking a balance between purported impartiality and ideological dispositions. Its findings and implications are expected to contribute to scholarship on media framing and inform the practice of journalistic writing.","[Sun, Xiaoya] Xian Int Studies Univ, Sch Translat Studies, Xian, Peoples R China; [Sun, Xiaoya; Cheung, Yin Ling] Nanyang Technol Univ, Natl Inst Educ, Singapore, Singapore",Xi'an International Studies University; Nanyang Technological University & National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore; Nanyang Technological University; National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore,"Sun, XY (corresponding author), Xian Int Studies Univ, Sch Translat Studies, Xian, Peoples R China.;Sun, XY (corresponding author), Nanyang Technol Univ, Natl Inst Educ, Singapore, Singapore.",nie173595@e.ntu.edu.sg,,,,,,,48,0,0,1,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1461-670X,1469-9699,,JOURNALISM STUD,Journal.

The objective of this article is to help to fill this gap by focusing on the lived experiences and struggles of key Turkish-speaking women journalists who worked in private and public sector media outlets in Turkey in the period 1920-1980. Drawing on these women's self-narratives and biographical accounts, as well as arguments in debates on parrhesia and emancipatory journalism in dialogue with Third World/Global South feminist epistemologies, we explore the ways in which journalism has been a site of life-time resistance and struggle for women seeking justice and truth on behalf of the oppressed. Their conceptualization of journalistic identity as truth- and justice-seekers in an unfree media environment, and their determination to speak the truth to challenge intersecting forces of domination cannot be captured in the binary of media freedom and media development paradigms. Nonetheless, their struggle to dismantle oppressive reality by way of distinctive, courageous, justice-seeking and truthful communication can be educative at a time when the relationship between journalism and truth is increasingly being undermined.","[Celik, Burce] Loughborough Univ, Inst Media & Creat Ind, Loughborough, Leics, England; [Haydari, Nazan] Istanbul Bilgi Univ, Fac Commun, Istanbul, Turkey",Loughborough University; Istanbul Bilgi University,"Celik, B (corresponding author), Loughborough Univ, Inst Media & Creat Ind, Loughborough, Leics, England.",b.celik@lboro.ac.uk,,,European Endowment for Democracy [935]; Istanbul Bilgi University Research Funds [AK85 020],European Endowment for Democracy; Istanbul Bilgi University Research Funds,This work was supported by European Endowment for Democracy: [Grant Number 935]; Istanbul Bilgi University Research Funds: [Grant Number AK85 020].,,57,0,0,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1461-670X,1469-9699,,JOURNALISM STUD,Journal.

However, news users' methods of navigating normative expectations about their emotive experiences with news remain unclear. This article operationalizes the concept of feeling rules to uncover responses to discrepancies between emotive expectations and experiences with news, developing a novel analytical approach using linguistic and paralinguistic indices of perceived norm breaking. It applies this to a quota sample of Danes between 18 and 24 years of age, asked about their information-seeking practices using semi-structured interviews and a card-sorting exercise to prompt reflections about a broad spectrum of media. The article makes manifest four strategies for negotiating misalignments between feelings rules and emotive experiences: (1) discontinuation and (2) continuation of media use flouting feeling rules, (3) compartmentalization, and (4) justification. The findings advance our scholarly understanding of news use as a site of complex social identity negotiation for young people, where not only externally visible behaviors but also emotive experiences such as seriousness and (dis)trust are prescribed, in order to explain underlying mechanisms behind the behavioral change-and resistance to change.","[Lehaff, Josephine] Roskilde Univ, Dept Commun & Arts, Roskilde, Denmark",Roskilde University,"Lehaff, J (corresponding author), Roskilde Univ, Dept Commun & Arts, Roskilde, Denmark.",Lehaff@ruc.dk,,"Lehaff, Josephine/0000-0002-3906-3610",Independent Research Fund Denmark [8018-00061B],Independent Research Fund Denmark,"This article is part of the research project Beyond the Here and Now of News, funded by the Independent Research Fund Denmark under grant number 8018-00061B.

We interviewed 133 journalists from 60 countries. Utilising the lens of the Diffusion of Innovations Theory, we found that journalists generally perceive the impact of digital practices as positive, but structural and individual factors heavily influence the adoption processes. Journalists from the Global South stress the importance of simple everyday technology and report that they only have limited access to data, which is in stark contrast to interviewees from the Global North. Journalists across countries feel overwhelmed by the need for digital skills, especially those related to digital security. They often work in interdisciplinary teams to address these challenges, which allows them to combine skills and tackle more complex topics. Overall, we found that traditional approaches remain indispensable to investigative work around the world, while innovative digital practices are adopted cautiously in accordance with the journalistic mission. We call for a global network to facilitate diffusion of digital practices, addressing that journalists from the Global South are often laggards against their will due to contextual factors.","[Kunert, Jessica] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Dept Journalism, Mainz, Germany; [Frech, Jannis; Brueggemann, Michael; Lilienthal, Volker] Univ Hamburg, Inst Journalism & Commun Studies, Fac Business Econ & Social Sci, Hamburg, Germany; [Loosen, Wiebke] Leibniz Inst Medienforsch, Hans Bredow Inst HBI, Hamburg, Germany",Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz; University of Hamburg,"Kunert, J (corresponding author), Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Dept Journalism, Mainz, Germany.",Jessica.Kunert@uni-mainz.de,,"Loosen, Wiebke/0000-0002-2211-2260; Frech, Jannis/0000-0001-8566-0195; Kunert, Jessica/0000-0001-6370-1558; Bruggemann, Michael/0000-0001-7994-3914",,,,,63,0,0,3,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1461-670X,1469-9699,,JOURNALISM STUD,Journal.

Whereas audience orientation is often implicitly assumed in concepts of commercial news logic, a stronger consideration of the audience in news media logic is needed, particularly in times of more interactive and participatory digital media. In this article, we investigate whether, on the one hand, market-oriented commercial logic has retained its importance and, on the other hand, a new connection-strengthening audience logic has emerged. We empirically analyze these two logics in a quantitative content analysis of political news coverage, combining a cross-temporal, a cross-national, and a cross-organizational perspective. Our results suggest that commercial logic has peaked in the past few decades and that an audience logic has developed in parallel. Yet, there are notable differences between countries and different types of media organizations.","[Blassnig, Sina; Esser, Frank] Univ Zurich, Dept Mass Commun & Media Res, Zurich, Switzerland",University of Zurich,"Blassnig, S (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Dept Mass Commun & Media Res, Zurich, Switzerland.",s.blassnig@ikmz.uzh.ch,"Blassnig, Sina/T-3959-2019","Blassnig, Sina/0000-0002-7815-0186",,,,,52,2,2,6,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1461-670X,1469-9699,,JOURNALISM STUD,Journal.

To test this assumption, an online two-wave panel survey among a quota sample representing the German population aged 18+ was conducted in March and April 2020. Applying a path model, we show that using high-quality news media for information on the corona crisis (e.g., public broadcasting services) nourished people's sense of cohesion, while using alternative and hyperpartisan news sites had a detrimental effect. Relying on information from low-quality news media (e.g., tabloids) did not affect people's sense of cohesion, while talking to private contacts had a limited positive effect. Perceiving the public discourse as constructive vs. dramatized mediated the effects.

To understand how the job function and routines of newspaper sports journalists were impacted during the initial U.S. outbreak (March to July 2020), semi-structured in-depth interviews with 23 members of United States (US) print sports media were conducted. Interviewee responses elucidated three main themes: the future of sports journalism is unknown and frightening for those working in the industry, COVID-19 illustrates the importance of interpersonal relationships to produce quality stories, and COVID-19 validates the importance of quality sports journalism. Additionally, interviewees also shed light on the impact that videoconference interviews, specifically those conducted over Zoom, have on the sports journalism field. Even though it was deemed a useful tool during the pandemic, sportswriters feared that teams will continue to limit access by relegating all interviews to Zoom, thus drastically changing the norms of sports journalism.

In an attempt to examine how the public made sense of Brexit and its potential consequences, we analyse all letters to the editor discussing Brexit or the campaign published in British daily national newspapers in the two months before the referendum. Through a content analysis of 1419 letters, we examine the main themes, capturing the key concerns, criticisms, and political aspirations expressed by citizens. Leave messages largely dominated in Leave newspapers, whereas a wider range of voices were represented in Remain titles. Leave voices, therefore, resonated more strongly throughout the letters. Our analysis points to changing forms of public debate: in a debate dominated by negativity, readers mainly argued against leaving or remaining in the EU, as opposed to arguing in favour of these options, to the extent that some readers expressed frustration with the negativity of the campaigns, and of media coverage. Ultimately, this study tentatively explores whether these fora constituted arenas for debate, or off-line echo-chambers.","[Garcia-Blanco, Inaki; Bennett, Lucy] Cardiff Univ, Sch Journalism Media & Culture, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales",Cardiff University,"Garcia-Blanco, I (corresponding author), Cardiff Univ, Sch Journalism Media & Culture, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales.",garcia-blancoi@cardiff.ac.uk,,,,,,,87,0,0,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1461-670X,1469-9699,,JOURNALISM STUD,Journal.

However, the application of such a media-centric criterion runs the risk of projecting an a-historical perspective to the phenomenon as such. By contrast, using the example of the public funeral of the Swedish King Oscar II in 1907, the purpose of this article is to scrutinize and categorize the different efforts on part of the journalists to create media events before broadcasting. Four types of journalistic practices are uncovered: (1) highlighting the attention of media in a broad sense in public space (such as church bells, flags, shop windows, etc.) as well as journalistic presence, to endow eventfulness to the occasion; (2) acting as witness ambassador to evoke the senses of the media audience; (3) mediating the witnessing public participating on location to emphasise the engagement of the whole society; (4) using different kinds of narrativization, such as cross-cutting, to bring a sense of immediacy to the reporting. In terms of theory, the ambition is to draw attention to the journalist's role as a historical narrator, as well as to bring the historical perspective back to the discussion on media events.","[Holgersson, Ulrika] Lund Univ, Dept Commun & Media, Lund, Sweden",Lund University,"Holgersson, U (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Dept Commun & Media, Lund, Sweden.",ulrika.holgersson@kom.lu.se,,"Holgersson, Ulrika/0000-0002-0672-6166",Swedish Research Council [2016-02745],Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research CouncilEuropean Commission),This work was supported by the Swedish Research Council [Grant 2016-02745].,,43,0,0,1,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1461-670X,1469-9699,,JOURNALISM STUD,Journal.

However, while experience is often mentioned, it is either never fully discussed or it is approached in terms of mere sensory or emotional response. Experience, instead, involves additionally (and simultaneously) situatedness, embodiment, and continuous re-processing over time, most of which lies beyond consciousness and is not easily articulated by words. Drawing on Whitehead's processual philosophy and Gendlin's philosophy of the implicit, this article addresses the calls in the field for taking experience seriously. Theoretically, it tackles the ontological leap required to be able to conceive experience. Methodologically and empirically it demonstrates the potential for applying creative techniques to retrieve and express the knowledge beyond words that is not captured by established methods. It does so by sharing the author's reflection matured through long-term experimentation with creative practices in research and the creation of an embroidered collage inspired by the project Being a foreigner at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic: The impact of news consumption on the everyday life of migrants in Norway.

Results show that the participants divide into two types: the perspicacious listeners who realize or suspect that the news reading is artificially synthesized and, to some degree, are annoyed by it, and the oblivious listeners who believe the news is read by a human and are predominantly positive towards it. Participants from both groups pay particular attention to voice emotionality when evaluating the appropriateness of the neural news reader. Also, they tend to attribute human characteristics to the neural news reader. The participants single out the news messages as well as the media organization behind the news broadcast, rather than the neural voice itself as critical components constituting credibility.

Four recommendations are drawn: the importance of a balanced management of data exuberance, their newsworthiness, and the analytical and conceptual tools used to interpret them; the aim of visualization should be more conceptual than descriptive, in order to simplify and clarify complex issues, and relationships between data, to make the explanation of current affairs more relevant and understandable; data journalism needs a harmonious integration of investigative projects with day-to-day coverage; and data journalism should avoid the perils of technological determinism.","[Arrese, Angel] Univ Navarra, Sch Commun, Pamplona, Spain",University of Navarra,"Arrese, A (corresponding author), Univ Navarra, Sch Commun, Pamplona, Spain.",aarrese@unav.es,"Arrese, Angel/A-3993-2016","Arrese, Angel/0000-0002-0586-4188",,,,,118,0,0,8,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1461-670X,1469-9699,,JOURNALISM STUD,Journal.

Using the factor analysis procedure common to Q methodology, we identified two distinct mindsets among the participants. One factor expresses a neutral journalistic mindset that favors dispassionate reporting. The other shows more concern with the impact of journalism on its sources and a desire for more engagement in political discourse. A participant pool larger than that of a typical Q study allowed for additional quantitative analysis that identified significant differences in mindset by age, gender, professional experience, and journalistic platform. Using an explanatory-sequential design, study 2 (n = 16) further explored the journalistic mindset-the underlying web of beliefs and attitudes about the profession's core values-with a textual analysis of follow-up interviews.

Based on an interview study with Swedish trainers from the media aid projects and informed by document analysis, the main research question concerned the role of the trainers in negotiating journalistic practices during the aid projects and the implications of these.

This article asks how the community role of local journalism is understood and assessed by journalists and political actors. The study builds on 26 in-depth interviews with local journalists and local political actors involved in conflicts over localisation of hospitals in two different regions in Norway. Theoretically, the article draws on research into the roles of local news media and the place-making features of local journalism. We conceptualise the community role as an overarching role of local journalism, where characteristics related to, e.g., the watchdog and advocacy roles of local journalism may serve a community function. Our analysis shows that local patriotism is regarded as a key aspect of local journalism, where local news media are expected to report through specific spatial lenses to the benefit of the local community. Yet although local journalists and local political actors largely agree on key ideals of local journalism, they advance different perspectives on what form of local news reporting is in the best interest of the community. In sum, local patriotism is considered both a force and an obstacle when journalists are serving the community.","[Larsen, Anna Grondahl] Univ Oslo, Dept Media & Commun, Oslo, Norway; [Naper, Anja Aaheim] Oslo Metropolitan Univ, Dept Journalism & Media Studies, Oslo, Norway",University of Oslo; Oslo Metropolitan University (OsloMet),"Larsen, AG (corresponding author), Univ Oslo, Dept Media & Commun, Oslo, Norway.",a.g.larsen@media.uio.no,,,Norwegian Council for Applied Media Research,Norwegian Council for Applied Media Research,The work received funding from the Norwegian Council for Applied Media Research.,,47,0,0,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1461-670X,1469-9699,,JOURNALISM STUD,Journal.

In the Brazilian press, the replacement of the French paradigm by the North American one was seen by many as progress, without speculation about the possibility of cultivating a native formula. Associated with the institutional modernization triggered by the 1930 Revolution, the model of news production imported from the United States was softly assimilated instead of being imposed on professionals. There was a passive revolution. Rather than resisting new foreign influences, most of Brazil's first generation of professional journalists and academics exploited for their own benefit the opportunities that, not by chance, emerged from the situation created by the context of the Second World War. On the other hand, the modernization of the press, paradoxically, had no significant impact on professional training within journalism schools, which arose in Brazil as an annex to the faculties of philosophy verified at that time and, therefore, out of step with the pedagogical pragmatism and practical teaching that characterized academically journalism in the United States.","[Daros, Otavio; Rudiger, Francisco] Pontificia Univ Catolica Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil",Pontificia Universidade Catolica Do Rio Grande Do Sul,"Rudiger, F (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.",frudiger@pucrs.br,"Daros, Otavio/L-8457-2018","Daros, Otavio/0000-0003-0738-8207",CAPES; CNPQ,CAPES(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); CNPQ(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)),"This work was supported by CAPES, CNPQ.",,66,0,0,1,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1461-670X,1469-9699,,JOURNALISM STUD,Journal.

All articles published online by ten German news media in a period of one month were collected (n = 21,823). A subset of articles containing Twitter-related keywords (n = 496) and 375 tweets cited in these articles was explored in detail. Our focal analysis of n = 287 articles using Twitter as an information source revealed systematic differences between both media types and article topics regarding the number and style of Twitter references as well as the types of accounts cited. We found that the tabloid paper incorporated the highest number of tweets per article, incorporated tweets primarily in articles on human interest and gossip and cited non-elite sources more often than other media types.

New ideas are vital for legacy media news organisations to innovate and fundamentally reinvent themselves, which is crucial for their survival. Ample research in other disciplines has shown that perceptions of trust and fear are strong drivers for sharing (or not sharing) creative ideas at work. However, what fosters the sharing and developing of new ideas has been strikingly under-researched in journalism studies. To fill this research gap we ask: how do perceptions of trust and fear in the newsroom stimulate (or not) the sharing and developing of new ideas? Data have been gathered in the newsrooms of two Dutch newspapers, using qualitative interviews and non-participant observation. To enable new idea sharing to benefit all, people need to experience both trust in their peers and in their management. Results show that only newsroom elites perceive both types of trust and, hence, feel free to share their new ideas with management. This means that within newsrooms in transformation the innovative potential of the majority of people is not utilised as they fear to share their creative or new ideas upwards in the hierarchy.","[Porcu, Ornella; Hermans, Liesbeth] Windesheim Univ Appl Sci, Media Res Ctr, Zwolle, Netherlands; [Hermans, Liesbeth] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Fac Social Sci Commun Sci, Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Porcu, Ornella; Broersma, Marcel] Univ Groningen, Ctr Media & Journalism Studies, Groningen, Netherlands",Radboud University Nijmegen; University of Groningen,"Porcu, O (corresponding author), Windesheim Univ Appl Sci, Media Res Ctr, Zwolle, Netherlands.;Porcu, O (corresponding author), Univ Groningen, Ctr Media & Journalism Studies, Groningen, Netherlands.",o.c.porcu@rug.nl,"Porcu, Ornella/GLU-1342-2022","Porcu, Ornella/0000-0001-6384-6095; Broersma, Marcel/0000-0002-7342-3472; Hermans, Liesbeth/0000-0003-4986-9156",,,,,63,0,0,1,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1461-670X,1469-9699,,JOURNALISM STUD,Journal.

News recommender systems provide news organisations with new opportunities to offer more relevant and personalised news experiences, but their increasing use has also raised several concerns about whether and how algorithms should undertake important editorial decisions. Current literature offers only limited empirical insight into the actual use of these technologies in journalism, and this study is the first to map the use of and perceptions on algorithmic news recommendation within the Scandinavian news market. Drawing on interviews with all 19 national newspapers within the Scandinavian daily press, the findings reveal that while most newspapers use news recommender systems in some form, the extent of their use is still limited due to concerns over the shared news sphere and a reluctance to transfer editorial control. Some newspapers address these concerns in the use of news recommendation by upholding traditional gatekeeping control on certain parts of the website, while others have built editorial control into the systems themselves, indicating that Scandinavian newspapers normalise algorithmic news recommendation by adopting a traditional gatekeeping role.","[Moller, Lynge Asbjorn] Aarhus Univ, Sch Commun & Culture, Dept Media & Journalism Studies, Aarhus, Denmark; [Moller, Lynge Asbjorn] Danish Sch Media & Journalism, Aarhus, Denmark",Aarhus University,"Moller, LA (corresponding author), Aarhus Univ, Sch Commun & Culture, Dept Media & Journalism Studies, Aarhus, Denmark.;Moller, LA (corresponding author), Danish Sch Media & Journalism, Aarhus, Denmark.",lyngemoller@cc.au.dk,,"Moller, Lynge Asbjorn/0000-0002-1632-2253",,,,,67,2,2,6,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1461-670X,1469-9699,,JOURNALISM STUD,Journal.

The lockdown disrupted the employment and practices of many journalists in ways that may reveal the contemporary tensions between professional identity and working conditions more clearly than in average news cycles. In order to understand what the Belgian French-speaking journalists went through during the first lockdown, we conducted a survey about the implications of the crisis for their employment status and work practices. This survey also covered their perceptions concerning their social role, their journalistic skills and the quality of their work covering the COVID-19 crisis. The responses show a sharp contrast between challenging working conditions (isolation, lack of expertise and job losses in worst cases) and the satisfaction that comes from the social contribution of their reporting.

Conversely, citizens who have not taken up news in their daily routines rarely form novel patterns of news use. Yet, we know surprisingly little about how news habits come into being, especially in real-life situations. Previous research suggests that considerable life changes and disruptions in daily routines can give rise to the adaptation or formation of habits. This paper asks how and to what extent citizens created novel patterns of news use or adapted existing news routines during the COVID-19 pandemic. Connecting insights from social psychology to journalism and audience studies, it analyzes which affective, social and contextual cues stimulate or hinder news habit formation. Employing a questionnaire with open-ended questions with 1293 Dutch news users, we identified 5 groups of news users whose news habits each demonstrate a different response to the COVID-19 pandemic: news avoiders, followers turned avoiders, stable news users, frequent news users and news junkies. In-depth follow-up interviews with these users (N = 22) show that differences in users' everyday context, social cues, levels of stress and anxiety, and affective cues may explain these different behaviors.","[Broersma, Marcel; Swart, Joelle] Univ Groningen, Ctr Media & Journalism Studies, Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen,"Broersma, M (corresponding author), Univ Groningen, Ctr Media & Journalism Studies, Groningen, Netherlands.",m.j.broersma@rug.nl,,"Broersma, Marcel/0000-0002-7342-3472",,,,,46,9,9,3,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1461-670X,1469-9699,,JOURNALISM STUD,Journal.

Through in-depth semi-structured interviews with 18 Filipino reporters and editors from three influential media outlets that then President Rodrigo Duterte targeted as enemies - the broadcaster ASS-CBN, the newspaper Philippine Daily Inquirer, and the website Rappler - this paper offers novel insights on journalists' counterstrategies with appeals to their strengthened roles as watchdogs, interpreters and disseminators of populist communication. Findings indicate that journalists discard practices like false equivalence and shift roles including from being detached observers to media freedom advocates and truth activists to respond to institutional attacks, rising disinformation, and perceived democratic erosion as they seek to speak truth to a populist in power. The study provides theoretical and empirical contributions by combining paradigm repair and role perceptions as tools in analyzing journalists' responses to legitimacy threats, and by presenting an understudied case of anti-media populism in the Global South.","[Macaraig, Ayee; Hameleers, Michael] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Commun Res ASCoR, Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam,"Hameleers, M (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Commun Res ASCoR, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",m.hameleers@uva.nl,,,,,,,58,0,0,2,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1461-670X,1469-9699,,JOURNALISM STUD,Journal.

The thematic analysis of the data gathered qualitatively by 15 in-depth interviews reveals that most of the safety threats to alternative women journalists stem from security forces in the field and arbitrary judicial sanctions in the courthouses. According to the interviewees, the authoritarian government that sees critical journalism as the greatest enemy controls and oversees these assaults. Furthermore, women journalists suffer from the unsustainable working conditions of alternative news media. Alternative media theories would expect these institutions to be gender-equal and pro-labor, but the prevalent indifference to women's labor and gender rights demonstrates that this normative approach is not justified. However, women still feel encouraged to continue journalism, which they consider an important tool for empowerment not only for themselves but also all otherized identities.

Through an analysis of a development network operating in a public service media organization, we identify characteristics of ILC in the network and how those characteristics manifest in practice, as well as examine contextual factors that shape ILC. Our findings indicate that innovation and learning processes in the network are shaped by journalistic practice, technology and platforms, and organizational strategy. Importantly, the organization's technological environment is seen to encourage mimicry in learning and innovation processes, leading to exploitative rather than explorative innovation.

This epistemology is based on Gadamer's functional hermeneutics, and it advances the concept of source criticism as an alternative to other practices and understandings of information verification in journalism. The article argues that source criticism is a better approach to bridge the gap between news and truth in journalism in a time of information disorder. Source criticism is a common concept in certain journalistic cultures, for instance in Scandinavia, but it needs revision due to current developments in digital information networks. A modern version of source criticism offers great value to journalism as (1) guidelines for the practical assessments of sources and source material, (2) a professional attitude related to what it takes to produce truth-claims, and (3) a tool to perform audits of journalism. The article ends with highlighting three norms for journalistic practice and audits of journalism. These norms, which contain operationalisation of source criticism as journalistic epistemology and methodology, are: (1) harness truth-claims with modesty; (2) deploy interpretive transparency; and (3) operationalise self-reflective truth-claims.","[Steensen, Steen; Westlund, Oscar] Oslo Metropolitan Univ, Dept Journalism & Media Studies, Oslo, Norway; [Belair-Gagnon, Valerie] Univ Minnesota, Hubbard Sch Journalism & Mass Commun, Minneapolis, MN USA; [Graves, Lucas] Univ Wisconsin, Sch Journalism & Mass Commun, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Kalsnes, Bente] Kristiania Univ Coll, Sch Commun Leadership & Mkt, Oslo, Norway",Oslo Metropolitan University (OsloMet); University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; Kristiania University College,"Steensen, S (corresponding author), Oslo Metropolitan Univ, Dept Journalism & Media Studies, Oslo, Norway.",steen@oslomet.no,,,Research Council of Norway [302303],Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway),This work was supported by the Research Council of Norway under grant number 302303.,,61,0,0,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1461-670X,1469-9699,,JOURNALISM STUD,Journal.

Through the examination of reading lists and module descriptions on UK accredited journalism degrees it is revealed, that the subject is dominated by journalism experiences grounded in western nations and that non-white perspectives are largely neglected. There is a discussion of what decolonizing the curriculum entails and a critique of journalism practice in the UK. Finally, there are recommendations to make journalism curricula inclusive based on findings from a project to narrow the attainment gap at De Montfort University. While there have been calls to make journalism education more international in its outlook, the terminology decolonizing is specifically used to denote the undoing of colonial legacies in creating ethnically and racially divided societies. There is a call to educate trainee journalists about racism and structural racism, and the ways it advantages some groups and disadvantages others. This would enable journalists to challenge longstanding biases and omissions that restrict the audience's understanding of politics, histories and societies.","[Aujla-Sidhu, Gurvinder] Univ Derby, Sch Humanities & Journalism, Derby, England",University of Derby,"Aujla-Sidhu, G (corresponding author), Univ Derby, Sch Humanities & Journalism, Derby, England.",G.Aujla-Sidhu@derby.ac.uk,,"Aujla-Sidhu, Gurvinder/0000-0003-4647-6146",,,,,57,1,1,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1461-670X,1469-9699,,JOURNALISM STUD,Journal.

And the authority of cultural critics, whose subjective work evaluates the taste and merit of cultural products including music and film, is complicated by an explosion in cultural production, increased competition for audience attention and the ready availability of amateur culture opinions online. Through in-depth interviews with 44 professional U.S. critics devoted to a wide variety of cultural beats, this study examines the challenges to their cultural and journalistic authority these critics face, as well as the strategies and norms they have developed in order to maintain and reinforce that authority. These challenges include hot takes, performance of the self, amateur competition, and tension surrounding straying too far from their peers. And tactics to strengthen their authority include crafting cultural arguments, pursuing increasingly niche expertise, and supporting diversity and inclusion of non-white-male identities within their ranks.","[Whipple, Kelsey] Univ Massachusetts Amherst, Dept Journalism, Amherst, MA 01003 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst,"Whipple, K (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts Amherst, Dept Journalism, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",kwhipple@umass.edu,,,,,,,51,2,2,1,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1461-670X,1469-9699,,JOURNALISM STUD,Journal.

The article discusses how education institutions draw on journalism education discourse, how they adapt their programs in order to respond to the practical demands of professional journalism in the digital age, and which skills and knowledge are considered as the core of journalism education. In addition, it contributes to journalism theory with the development of a dispositive of journalism. This theoretical framework is employed to interpret the status quo of curricula and teaching practices in relation to journalism practice. The empirical case study of journalism training and education includes a comprehensive content analysis of sixty-seven programs and 1818 individual courses in Austria, and guided interviews with twenty-nine stakeholders about the status quo and the challenges of an adequate journalism education. Results show that the digitalisation of journalism is fully integrated in the curricula and that educators are aware of trends in both education discourse and journalism. The results also point at gaps regarding innovation and the teaching of certain topics, and show possible reasons why education practice lags behind education discourse.","[Kirchhoff, Susanne] Univ Salzburg, Dept Commun Sci, Salzburg, Austria",Salzburg University,"Kirchhoff, S (corresponding author), Univ Salzburg, Dept Commun Sci, Salzburg, Austria.",susanne.kirchhoff@plus.ac.at,,,KommAustria/rtr [KOA 8.064/2018-006],KommAustria/rtr,"This work was supported by the KommAustria/rtr under [Grant Nr.

As an ideological project, this intervention symbolizes both a significant economic and cultural investment. This paper interrogates how venture philanthropists and their investments have been made sense of via metajournalistic discourse. Through a critical discourse analysis of reporting and commentary about venture philanthropy, we find that professional discussions are often notably insular, framing journalism's public values in market-centric terms and establishing funders as transformative figures intervening in a journalistic culture ill-prepared to adapt to the needs of the market. The analysis shows how venture philanthropy works as a site of tech industry influence and ideology in the field of journalism, primarily by demonstrating how the discourse construes publicly focused journalism as existing in part thanks to the largesse and beneficence of the tech companies who structure and extract value from the digital public sphere.","[Creech, Brian] Temple Univ, Lew Klein Coll Media & Commun, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA; [Parks, Perry] Michigan State Univ, Sch Journalism, Lansing, MI USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University; Michigan State University,"Creech, B (corresponding author), Temple Univ, Lew Klein Coll Media & Commun, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA.",brian.creech@temple.edu,"Creech, Brian/AAR-8116-2021","Creech, Brian/0000-0002-0986-6842; Parks, Perry/0000-0003-3958-6793",Donald W.

Through a critical discourse analysis of 76 articles from U.S. newspapers, magazines, and online news sites, this study examines the specific case of a 2019 outburst from Houston Astros assistant general manager Brandon Taubman, who directed pointed praise of an Astros player accused of domestic violence at three female sports journalists, one of whom wore a domestic violence awareness bracelet. By examining news coverage of this prominent incident - and the meta-journalistic discourse that permeated it - this study identified three problematic discursive maneuvers through which journalists avoided directly addressing the topic of patriarchy and its influence in this incident and the wider sports industry, while instead prioritizing issues of journalistic credibility and baseball culture and minimizing domestic violence as strategic distraction.","[Whipple, Kelsey N.] Univ Massachusetts Amherst USA, Dept Journalism, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Graber, Shane S.

We address this research gap in two integrative studies and use HIV reporting in China as a test case. Study 1 is a content analysis of seven newspapers (2000-2015) that sheds light on how words and visuals suggest different frames and journalistic roles. Study 2 uses in-depth interviews with journalists affiliated with the newspapers where the coverage was analyzed in Study 1 to contextualize content-analytical findings. The results paint a nuanced picture of health journalism, suggesting both frame and role multiplicity. Two forms of modality interplay were predominant-namely, redundancy and congruence-while the third, mismatch, was virtually absent. Such findings can be interpreted both positively, as indicative of high-quality journalism, and negatively, as a fear of repercussions.

Fact-checkers face different economic and editorial challenges depending on their organizational environment. Nevertheless, their chief business strategy to gain economic viability mainly translates into a solid presence on digital platforms. It involves reaching niche markets on social media and attracting users to their websites. Last, the limited staff of most fact-checking initiatives and their growing dependence on big tech money have led them to modularize their corrections to different platforms and publish debunking at the expense of political fact-checking.

Pseudo-media that relies on conspiracy theories and misleading versions of the social reality contribute to feeding the disinformation ecosystem by reinforcing biased messages with expressive patterns and polarising practices. This article focuses on the content published (N=1,396) by seven far-right wing Spanish pseudo-media. Based on qualitative and quantitative methods, it analyses headlines, types of text and sources, as well as the distortion strategies of journalistic conventions. Results show that the emotional component is expressed by means of polarised headlines that rely on clickbait to gain attention and build a particular jargon, exacerbated by disinformation and populist practices. The absolute dependence of conspicuous headlines is evidenced by the limited resources of pseudo-media, whose production lies in a mix of opinion text and the processing of online content. Plagiarism from mainstream-mainly conservative-media, social networks and website siblings fuel these outlets that play the role of the ambiguity, mimicking journalistic conventions and mocking them by means of disinformation practices, with a particular focus on reframing social issues, progressive policies and measures to manage the pandemic.","[Palau-Sampio, Dolors] Univ Valencia, Fac Philol Translat & Commun, Language Theory & Commun Sci Dept, Valencia, Spain",University of Valencia,"Palau-Sampio, D (corresponding author), Univ Valencia, Fac Philol Translat & Commun, Language Theory & Commun Sci Dept, Valencia, Spain.",dolors.palau@uv.es,,,,,,,66,0,0,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1751-2786,1751-2794,,JOURNAL PRACT,Journal.

Amid the unprecedented health crisis, visuals play important roles in media framing and health crisis communication. This article provides one of the first analyses of textual-visual news concerning COVID-19 posted by two leading German newspapers on Twitter. Our objective is to integrate texts and visuals into framing analysis to better understand the multimodal news presentation of health crises. A quantitative content analysis of 2479 tweets examined nine news frames, among which politics and instructions, update information, economic impact and social impact presented more thematic salience. The semiotic signs of indexical, symbolic and iconic appeared in news visuals and served evidential, performative and illustrative functions. The results also detected recurrent news visuals in the color-clustered patterns. Notably, an alluvial diagram revealed the connections between textual frames and visual signs across three crisis phases. In recognizing the diverse roles of visuals in constructing mediated reality, this article demonstrates the value in the multimodal framing of health crises and suggests expanding our focus to risk cultures for future international comparative research.","[Xu, Yi; Loeffelholz, Martin] Tech Univ Ilmenau, Inst Media & Commun Sci, Dept Media Studies, Ilmenau, Germany; [Yu, Jingyuan] Tech Univ Ilmenau, Inst Media & Commun Sci, Dept Computat Commun Sci, Ilmenau, Germany",Technische Universitat Ilmenau; Technische Universitat Ilmenau,"Xu, Y (corresponding author), Tech Univ Ilmenau, Inst Media & Commun Sci, Dept Media Studies, Ilmenau, Germany.",yi.xu@tu-ilmenau.de,"Xu, Yi/AHC-6667-2022","Xu, Yi/0000-0003-3099-4168; Loeffelholz, Martin/0000-0002-9228-5677; Yu, Jingyuan/0000-0002-9400-4859",Visual Communication Studies Division,Visual Communication Studies Division,"The previous version of this paper was accepted and presented at the 72nd. annual conference of the International Communication Association (ICA, 2022).

They are a legal provision allowing them to define their ethical principles and conduct, establish their identity and ideology, and create a communication pact with their audiences. Editorial statutes can thus be considered mechanisms of media responsibility, accountability, and transparency. In Portugal, such statutes are legally required and are often perceived as formal, general, and bland documents. This paper presents a study of sixteen editorial statutes of the Portuguese press, designed to understand the issues and values of these documents. Thirty-eight categories were identified across three key dimensions: self-definition, normative values, and ideological elements. While these dimensions seek to address the requirements set out in the Portuguese Media Law, this analysis defies the common concepts of superficiality and homogeneity of editorial statutes.","[Miranda, Joao; Camponez, Carlos] Univ Coimbra, Fac Arts & Humanities, Coimbra, Portugal; [Miranda, Joao; Camponez, Carlos] Univ Coimbra, Ctr Interdisciplinary Studies CEIS20, Coimbra, Portugal",Universidade de Coimbra; Universidade de Coimbra,"Miranda, J (corresponding author), Univ Coimbra, Fac Arts & Humanities, Coimbra, Portugal.;Miranda, J (corresponding author), Univ Coimbra, Ctr Interdisciplinary Studies CEIS20, Coimbra, Portugal.",jmiranda@uc.pt,,"Camponez, Carlos/0000-0003-0832-7174; Miranda, Joao/0000-0002-4720-3724",,,,,63,0,0,0,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1751-2786,1751-2794,,JOURNAL PRACT,Journal.

Interactive documentaries convey information in many innovative formats, yet changing patterns of media consumption and the negative impact of misinformation can reduce their communicative effectiveness. Therefore, this article explores how we can identify different interactive structures and theoretical frameworks to help ensure I-Docs leverage the potential of emerging techniques to communicate climate change content effectively. This is increasingly important as climate change predictions become exponentially severe, and misinformation continues to distort the scientific consensus surrounding climate change during the Anthropocene. We investigate the thematic and structural properties of three interactive documentary works: The Last Generation: Climate Change and the Marshall Islands, This is Climate Change: Melting Ice and Offshore. Our results show how these divergent examples of I-Docs sit within current frameworks of Immersive Journalism and can use complex, nonlinear narrative structures to explore environmental issues. We argue that the gamification of I-Doc work and the embedding of inoculation techniques offer the potential to engage audiences and reduce their susceptibility to climate change misinformation.","[Brannon, Lawrence] Univ Acad 92, Dept Media & Journalism, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Gold, Lisa; Walton, Geoff] Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Fac Arts & Humanities, Languages Informat & Commun, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Magee, Johnny] Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Fac Arts & Humanities, Sch Digital Arts, Manchester, Lancs, England",Manchester Metropolitan University; Manchester Metropolitan University,"Brannon, L (corresponding author), Univ Acad 92, Dept Media & Journalism, Manchester, Lancs, England.",lawrence.brannon@ua92.ac.uk,,"Walton, Geoff/0000-0003-4251-2891",,,,,80,1,1,14,33,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1751-2786,1751-2794,,JOURNAL PRACT,Journal.

Specifically, we studied if there are differences in perception based on adherence to the International Fact-Checking Network's (IFCN) Code of Principles, how frequently fact-checkers perform fact-checks, as well as their experience and age. Data were collected through a questionnaire that received 122 responses from fact-checkers in 17 countries. Results indicate that journalists' experience appears to be a variable that can help understand the boundaries between fact-checking and political and social activism in Ibero-America. Less-experienced fact-checkers were more likely to consider activism to be a purpose of fact-checking. Age was a predictive factor for explaining reformist perceptions of the essence of fact-checking in Ibero-America, with younger fact-checkers more likely to state that the purpose of fact-checking is to uphold the ideals of journalism and serve as a commitment to information transparency. Pledging to adhere to IFCN's Code of Principles was found to facilitate the use and analysis of fact-checking tools.

Recently, however, state hostility is being replaced by non-state actors' aggression against journalists. By framing emerging threats of reporters' safety in Ethiopia within normative vis-a-vis alternative debates of journalism practice in the context of transitional, unstable, pluralistic-partizan societies, this study examines the prevalence of non-state actors in remapping threats of journalistic impunity in Ethiopia. Key findings from interviews conducted with editors, reporters, and other practitioners indicate, while the government cannot be ruled out as a safety threat for journalists, there is an emerging consensus that identifies non-state actors such as vigilante groups, influential social media political personalities, and weaponized media as the most perceptible safety risks to journalism practice. Although threat levels vary depending on journalists' regional affiliation or perceived ethnic identity/political worldview, domestic journalists face increased native othering that amounts to mobility restrictions and physical aggression compared to foreign correspondents.","[Workneh, Tewodros W.] Kent State Univ, Sch Commun Studies, Kent, OH 44242 USA",University System of Ohio; Kent State University; Kent State University Kent; Kent State University Salem,"Workneh, TW (corresponding author), Kent State Univ, Sch Commun Studies, Kent, OH 44242 USA.",tworkneh@kent.edu,"Workneh, Tewodros/AAR-4224-2021","Workneh, Tewodros/0000-0001-8301-2696",,,,,71,2,2,0,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1751-2786,1751-2794,,JOURNAL PRACT,Journal.

Overall, the study found a strong editorial focus on criticising the government's right-wing policy agenda, as well as opposition towards mainstream media - notably BBC news - with political reporting perceived as reinforcing an establishment-led agenda. This opposition to mainstream media has ideological consequences for the UK's media system, with public service broadcasting the biggest casualty.

Based on the statistical analysis of survey responses from 875 Finnish journalists, the results indicate that individual-level factors of age and gender have only a marginal relation to the prevalence of external interference. Of analyzed organizational-level factors-employment type, occupational position, and media outlet used for reporting-the latter two were most significant.

At the same time, the choice to become a journalist in an adverse scenario such as this shows a strong commitment to journalism and a strong adherence to a set of relatively stable features of identity discourse.","[Pereira, Fabio Henrique] Univ Brasilia, Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Pereira, Fabio Henrique] Arenes, Nimes, France; [Pereira, Fabio Henrique] UQAM Canada, CRICIS, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Pereira, Fabio Henrique] E ReSIC ULB Belgium, Brussels, Belgium",Universidade de Brasilia,"Pereira, FH (corresponding author), Univ Brasilia, Brasilia, DF, Brazil.;Pereira, FH (corresponding author), Arenes, Nimes, France.;Pereira, FH (corresponding author), UQAM Canada, CRICIS, Montreal, PQ, Canada.;Pereira, FH (corresponding author), E ReSIC ULB Belgium, Brussels, Belgium.",fabiop@unb.br,"Pereira, FÃ¡bio Henrique/A-2037-2010","Pereira, FÃ¡bio Henrique/0000-0002-2867-0167",National Council for Scientific and Technological (Brazil); Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico,National Council for Scientific and Technological (Brazil); Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)),This work was supported by the National Council for Scientific and Technological (Brazil) under Grant Research Productivity Scholarship; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico.,,48,0,0,1,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1751-2786,1751-2794,,JOURNAL PRACT,Journal.

The movement was started by the people of tribal areas to demand an end to the existing state policies on the US-led war on terror amidst calls for institutional reforms in the region. The study borrows from the existing scholarship on the media representation of social movements and utilizes the protest paradigm as its theoretical framework. Through content analysis and detailed interviews with journalists, the study found the civil rights movement is mainly reported in unfavorable terms in the leading media outlets. While sharing their perspectives on this particular treatment, the journalists believed that the media was tightly controlled by the government to blackout the movement from the mainstream media. Moreover, the organizational and personal opinions of journalists also influenced the negative portrayal. Though the social media has provided alternative avenues to the movement's activists to speak out against the state's policies, the journalists feared that even this limited freedom would not last longer in the face of some upcoming legislation aimed at controlling the country's social media.","[Hussain, Shabir] Bahria Univ Islamabad, Media Studies, Islamabad, Pakistan",,"Hussain, S (corresponding author), Bahria Univ Islamabad, Media Studies, Islamabad, Pakistan.",shasain2@gmail.com,,,,,,,77,0,0,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1751-2786,1751-2794,,JOURNAL PRACT,Journal.

Through in-depth interviews with 30 journalists and editors of 12 party newspapers and analysis of investigative reports about 43 party newspapers' propaganda work, this article finds that the party newspapers mainly used three propaganda strategies. Among them, mobile first is a technical strategy that gives priority to the use of mobile communication platforms and technologies in the whole process of news production and dissemination; digitalizing authoritative and localized information is a content strategy that aims to increase the appeal of party newspapers' content to the citizens; and diversified outsourcing, as a service strategy that provides a series of services to the citizens on behalf of government departments, is an innovation of the propaganda practice of the party newspapers. However, there exists a gap in the performance of party newspapers at different levels in the actual propaganda work, and some of them engage in the practice just for the sake of formality.","[Xu, Kaibin; He, Yuying] Wuhan Univ, Sch Journalism & Commun, Wuhan, Peoples R China",Wuhan University,"Xu, KB (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, Sch Journalism & Commun, Wuhan, Peoples R China.",2103477077@qq.com,"Xu, Kaibin/ABC-6383-2021","Xu, Kaibin/0000-0003-2687-4796",,,,,51,0,0,10,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1751-2786,1751-2794,,JOURNAL PRACT,Journal.

Some of these draw on the concept of live journalism, where both journalists and their stories are presented to a live audience. Various examples in the US and Europe have already been examined; this paper looks at the emergence of live journalism in the UK, and its potential in creating engagement in the public sphere. The authors reflect on two online events they produced as part of their News on Stage project during the Covid-19 pandemic, in which journalists presented previously unpublished stories, using dramatic techniques such as verbatim theatre, stand-up comedy, and soundscapes. Using creative, practice-based research, considered relevant to the study of journalism today, they discuss the experience of staging these events to analyse themes of dramatisation, truthfulness, and connection. The authors use ethnographic research, supplemented with audience and participant feedback, to show that this kind of fusion of journalism and theatre can increase interest and trust in journalism and build closeness with audiences.","[Adams, Catherine] Nottingham Trent Univ, Dept Media Commun & Soc, Nottingham, England; [Cooper, Glenda] City Univ London, Dept Journalism, London, England",Nottingham Trent University; City University London,"Cooper, G (corresponding author), City Univ London, Dept Journalism, London, England.",glenda.cooper.1@city.ac.uk,,,,,,,61,0,0,11,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1751-2786,1751-2794,,JOURNAL PRACT,Journal.

These acts spur hybrid media events where both news media and media users create and share information and interpretations of the event. Large news organizations play an integral role in attracting, steering and regulating attention in hybrid media events of terrorist violence. This article develops a theoretical conceptualization of the news organization as an attention apparatus. We argue that the apparatus consists of two dimensions: First, three conditions constrain the workings of the attention apparatus: perceived audience expectations, professional conditions of journalism and societal responsibilities of journalism. Secondly, there are three temporal affordances through which attention is managed: immediacy, liveness and interruption. We come to these conclusions through empirical research on newsroom practices in terrorism news production at the Finnish Broadcasting Company (Yle). Our data consist of thematic interviews (N = 33) with Yle journalists, producers and content managers as well as newsroom observations (14 days) conducted at Yle News and Current Affairs departments. The data is interpreted through a grounded theory approach. The article highlights how the temporal affordances enable reporting in hybrid media events but also clash with established conditions of news reporting.","[Uusitalo, Niina] Tampere Univ, Fac Informat Technol & Commun Sci, COMET, Tampere, Finland; [Valaskivi, Katja] Univ Helsinki, Fac Theol, Relig & Digital World, Helsinki, Finland",Tampere University; University of Helsinki,"Uusitalo, N (corresponding author), Tampere Univ, Fac Informat Technol & Commun Sci, COMET, Tampere, Finland.",niina.uusitalo@tuni.fi,"Valaskivi, Katja/ABI-6629-2022",,"Academy of Finland [326643, 308850]",Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland),The Hybrid Terrorizing research consortium (HYTE) is funded by the Academy of Finland (funding decisions 326643 and 308850).,,61,6,6,2,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1751-2786,1751-2794,,JOURNAL PRACT,Journal.

Seeking new ways to interact with people previously seen as audience is a big challenge for media and journalists today, especially in local contexts, where journalists are more embedded in the community, physically and digitally, namely through social media and from mobile devices. This study intends to identify how local journalists are using digital tools in their routines, especially when it comes to be close and engaged with communities. To do so, a survey was applied to a sample of journalists (n = 107) from 42 newsrooms from the central region of Portugal, which gathers the most significant presence of local media. Findings point to full integration of the Internet into local journalists' routines as well as social media and mobile. Digital technologies are used essentially for news gathering and to get in touch with sources. Employing social media to engage with the community is true only for a few. The same happens when it comes to recognize or even incorporate content produced by citizens. Local journalists are not always so available to be close to the public as they usually claim.","[Jeronimo, Pedro; Correia, Joao Carlos; Gradim, Anabela] Univ Beira Interior, LabCom, Covilha, Portugal; [Jeronimo, Pedro] CECS, Braga, Portugal",Universidade da Beira Interior,"Jeronimo, P (corresponding author), Univ Beira Interior, LabCom, Covilha, Portugal.;Jeronimo, P (corresponding author), CECS, Braga, Portugal.",pj@ubi.pt,"JerÃ³nimo, Pedro/H-7170-2015; Correia, Joao/H-6609-2013","JerÃ³nimo, Pedro/0000-0003-1900-5031; Correia, Joao/0000-0002-6317-9007",Portugal 2020 Program [CENTRO-01-0145-FEDER031277]; Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia,Portugal 2020 Program; Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia(Portuguese Foundation for Science and TechnologyEuropean Commission),"This paper was developed within the framework of Re/media.

Yet this historic partition is challenged by the deterioration of the old advertiser-sponsored business model. The relationship is growing closer, at the risk of causing psychological discomfort to those involved. This study assesses what happens when senior editors encounter cognitive dissonance as they reconstruct the editorial-commercial relationship. It finds reluctance to embrace this evolving relationship, revealed in the fragmented and contradictory syntax editors use to talk about it as they are torn between the old (ethically driven) norm of how thingsshouldbe, and the emerging (economically driven) norm of how thingsare. Yet, the paper suggests that cognitive dissonance may be the preferred state for any newsworker in an organization tasked with delivering news to a community which is not prepared to pay the full price for it, requiring some form of external subsidy. Rather than being dissonance that requires resolution, it becomes a vital, desirable tension whose perpetuation gives value to work.","[Duffy, Andrew; Rui Jun, Lydia Cheng] Nanyang Technol Univ, Wee Kim Wee Sch Commun & Informat, Singapore, Singapore",Nanyang Technological University & National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore; Nanyang Technological University,"Duffy, A (corresponding author), Nanyang Technol Univ, Wee Kim Wee Sch Commun & Informat, Singapore, Singapore.",duffy@ntu.edu.sg,,"Cheng, Lydia/0000-0002-7468-464X",,,,,65,6,6,4,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1751-2786,1751-2794,,JOURNAL PRACT,Journal.

One of the reasons for the interest is its potential ability to facilitate the public's emotional engagement. However, this seems to come into conflict with the prevailing idea that news should be presented in an emotionally detached manner. The New York Times is a media outlet that, more than most, conjures up notions of professional and high-quality journalism. The present article chooses the NYT Daily 360 project as a case study to examine the tension between traditional journalist ethics and the emotional bias that seems to characterise immersive technology. We conducted a content analysis to identify the elements that, by emphasizing the mediation between the user and the narrated facts, generate a deimmersion effect. As a result, we have observed that, in general, the immersive properties of the videos tend to be mitigated by resources with an opposite effect. Reasoning from this compromise solution between immediacy and hypermediacy, the discussion is based on the problem of the distance between the user and the narrator. To this end, reference is made to theoretical tools from journalism and media studies as well as from art history, literary studies, and semiotics.","[Gonzalez, Rayco] Univ Burgos, Burgos, Spain; [Serra, Marcello] Carlos III Univ Madrid, Madrid, Spain",Universidad de Burgos,"Gonzalez, R (corresponding author), Univ Burgos, Burgos, Spain.",raycogg@ubu.es,,,Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion of Spain [PGC2018-098984-B-I00],"Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion of Spain(Ministry of Science and Innovation, Spain (MICINN)Spanish Government)",This work was supported by Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion of Spain under Grant PGC2018-098984-B-I00.,,78,0,0,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1751-2786,1751-2794,,JOURNAL PRACT,Journal.

To contribute to that debate, we examined how health journalists from the mainstream news organizations in the U.S. used Twitter's @mention for sourcing during the first three months of the COVID-19 outbreak. Using a sample of public Twitter posts published by the journalists, we formed co-@mentioned networks (i.e., two sources were connected if @mentioned in the same post) to examine the structure of the networks and identify important sourcing informants. Among the results, elite sources (e.g., health journalists and health experts in the public sector) and influential users (i.e., verified users with a large number of followers and who post frequently) dominated the sourcing repertoire. Moreover, the networks were fragmented because the sources were clustered into several close-knit subgroups. Analyzing exponential random graph models to examine the formation mechanism of the networks revealed that, as the pandemic's severity increased, influential users played a more salient role in the sourcing repertoire, and a homogeneous cluster consisting of journalists and news organizations emerged.","[Zhang, Xinzhi; Zhu, Rui] Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Sch Commun, Dept Interact Media, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Hong Kong Baptist University,"Zhang, XZ (corresponding author), Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Sch Commun, Dept Interact Media, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",xzzhang2@gmail.com,,,"Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee of the Hong Kong SAR [12602420]","Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee of the Hong Kong SAR","This work was supported by Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee of the Hong Kong SAR: [grant number General Research Fund (GRF) no. 12602420].",,76,0,0,2,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1751-2786,1751-2794,,JOURNAL PRACT,Journal.

This development has given an active voice to audiences and turned journalism more into conversations between journalists and their audiences. The starting observation for this article was that alongside journalists, platforms and audiences play a part in the gatekeeping process that takes place post-publication, and therefore we need to gain a better understanding of this triadic relationship. Furthermore, as conversations are one of the main functions of social media platforms, more understanding of the role of social interaction in post-publication gatekeeping is needed. After analysing posts (N = 180) and their comments on Finnish newspapers' Facebook pages utilising content and digital conversation analysis, we extend the traditional gatekeeping theory to post-publication practices of gatekeeping and finally suggest the concept of conversational gatekeeping. The concept explains how through social interaction journalists and social media audiences are able to build mutual understanding and create norms as well as decide on the content and action that is appropriate or wanted in the public news space formed on the particular online platform.","[Salonen, Margareta; Olbertz-Siitonen, Margarethe; Uskali, Turo] Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Language & Commun Studies, Jyvaskyla, Finland; [Laaksonen, Salla-Maaria] Univ Helsinki, Ctr Consumer Soc Res, Helsinki, Finland",University of Jyvaskyla; University of Helsinki,"Salonen, M (corresponding author), Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Language & Commun Studies, Jyvaskyla, Finland.",margareta.salonen@jyu.fi,,"Olbertz-Siitonen, Margarethe/0000-0002-4222-3638; Salonen, Margareta/0000-0001-9635-2251; Uskali, Turo/0000-0002-2833-7612; Laaksonen, Salla-Maaria/0000-0003-3532-2387",C.V.

Through the lens of data journalism and collaborative journalism, this article relies on methods such as participant observation and in-depth interviews to understand the practices, norms, and routines adopted by La Nacion to produce data journalism focused on environmental topics. The results indicate three specific pillars for such journalism: climate change, biodiversity, and audience participation. The team sets an agenda based on these topics in light of annual events or large celebrations, resulting in a calendar of proposed activities (the production of data stories or crowdsourcing actions). The data team holds meetings with different individuals and organizations from different sectors to identify distinct perspectives on environmental issues to discuss undertakings and collaborate as needed with these actors.

This study contributes to scholarship on this aspect of Asian journalism by expanding knowledge about why journalism becomes no more appealing for aspiring journalists once they land in professional settings. This study took place in Kazakhstan where there was a recent public call to close all journalism programs because they are perceived to fail to prepare qualified professionals and because no single media outlet fully meets professional standards [IREX 2019. Media Sustainability Index: Development of Sustainable Independent Media in Europe and Eurasia. Washington, DC: IREX]. Kazakhstan universities expect news outlets to provide their students with practical experiences, while media outlets expect to receive ready-to-work interns. In this context, aspiring journalists receive little or no professional mentorship, and that has serious negative practical implications for the profession and for democratization efforts in the region. Citing the lack of a near-real world internship experience, the majority of interviewed students plan to switch to other professions.

The methodology is based on participant observation in their workplaces, as well as semi-structured interviews with a purposive sample of 23 managers and employees. The results highlight that both teams manage innovation in their functional organization through learning processes among their professionals and transfer their innovations to other areas of their respective corporations. PSM labs encourage their team members to innovate through a collaborative culture that makes it possible to identify them as Communities of Practice that foster coordinated action and learning in their work.

Drawing from in-depth interviews of 15 journalists based in three South Asian countries-India, Pakistan and Bangladesh the study finds that low wages, inconsistent work and perceived risk/anxiety over security - are the key challenges. The study argues that lack of financial and organizational support from the news media organizations impacts climate change coverage from a vulnerable region like South Asia.

The goal was to identify differences in approaches to acquiring and reporting on data around the world based on comparisons of public data transparency infrastructure. Data journalists from 34 countries were interviewed to understand challenges in data access, strategies used to overcome obstacles, innovation in collaboration, and attitudes about open-data advocacy. Analysis reveals themes of different approaches to journalistic interventionism by overcoming structural obstacles and inventive techniques journalists use to acquire and build their own data sets even in the most restrictive government contexts. Data journalists are increasingly connected with colleagues, third parties, and the public in using data, eschewing notions of competition for collaboration, and using crowdsourcing to address gaps in data. Patterns of direct and indirect activism are highlighted. Results contribute to a better understanding of global data journalism practice by revealing the influence of public data transparency infrastructure as a major factor that constrains or creates opportunities for data journalism practice as a subfield.

This gatekeeping power was not won by journalists in a contest with others, or imposed on audiences, but was instead the unavoidable consequence of structural constraints in the production, distribution, and consumption of news in the pre-digital environment. This article examines this structural selectivity in journalism, identifies the kinds of news stories that may be more difficult to tell selectively and questions whether the structural constraints that require selectivity are still relevant in the digital news ecosystem. A systematic alternative to selective journalism, in which every story within a domain is covered in the same way, is described. Several examples of systematic journalism implemented in newsrooms in the US and UK are provided, and the public service motivations for their systematic coverage is emphasised. Systematic journalism is positioned as fundamentally, not incrementally, different from selective journalism in its characteristics and outcomes, and some of those characteristics are reviewed. A description of systematic journalism as it might be applied to climate change news stories is then developed. Finally, some of the broader challenges and implications of systematic forms of journalism are discussed.","[Caswell, David] British Broadcasting Corp, BBC News Labs, Portland Pl, London, England",,"Caswell, D (corresponding author), British Broadcasting Corp, BBC News Labs, Portland Pl, London, England.",david@structuredstories.com,,,,,,,45,0,0,1,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1751-2786,1751-2794,,JOURNAL PRACT,Journal.

However, the complex and scientific nature of climate change, particularly within a contemporary media setting that includes growing misinformation, has challenged environmental journalists. To better understand these challenges the present study uses the hierarchy of influences model to explore different levels of influence that shape climate content in an under-researched country, Pakistan. Additionally, this study explains reporters' experiences in dealing with misinformation on climate change, its ability to impact their work, and their perception of using fact-checking tools to counter it. The results, based on 21 interviews with self-identified climate journalists, revealed that, on an individual level, lack of expertise and education influence their coverage of environmental issues. Furthermore, the reporters expressed that following the Western process and model of environmental journalism impacts their routine and climate coverage. Moreover, the journalists claimed that advertisers and corporations significantly influence their news stories on environmental issues. The study also reveals that the journalists believed that there is no widespread climate misinformation in Pakistan, thus reducing the need for fact-checkers.

With a limited amount of resources in a highly competitive market, they have been experimenting with diverse game plans to bring traffic to their websites. That includes an aspiration to stand out in an overcrowded market and deliver content that makes them noticeably distinctive. Acknowledging challenges that media organizations face in a contemporary news ecology, this study utilized in-depth interviews with representatives of 10 local digital media in the United States to understand practices in establishing a niche and selecting content to attract users and achieve sustainability. Data suggest that local news outlets that are striving to keep their news operations going have established a niche within the niche. They have done so by focusing on producing original content, which is among the main drivers of reader engagement, subscriptions, and donations to websites. Furthermore, local organizations are open to content produced by volunteers and journalism students due to the small staff they have at their disposal.","[Pantic, Mirjana] Pace Univ, Dyson Coll Arts & Sci, Pleasantville, NY 10570 USA",Pace University,"Pantic, M (corresponding author), Pace Univ, Dyson Coll Arts & Sci, Pleasantville, NY 10570 USA.",mpantic@pace.edu,"Pantic, Mirjana/AAZ-9231-2021",,,,,,35,0,0,2,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1751-2786,1751-2794,,JOURNAL PRACT,Journal.

The magnitude and impact of global warming and rising sea levels is challenging to communicate, and to comprehend, at global and local scales. Media efforts are frustrated by a myriad of factors, including increased audience reliance on social media for news and information and how that can be compromised by brevity or misinformation. Scientific complexity, and political and cultural conflict, along with psychological factors also shape how people engage with climate issues. The situation is exacerbated by a dramatic decline in the number of print and TV local news outlets and loss of journalism jobs, and rising consumer news avoidance and public distaste for negative coverage. Curious Climate is an engaged journalism experiment by Australia's public broadcaster, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), in collaboration with scientific organisations in the island state of Tasmania. The ABC asked the public for climate change questions which were answered with content and events led by scientists. Survey data from audiences and journalists contributes empirical evidence on how such new approaches to audience-led local journalism can deliver relevant local news, expand audiences, and provide trusted, relevant sources of information on complex issues.","[Nettlefold, Jocelyn] Univ Tasmania, Coll Arts Law & Educ, Hobart, Australia; [Nettlefold, Jocelyn] Australian Broadcasting Corp, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Pecl, Gretta T.] Univ Tasmania, Ctr Marine Sociol, Hobart, Australia; [Pecl, Gretta T.] Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Hobart, Australia",University of Tasmania; University of Tasmania,"Nettlefold, J (corresponding author), Univ Tasmania, Coll Arts Law & Educ, Hobart, Australia.;Nettlefold, J (corresponding author), Australian Broadcasting Corp, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",jocelyn.nettlefold@utas.edu.au,"Pecl, Gretta/D-7267-2011","Pecl, Gretta/0000-0003-0192-4339; Nettlefold, Jocelyn/0000-0002-8703-8639",Australian Government; Tasmanian Government through the Tasmanian Climate Change Office; Centre for Marine Socioecology at the University of Tasmania; ARC Future Fellowship,Australian Government(Australian GovernmentCGIAR); Tasmanian Government through the Tasmanian Climate Change Office; Centre for Marine Socioecology at the University of Tasmania; ARC Future Fellowship(Australian Research Council),"This work was supported by a grant from the Australian Government, the Tasmanian Government through the Tasmanian Climate Change Office, and funds from the Centre for Marine Socioecology at the University of Tasmania.

At the routine level, differences are assessed based on whether images are taken by an on-staff photojournalist or a wire photographer. At the individual level, differences are assessed based on the photographer's race and gender. The visual content studied includes three general categories: photojournalistic news values (presence of people, activity of persons of people in the image, whether eye contact is portrayed, emotional hierarchy, and topic), representation (race and gender of people or persons in the image), and visual elevation (circulation of the image in which the image appears, image usage, and image topic).

This article questions if this is inherently so. Empiric material from the Norwegian media coverage of land-based wind power plants in 2018 and 2020 suggests that wind power images are transitioning from green icons to more ambiguous and sometimes downright threatening representations. The visual transformation is particularly salient in the growing body of photojournalistic images, as opposed to photographs from commercial sources such as news agencies and wind power companies. In addition, it seems that even the symbolic meaning of wind power icons is transitioning from representing a hopeful future perfect to symbolizing nature degradation and political arrogance.

Forced to leave their home countries, refugees are now facing environmental and climatic drivers of migration in addition to sociocultural and geopolitical forces. However, in spite of these changes, new narratives of forced displacement and complex refugee identities are often excluded from mediated communications about these important issues. By focusing on the discourse of two distinct objects of analysis, that of nongovernmental organizations and transnational journalism projects across Latin America, this study sought to better understand how news media and important advocates for refugees are framing narratives of forced displacement throughout the region. These findings suggest that complex refugee identities are symbolically annihilated in the construction of news narratives, and new reasons for forced displacement are largely ignored-relying more heavily on homogenous representations and existing frames for Latinx refugees, and only accounting for greater diversity in representations of foreign refugees.","[Wallace, Ryan] Univ Texas Austin, Sch Journalism & Media, Sch Journalism, Austin, TX 78712 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Wallace, R (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, Sch Journalism & Media, Sch Journalism, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",ryanwallace@utexas.edu,,,,,,,44,1,1,2,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1751-2786,1751-2794,,JOURNAL PRACT,Journal.

Based on the collection of primary data through in-depth semi-structured interviews with all the Greek correspondents in Turkey, the findings were conceptualized within the Actor-Network Theory combined with the framework of Histoire Croisee. The results revealed that after the failed coup attempt their work has deteriorated by four major changes: encumbrance of their journalistic role due to their otherness, increase of self-censorship, more workload due to higher demand for stories and extinction of governmental and diplomatic sources. This research claims that the identity of the opponent otherness is a key factor aggravating the practices of foreign correspondents in times of political crises; lastly, it is revealed that when democracy is backsliding, local and foreign journalism are becoming parallelly ill and present a causality effect.","[Pappas, Konstantinos D.] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Journalism & Mass Commun, Thessaloniki, Greece; [Pappas, Konstantinos D.] Univ Arts London, London Coll Commun, London, England",Aristotle University of Thessaloniki; University of Arts London,"Pappas, KD (corresponding author), Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Journalism & Mass Commun, Thessaloniki, Greece.;Pappas, KD (corresponding author), Univ Arts London, London Coll Commun, London, England.",konstan.pappas@gmail.com,,,,,,,81,0,0,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1751-2786,1751-2794,,JOURNAL PRACT,Journal.

But despite its critical importance, local news has faced immense challenges that jeopardize its sustainability in the U.S. This study examines the Colorado media ecology by comparing local news sources across four different counties during Summer 2020 and exploring the factors behind similarities and differences in coverage. Building on Napoli et al.'s (2017) framework to assessing the health of local news, the study uses content analysis to examine original, local reporting and coverage of critical information needs as well as type of framing in over 600 online stories appearing on the home pages of all news sources in the four counties. The findings reveal that the Colorado journalism ecosystem post-Covid outpaces U.S. local news in quality in the pre-Covid era yet aligns with disturbing trends pointing to inequities and disparities. In other words, rural, poorer, and more racially and ethnically diverse Colorado communities tend to have weaker news ecosystems and are more likely to become news deserts. The study also introduces thematic coverage as a necessary dimension to add to journalism quality assessment frameworks and discusses several approaches to salvage local news.","[El Damanhoury, Kareem; Coppini, David; Johnson, Brittany; Rodriguez, Geneva] Univ Denver, Media Film & Journalism Studies Dept, Denver, CO 80208 USA",University of Denver,"El Damanhoury, K (corresponding author), Univ Denver, Media Film & Journalism Studies Dept, Denver, CO 80208 USA.",kareem.eldamanhoury@du.edu,,"El Damanhoury, Kareem/0000-0001-5326-485X",Colorado Trust [37978A-269901],Colorado Trust,This work was supported by Colorado Trust: [Grant Number 37978A-269901].,,92,0,0,7,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1751-2786,1751-2794,,JOURNAL PRACT,Journal.

Chicago, IL was chosen because of the city's struggles with gang violence and with police misconduct, both which have been covered extensively by local news media. Controlling for individual level variables, including previous crime victimization and neighborhood level contexts, a survey of Chicago residents found support for local news' cultivation of residents' fear of crime, particularly by radio and TV. It is suggested that the brief and sensationalistic formats used by news media to report crime stoke residents' fear of crime. Local media also have positive effects on local residents' general attitudes toward police. Regarding a widely publicized incident of police misconduct, this study found that race moderated residents' attitudes toward the White police officer who shot and killed an unarmed Black teenager. The results showed that media shaped negative perceptions of the police only for the non-Caucasians (mostly African Americans) surveyed. It was found that fear of crime only mediated the effects of media on attitudes toward police when the specific event involved an incident of police misconduct, although the effects were minimal.","[Shin, Soo Young; Watson, Brendan R.] Michigan State Univ, Sch Journalism, Coll Commun Arts & Sci, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Michigan State University,"Shin, SY (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Sch Journalism, Coll Commun Arts & Sci, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",shinsoo2@msu.edu,,,Mass Communication & Society Division of the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication,Mass Communication & Society Division of the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication,This work was supported by the Mass Communication & Society Division of the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication (https://aejmc.us/mcs/awards/research-awards/research-award/).,,49,0,0,6,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1751-2786,1751-2794,,JOURNAL PRACT,Journal.

Opinions were more polarized on the potential for oil workers to become climate heroes. While some suggested a conditional form of heroism, the heroes of tomorrow, based on the willingness of the workers to transition, others focused on the bravery of oil workers in seeking dialogue with their counterparts in the climate debate and thus becoming the heroes of couples therapy.","[Ytterstad, Andreas] Oslo Metropolitan Univ, Dept Journalism & Media Studies, Oslo, Norway; [Houeland, Camilla; Jordhus-Lier, David] Univ Oslo, Dept Sociol & Human Geog, Oslo, Norway",Oslo Metropolitan University (OsloMet); University of Oslo,"Ytterstad, A (corresponding author), Oslo Metropolitan Univ, Dept Journalism & Media Studies, Oslo, Norway.",andreasy@oslomet.no,,"Houeland, Camilla/0000-0002-3027-1608",Norges Forskningsrad [283345],Norges Forskningsrad,This work was supported by Norges Forskningsrad: [grant number 283345].,,37,1,1,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1751-2786,1751-2794,,JOURNAL PRACT,Journal.

Our results stress the importance of (1) personal commitment of people in leading positions, (2) close monitoring as a base for strategic management, (3) acknowledgment and promotion of different perspectives in daily newsroom routines, and (4) the reflection and addressing of structural inequalities inside and outside the organization.","[Lueck, Julia; Schultz, Tanjev; Kieslich, Sabine] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Dept Journalism & Commun, Mainz, Germany; [Simon, Felix; Borchardt, Alexandra] Univ Oxford, Reuters Inst Study Journalism, Oxford, England",Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz; University of Oxford,"Luck, J (corresponding author), Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Dept Journalism & Commun, Mainz, Germany.",jlueck@uni-mainz.de,,,Deutsche Telekom Foundation [03 009 74],Deutsche Telekom Foundation,This work was supported by the Deutsche Telekom Foundation (grant number 03 009 74).,,37,0,0,1,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1751-2786,1751-2794,,JOURNAL PRACT,Journal.

Defined as news that is created with virtual reality, augmented reality, mixed reality, and 360 degrees video technologies, research has tended to focus on ways to define it, and its effects on audiences and journalists. Understanding the extent to which immersive journalism adheres to long-held news values, norms, roles, and routines in journalism is essential as part of boundary work, where boundaries that form the essence of journalism legitimize the profession and help journalists understand their work. This study examines 200 immersive stories from five prominent news organizations leading in their production of immersive stories, The New York Times, USA Today, CNN, BBC and The Washington Post. Results indicate that immersive stories remain timely and tend to focus on what is unusual or of human interest. When it comes to sources, there is a shift away from government voices towards civil society. Notably, however, while high on displaying objectivity, there is a lack of source and process transparency in immersive stories, and the infotainment role ranks high, presenting some concerns for journalistic practice.","[Wu, Shangyuan] Natl Univ Singapore, Fac Arts & Social Sci, Dept Commun & New Media, Singapore, Singapore",National University of Singapore,"Wu, SY (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, Fac Arts & Social Sci, Dept Commun & New Media, Singapore, Singapore.",shanwu@nus.edu.sg,,,,,,,93,0,0,1,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1751-2786,1751-2794,,JOURNAL PRACT,Journal.

However, there is very little detailed scholarship about these sites. We carried out semi-structured interviews with senior representatives of 14 online information sites, based in the United States, United Kingdom and other countries, which prioritize the provision of climate information following journalistic values. Through qualitative analysis of the interviews, we show how the sites carve out their niche authority and distinctive nature by emphasizing (to different degrees) their scientific expertise, relevance for policy communication, and their complementary contribution to the work of mainstream journalism. They offer a multiplicity of specialized content, broadly divided into certain, often discrete, aspects of climate change. The self-declared role perceptions of the interviewees suggest that traditional, professional journalistic values eschewing overt advocacy still predominate, although some of the practices, norms and priorities associated with these values have shifted, particularly in their roles as effective and authoritative mediators of climate science. At the theoretical level, the findings highlight the need to study the niche at the intersection of broader dimensions of authority, power and knowledge in changing media ecologies.","[Painter, James] Univ Oxford, Reuters Inst Study Journalism, Oxford, England; [Painter, James] Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, Oxford, England; [Kangas, Jarkko] Univ Helsinki, Fac Social Sci, Helsinki, Finland; [Kunelius, Risto] Univ Helsinki, Helsinki Inst Social Sci & Human, Helsinki, Finland; [Russell, Adrienne] Univ Washington, Ctr Commun & Civic Engagement, Seattle, WA USA",University of Oxford; University of Oxford; University of Helsinki; University of Helsinki; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Painter, J (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Reuters Inst Study Journalism, Oxford, England.;Painter, J (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, Oxford, England.",james.painter@politics.ox.ac.uk,,,Helsingin Sanomat Foundation; Academy of Finland [SA 345905],Helsingin Sanomat Foundation; Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland),"This project was funded by a grant from The Helsingin Sanomat Foundation (Project: Expertise, activism and policy.

Bilkis Banu's gang rape case was one of the few cases covered by the media where the victim belonged to a minority community. Banu, a young Muslim woman was gang raped in 2002 by a mob of hardline Hindu men, as she was fleeing her riot-torn village in Gujarat. Using the intersectional lens, this paper analyzes the news discourse in the Bilkis Banu gang rape case as covered by the Times of India over a period of 17 years. It endeavors to understand the impact of politicized religion in the construction of Muslim women's intersectional identity as victims of sexual assault in the media. The dominant narratives within this news discourse suggest that Banu's experience as a victim of sexual violence is intentionally ignored on account of her religious identity. Additionally, in-depth interviews with journalists at English-language publications in India discuss issues related to access and stigma that are linked to the victim's social status.","[Fadnis, Deepa] Univ Hartford, Sch Commun, Hartford, CT 06117 USA",University of Hartford,"Fadnis, D (corresponding author), Univ Hartford, Sch Commun, Hartford, CT 06117 USA.",fadnis@hartford.edu,,,,,,,111,0,0,1,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1751-2786,1751-2794,,JOURNAL PRACT,Journal.

Descriptive statistics of percentage and a non-parametric test of Chi-square were computed to see the extent and distributions of different variables across categories, and interpretations were mainly made in light of the constructs of social identity theory and hierarchy of influences model. Journalism of activism has become an emerging trend so that the ethnic orientation seems to overwhelm the ethical underpinnings. Ethnically affiliated polarization and political parallelism seem to prevail in the media landscape. Journalists' professional identity appears to be compromised at the expense of ethnic solidarity.

The paper explores the extent to which a shift from print to digital distribution has altered the practice of journalism. Contrary to the widely-held view which stresses the transformational nature of the shift, the results of this analysis show that there are more commonalities than differences between offline and online journalism. There were some changes to the printed versions between 2012 and 2018 but reports in the news applications remained in most respects close to those in the printed newspapers. There were changes in the way that news was presented, notably the use of more illustrations and emotion-driven expressions and markers. But there were no significant differences in terms of substantial dimensions of content, including the pattern of the sources used, the depth of the contexts and orientation of the reports. The use of distinctive online affordances, like hyperlinks, was found to be infrequent.","[Wang, Haiyan] Univ Macau, Fac Social Sci, Dept Commun, Macau, Peoples R China",University of Macau,"Wang, HY (corresponding author), Univ Macau, Fac Social Sci, Dept Commun, Macau, Peoples R China.",haiyan.wang2009@gmail.com,,,Hong Kong RGC's GRF [HKBU 12605317],Hong Kong RGC's GRF,"The research and publication of this article was supported by Hong Kong RGC's GRF grant on Changing media, changing audience: how Chinese journalists perceive, address and interact with their audience in the online environment (grant number HKBU 12605317)",,58,1,1,8,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1751-2786,1751-2794,,JOURNAL PRACT,Journal.

Taking a sample of official short videos from 31 provincial TV stations in China, this paper uses the narrative analysis method to decode the videos. It is found that short videos create a unique news space which are reflected in narrative language, narrative framework and narrative theme, respectively. This study argues that the short video platform has shaped a place with public vitality, participated in local image management, and built the visible community. This has innovated the existing theoretical relationship between news and place, and the short video media practice of TV stations in various provinces has provided the world with the Chinese experience of creating place.","[Liu, Yutan; Zhang, Zheng] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Journalism & Commun, Beijing, Peoples R China",Tsinghua University,"Zhang, Z (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Sch Journalism & Commun, Beijing, Peoples R China.",zhangzheng@tsinghua.edu.cn,,,,,,,60,0,0,3,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1751-2786,1751-2794,,JOURNAL PRACT,Journal.

Using the case study of coverage of Hurricane Florence, this analysis assesses how hurricane news coverage may be potentially motivating or demotivating audiences to pursue behaviors such as preparing for hurricanes, evacuating if need be, helping neighbors with fewer resources, and aiding in recovery efforts.

Of central concern are how journalists understand their roles in communication relating to Covid-19 and how these roles are shaped when the pandemic and trends towards democratic backsliding coincide in time. The analysis is conducted in the theoretical frameworks of crisis communication, authoritarian influences on the media, and journalistic roles, while methodologically it is based on individual interviews in which journalists reflect on their professionalism amidst the pandemic and rising authoritarian control over media. The findings show that the facilitative role revealed in existing research of media functioning during a public health crisis may be interwoven with a watchdog role challenged by authoritarian tendencies. Indeed, interviews suggested the coexistence of general journalistic roles at a time of dual crisis, when the sense of responsibility to facilitate measures to confine the spread of the disease is coupled with critical monitoring, (self)reflection, and attempts to restore professional standards in both public and private media.","[Pajnik, Mojca] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Social Sci, Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Hrzenjak, Majda] Peace Inst, Inst Contemporary Social & Polit Studies, Ljubljana, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana,"Pajnik, M (corresponding author), Univ Ljubljana, Fac Social Sci, Ljubljana, Slovenia.",mojca.pajnik@mirovni-institut.si,,,"Norface Network [2021-2023, 462-19-080]; Slovenian Research Agency [J5-9445, P5-0413]",Norface Network; Slovenian Research Agency(Slovenian Research Agency - Slovenia),"This work was supported by Norface Network [grant number 2021-2023, 462-19-080]; Slovenian Research Agency [grant number J5-9445, P5-0413].",,39,0,0,6,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1751-2786,1751-2794,,JOURNAL PRACT,Journal.

While the public generally wants climate reporting to live up to the same functions as general reporting such as fact-checking and dissemination information quickly, but they also find some functions to be more relevant for climate reporting than for general reporting.

In examining the causes of low media trust, researchers often look at intrinsic audience factors rather than audience perceptions of journalism-in particular, documenting media trust's strong inverse correlation with conservatism, but seldom investigating trust's relationship with perceptions of journalistic quality. The quality connection is worth investigating because studies have found that journalistic errors are common, and such inaccuracies are also widely perceived. This study asked which has a stronger impact on media trust, audience ideologies or perceived journalistic errors. Using a survey of 1026 U.S. adults, the study found an inverse relationship between error perceptions and trust levels. The most frequently perceived errors were sensationalized or understated stories and stories missing essential information. Three types of errors and both social and economic conservatism were found to have statistically significant, negative relationships with trust, while a fourth error type-misspellings-had a positive relationship. The two ideological factors had a slightly stronger media trust impact than the collective error types. Nonetheless, perception of errors accounted for significant variation in trust levels. These results bolster the imperative for rigorous reporting and editing.","[Wilner, Tamar; Wallace, Ryan; Goldstein, Emily] Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Lacasa-Mas, Ivan] Univ Int Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; Universitat Internacional de Catalunya (UIC),"Wilner, T (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",tamar.wilner@utexas.edu,"; Lacasa-Mas, Ivan/D-1615-2012","Wallace, Ryan/0000-0003-1795-759X; Wilner, Tamar/0000-0001-5107-6556; Lacasa-Mas, Ivan/0000-0002-9600-6049","Center for Media Engagement, Moody College of Communication, University of Texas at Austin; Graduate School, University of Texas at Austin","Center for Media Engagement, Moody College of Communication, University of Texas at Austin; Graduate School, University of Texas at Austin","This work was supported by Center for Media Engagement, Moody College of Communication, University of Texas at Austin; Graduate School, University of Texas at Austin.",,93,4,4,5,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1751-2786,1751-2794,,JOURNAL PRACT,Journal.

Based on two face-to-face focus groups and one online focus group made up of Spanish people between the ages of 25 and 54, this qualitative research study explored the behaviour of regular citizens when assessing the truthfulness of health-related news, and their habits about believing it. The results reveal that younger people tended to distrust the ability of older people to spot false content, and vice versa. They also show that people with a higher educational level were more confident about their own immunity to disinformation.

Between 74 and 77% of journalists had experienced some form of distress to at least some degree, and 28-47% had severe problems related to one or more distress subtype. Feeling isolated, anxious, or worn out were most frequent. Distress of all six subtypes was significantly more common among females.

And, how has this incident changed their everyday journalistic practices and routines when it comes to achieving and maintaining safety? We identified 12 coping actions which, based on their function, were organised into five higher order families of coping: emotional purging; sharing and support seeking; avoidance and displacement; defiance and defence; and spreading the legacy and giving meaning to the tragedy. Regarding safety and security practices, the journalists claim that their approach has fundamentally changed. A variety of measures to stay safe, both online and offline, were adopted both on the organisational and on the individual level. However, many of these measures are not used consistently, mostly because they are not deemed necessary when covering non-sensitive topics, but also because of their impracticality in everyday journalistic work, and sceptical and fatalistic approach of the journalists to safety.","[Urbanikova, Marina; Hanikova, Lenka] Masaryk Univ, Fac Social Studies, Dept Media Studies & Journalism, Brno, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Urbanikova, M (corresponding author), Masaryk Univ, Fac Social Studies, Dept Media Studies & Journalism, Brno, Czech Republic.",urbaniko@fss.muni.cz,"Urbanikova, Marina/S-6490-2019","Urbanikova, Marina/0000-0003-1640-9823",,,,,42,1,1,1,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1751-2786,1751-2794,,JOURNAL PRACT,Journal.

The Australian Broadcasting Corporation's (ABC) foray into slow journalism over the last several years via the Remote Communities Project (RCP) enables reporters to spend up to two weeks in a remote or rural community and find what the project management team call the untold stories. As part of a research project investigating the RCP, 15 journalists, producers and managers from the ABC were interviewed. When these participants were asked to reflect upon their understanding of slow journalism, several themes emerged: this form entails a change in practice; the importance of community engagement; and the ability to invest time in finding and developing stories. This article reports on those themes through the lens of participant reflection and Pierre Bourdieu's cultural production model to develop a better understanding of how reporters who undertook projects for the RCP view the process of slow journalism and implications for journalistic practice.","[Fulton, Janet; Scott, Paul] Univ Newcastle, Sch Creat Ind, Newcastle, NSW, Australia",University of Newcastle,"Fulton, J (corresponding author), Univ Newcastle, Sch Creat Ind, Newcastle, NSW, Australia.",janet.fulton@newcastle.edu.au,"FULTON, JANET/G-7854-2013","FULTON, JANET/0000-0001-8686-3023",,,,,56,1,1,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1751-2786,1751-2794,,JOURNAL PRACT,Journal.

Specifically, the study seeks to identify the different ways in which sex work, sex workers and their clients are constructed and examine how the news media orchestrate, coordinate and perpetuate male dominance through the portrayal of the sexuality of men and women. The study employed a qualitative method in the analysis of news contents from three news outlets in Nigeria. Data from the content analysis were triangulated with those from in-depth interviews with newsroom professionals and those generated through the documentary research method. The study found that sex work is constructed as a gendered profession, and the media help to systematically sustain the culture of hegemonic masculinity by re-echoing biased ascriptions between the women who provide sex services and the men who patronise these services. The study concludes that news media accentuate their power by pushing the women into deeper marginalisation through negative labelling and stereotyping. Such organised mediated victimisation of the women folks amplifies and perpetrates the male dominance. These findings have important theoretical and practical implications for overcoming discrimination and marginalisation of women in the society at both micro and macro levels.","[Emmanuel, Nathan Oguche] Natl Open Univ Nigeria, Fac Social Sci, Dept Mass Commun, Abuja, Nigeria; [Suleiman, Hashim Muhammad] Ahmadu Bello Univ, Fac Social Sci, Dept Mass Commun, Zaria, Nigeria; [Gever, Celestine Verlumun] Univ Nigeria, Fac Arts, Dept Mass Commun, Nsukka, Nigeria",Ahmadu Bello University; University of Nigeria,"Emmanuel, NO (corresponding author), Natl Open Univ Nigeria, Fac Social Sci, Dept Mass Commun, Abuja, Nigeria.",emmnatslinks@gmail.com,"Suleiman, PhD, Hashim Muhammad/GZK-6758-2022; Gever, Verlumun Celestine/T-6151-2017","Suleiman, PhD, Hashim Muhammad/0000-0001-5879-178X; Gever, Verlumun Celestine/0000-0003-0618-5352; Emmanuel, Nathan Oguche/0000-0001-8352-8510",,,,,122,0,0,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1751-2786,1751-2794,,JOURNAL PRACT,Journal.

This is similar yet different to the more traditional notion of credibility: while credibility has connotations of truth-telling and unbiased reporting, authenticity points to other features, such as genuineness, intimacy, and, notoriously, trust, derived from what is regarded as an honest self. This article discusses the shift from a theoretical perspective and through an analysis of newspaper pieces written around the Irish Abortion Referendum of 2018. While some of these stories could be uncritically framed in the tradition of the so-called personal essay that is associated with click-bait journalism and cheap content, the article proposes that they present personal stories as a form of witnessing (Peters 2001) and bearing witness (Tait 2011), both of the journalists and writers' own experiences and the experiences of others. The reflective tone becomes a dialogical form of correspondence between the author and the reader, where authenticity is derived in the relationship between the writer, the text, and the audience.","[Vodanovic, Lucia] London Coll Commun UAL, Journalism & Publishing, London, England",,"Vodanovic, L (corresponding author), London Coll Commun UAL, Journalism & Publishing, London, England.",l.vodanovic@lcc.arts.ac.uk,,,,,,,66,0,0,0,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1751-2786,1751-2794,,JOURNAL PRACT,Journal.

Scholars have specifically warned about the dangers of misleading post-event information, because such erroneous messages could lead to reconstruction of eyewitness memory. Whereas much research on false post-event information is focused on eyewitness testimony in police investigations, the role of news media in influencing eyewitness memory has not been fully explored. Almost no eyewitness misinformation research has been placed in journalistic contexts, whereas journalists have two paths to induce false memories: they can influence eyewitness memory by asking misleading questions and by publishing false eyewitness accounts. This manuscript is intended as a call to action for interdisciplinary approaches in studying journalistic routines that may influence eyewitness memory.","[Blom, Robin] Ball State Univ, Dept Journalism, Muncie, IN 47306 USA",Ball State University,"Blom, R (corresponding author), Ball State Univ, Dept Journalism, Muncie, IN 47306 USA.",rblom@bsu.edu,,"Blom, Robin/0000-0001-5559-3569",,,,,120,1,1,2,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1751-2786,1751-2794,,JOURNAL PRACT,Journal.

Findings were drawn from nine semi-structured in-depth interviews with journalists working with local and regional dailies. Weischenberg's model of contextual layers of journalism provides theoretical underpinnings to capture normative, structural, and functional insights as well as data journalists' role conceptions. Results show that viable data is scarce at a local level and data journalists actively seek to maintain good relationships with local authorities to be granted access to data. The practice of data journalism at the local level depends on a few data journalism advocates who institutionalise the practice in their local newsrooms and take training on their own initiative. Local data journalists face similar constraints to their colleagues working for national organisations. Data-driven newswork is carried out in addition to regular duties, and collaboration with specialist correspondents who work on-site is widely reported. We find that the combination of traditional shoe-leather epistemologies of on-site reporting with data-driven practices can add to the independence and neutrality of local journalism.","[Stalph, Florian] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Media & Commun, Munich, Germany; [Hahn, Oliver; Liewehr, David] Univ Passau, Ctr Media & Commun, Passau, Germany",University of Munich; University of Passau,"Stalph, F (corresponding author), Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Media & Commun, Munich, Germany.",florian.stalph@ifkw.lmu.de,,"Stalph, Florian/0000-0003-4018-0918",,,,,68,1,1,4,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1751-2786,1751-2794,,JOURNAL PRACT,Journal.

It dominated the Greek public discourse for several years to the extent that it was ascribed to being used as a tool for electoral power. In spite of its significance, no research has focused on investigating the news coverage of this event. This research paper examines the news discourse of the Mati Wildfire by studying 1,573 news articles, using ideological discourse analysis (IDA). It analyzes the dominant narratives and constructions of the nine most prominent news websites in Greece and reveals if there is a systemic undermining of human impact on the environment. The findings showed that the news outlets did not cover the wildfire as an environmental event, but rather a political issue. The disseminated constructions were of a populistic discourse that supported a polarized logic of a positive image for a particular group (i.e., the main opposition party) and a negative one for the outgroup (i.e., the then-government). As a result, the study emphasizes how crucial it is for journalists to critically explain the role and effects of human activity on the environment (Anthropocene), instead of simply focusing on political or otherwise discussion of events.","[Karyotakis, Minos-Athanasios] Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Sch Commun, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Hong Kong Baptist University,"Karyotakis, MA (corresponding author), Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Sch Commun, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",minosathkar@yahoo.gr,,"Karyotakis, Minos-Athanasios/0000-0002-5197-9445",Hong Kong PhD Fellowship Scheme (HKPFS),Hong Kong PhD Fellowship Scheme (HKPFS),"This article is based on research undertaken by the author while a doctoral student at Hong Kong Baptist University, supported by the Hong Kong PhD Fellowship Scheme (HKPFS).

Thus, the experts routinely used in economic journalism wield power when defining the economic reality and the possibilities for policy-making. Building on 19 semi-structured interviews with Finnish economic and political journalists and a questionnaire survey conducted among journalists (N=42), this article contributes to the existing literature on journalism practice and economic expertise by analysing how journalists perceive the credibility of various economic experts. The article draws from literature on the hierarchy of credibility concept and argues that journalists regard experts working for government authorities and research institutes as more credible than economic experts employed by, for example, private banks. The article argues that while a hierarchy of credibility exists among economic expert groups, it is difficult to make clear-cut demarcations between objective expertise and advocacy in economic journalism. Such results highlight the need for nuanced analyses on the role of economic expertise in journalism practice and in public life.","[Harjuniemi, Timo] Univ Helsinki, Media & Commun studies, Helsinki, Finland",University of Helsinki,"Harjuniemi, T (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Media & Commun studies, Helsinki, Finland.",timo.harjuniemi@helsinki.fi,,,Helsingin Sanomain saatio (Helsingin Sanomat Foundation); Palkansaajasaatio,Helsingin Sanomain saatio (Helsingin Sanomat Foundation); Palkansaajasaatio,This work was supported by Helsingin Sanomain saatio (Helsingin Sanomat Foundation) and Palkansaajasaatio.,,71,0,0,1,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1751-2786,1751-2794,,JOURNAL PRACT,Journal.

Our research reveals that Twitter uses can be classified in four distinct categories. The latter correspond to four specific moments of the news production process: the identification of newsworthy content and relevant sources, the collaborative verification of information, the writing of the article. However, journalists unanimously address these uses through very different attitudes, from full acceptance to strong reticence. Specifically, althoughwitter is largely used as a starting point to news identification, reservations are prevalent when it comes to its use as a source, or as a means to identify sources. Reluctance concerns collaborative verification of information and informative crowdsourcing on Twitter. Major reservations refer to the platform's low credibility and lack of trust. The research draws on testimonies from journalists (semi-directive interviews), which shed light to the way they perceive their practices. Analyses of articles written by the interviewees are also included, with the aim to better understand how Twitter-originated quotes are incorporated in their texts.","[Hernandez-Fuentes, Alejandra; Monnier, Angeliki] Univ Lorraine, Informat Commun, Ctr Res Mediat CREM, Metz, France",Universite de Lorraine,"Hernandez-Fuentes, A (corresponding author), Univ Lorraine, Informat Commun, Ctr Res Mediat CREM, Metz, France.",alejandra-maria.hernandez-fuentes@univ-lorraine.fr,,,"University of Lorraine, Metz, France [UL-EDHNFBCLCS-2018]","University of Lorraine, Metz, France","This research is supported by the University of Lorraine, Metz, France [grant number UL-EDHNFBCLCS-2018].",,69,6,6,1,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1751-2786,1751-2794,,JOURNAL PRACT,Journal.

Threats to safety drive journalists to self-censorship and to use extreme caution. Here I propose that the problem of journalists' safety is worse and more complex today than in the recent past. This explains why the problem has received growing attention globally, and why it is hard to find solutions. A growing academic and grey literature continues to demonstrate that violence is a sprawling problem, and the challenges for implementing effective, sustainable solutions to confront a multidimensional problem, with local and national particularities.

The law, which sparked a legal battle between the government and that nation's most powerful media corporation, aimed to democratize the airwaves and to increase plurality and inclusion. To explore the sources used in the stories covering the law, data were collected from three national newspapers' online publications (Clarin, La Nocion, and Pagina/12), between 1 March 2009, and 29 October 2013. Each newspaper's online database was employed to identify articles about the ACSL. Results from the analysis suggest that the quantity of sources varied significantly across the three papers. Further analysis revealed that at the beginning of the controversy all newspapers used similar sources, but as the discussion progressed, Pagina/12 (liberal, more supportive of the law) tended to use more government officials while La Nacion and Clarin (conservative, opposed to the law) tended to use oppositional leaders, unnamed sources, and media organizations associated with the conglomerates.","[De Maio, Mariana] Lehigh Univ, Dept Journalism & Commun, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA; [Wanta, Wayne] Univ Florida, Dept Journalism, Gainesville, FL USA",Lehigh University; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"De Maio, M (corresponding author), Lehigh Univ, Dept Journalism & Commun, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA.",mariana.demaio@lehigh.edu,,"De Maio, Mariana/0000-0002-5033-8574",,,,,53,0,0,2,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1751-2786,1751-2794,,JOURNAL PRACT,Journal.

The current study examined 418 American newspapers the following day and whether the team's 2019 repeat victory was enough to warrant front-page coverage. Guided by framing theory, this content analysis indicated the victory was significantly represented on front pages and offered a snapshot of how international success in women's sport can result in increased media attention in the U.S. The framing specific to the USWNT presented positive signs for representation. However, when attention focused on non-USWNT sports, gender disparity in overall coverage represented a long-standing trope to diminish quantity and quality of coverage of women's sports. Within a nation that gravitates toward American exceptionalism in sport, this study highlighted that even winning-if it is within women's sports-leaves room for journalistic debate whether that accomplishment merits front-page attention, and it hinted at the recurring journalistic ideology that has historically and systematically underrepresented women throughout modern history.","[Bell, Travis R.] Univ S Florida, Zimmerman Sch Advertising & Mass Commun, Tampa, FL 33620 USA; [Coche, Roxane] Univ Florida, Coll Journalism & Commun, Gainesville, FL USA",State University System of Florida; University of South Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Bell, TR (corresponding author), Univ S Florida, Zimmerman Sch Advertising & Mass Commun, Tampa, FL 33620 USA.",trbell@usf.edu,,,,,,,54,1,1,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1751-2786,1751-2794,,JOURNAL PRACT,Journal.

In order to examine these questions, this study presents a longitudinal field experiment with two survey waves and tracking data of the respondents' consumption of a free membership to a Danish slow news media. Results show that slow news is most likely to attract consumers already engaged with news and that consumption to some extent is increasing their news fatigue.

The majority say that Black athletes are negatively stereotyped and that, as Black journalists, they have an easier time relating to and telling the story of the Black athlete. Using a thematic analysis of the open-ended comments, the authors found perspective, realization of racism, discriminatory hiring practices, and emotional labor to be common themes. Findings from this mixed methods study point to their belief that hiring more Black television sports journalists could improve coverage of Black athletes, but there are doubts that those job opportunities exist. When discussing their own experiences, the Black television sports journalists said there is some tokenism within television station hiring practices that makes it difficult for many of them to be hired.

Integrating cultural representation theory and foreign news proximity-distance approaches, this research focuses on differences in media coverage of AS in the EU between mainstream, community, and social media, and then suggests a model and theoretical implications. The sample included 340 Hebrew language news items from television, print and online newspapers, radio broadcasts, and social media posts from 2011 to 2019. A thematic analysis was conducted. Based on theory of representation, this study found that AS are presented as Others in two different ways based on media type. Community and social media seek to productively compare the Other (AS) to Israelis to encourage concern over Israeli identity and values. In contrast, mainstream media promote narratives that do not invite comparisons-either tacit or explicit-to Israel. Based on proximity-distance approaches, we found that mainstream media content is appropriated by social and community media for different rhetorical ends using a scale of proximity ranging from hostile to hospitable. Community and social media used mainly domestication rhetoric in contrast to mainstream media, which distance the issue, covering it as newsworthy.","[Aharoni, Matan; Lissitsa, Sabina] Ariel Univ, Moskowitz Sch Commun, Ariel, Israel",Ariel University,"Aharoni, M (corresponding author), Ariel Univ, Moskowitz Sch Commun, Ariel, Israel.",matanah@ariel.ac.il,"Aharoni, Matan/ABB-2338-2020","Aharoni, Matan/0000-0003-3214-1353",,,,,61,1,1,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1751-2786,1751-2794,,JOURNAL PRACT,Journal.

The goal of this study is to empirically assess the degree to which news readers make visual contact with cues signifying article type, usually with the word analysis above the headline. Specifically, the eye movement of 250 college-going US news readers was tracked to determine if they cast their gaze on the textual cues used by two major online newspapers to signify article type. Results revealed that news readers infrequently made eye contact with such cues.

However, the rise of social media platforms redirected researchers' attention away from the open web, where hyperlinks played an essential role, to other corners of the digital ecosystem. As a result, research on the use of hyperlinks in news has waned in recent years, despite the continuing and frequent use of hyperlinks in digital news, and their role as connectors between social media and news media. We aim to fill that gap in the recent research literature on hyperlinks' use in news through a multinational computational analysis. Analyzing 1,481,969 hyperlinks from 579,294 stories in 869 sources across seven countries in five continents, we found that, despite significant variations across countries, hyperlinking is quite prevalent in digital news, that external links are more prevalent than previously found, and that US sites and social media platforms are frequent targets of hyperlinks across the world.","[Bhargava, Rahul; Chesnutt, Kathleen; Jefferies, Danica; Ndulue, Emily Boardman] Northeastern Univ, Sch Journalism, Boston, MA USA; [Bermejo, Fernando] IE Univ, Communicat Media & Mkt, Madrid, Spain; [Bermejo, Fernando; Ndulue, Emily Boardman] Media EcoSyst Anal Grp, Washington, DC USA",Northeastern University; IE University,"Bhargava, R (corresponding author), Northeastern Univ, Sch Journalism, Boston, MA USA.",r.bhargava@northeastern.edu,,,,,,,40,0,0,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1751-2786,1751-2794,,JOURNAL PRACT,Journal.

In all, it finds support for a difficulty effect; people had lower content and source perceptions when they were shown a headline with unfamiliar acronym(s) compared with ones they knew, and they were more frustrated with those articles. These differences were moderated by need for cognition. In terms of a presence effect, people did perceive some differences in articles with acronyms in their headlines compared to those without, particularly if they were paying close attention, but those differences were much less pronounced. In other words, readers don't seem to be inherently bothered by the presence of acronyms in headlines; they seem to be bothered by the ones they don't understand.

Thus, headline formats appear to play a significant role in audience's perceptions of online news stories, and science news professionals ought to consider the effects different formats have on readers.","[Janet, Kristina; Richards, Othello; Landrum, Asheley R.] Texas Tech Univ, Coll Media & Commun, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA",Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University,"Landrum, AR (corresponding author), Texas Tech Univ, Coll Media & Commun, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA.",A.Landrum@ttu.edu,"Landrum, Asheley/AAY-3394-2020","Landrum, Asheley/0000-0002-3074-804X; Janet, Kristina/0000-0002-4529-0430; Richards, Othello/0000-0001-8202-8610",National Science Foundation [DRL181099],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This work was supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant DRL181099 awarded to S.

Her resignation ignited robust debates about professional norms and journalistic accountability among journalists, partisan elites, and the public. Drawing on insights from ethical crisis communication, journalistic paradigm repair, and schema congruity theory, this study used this case as a point of departure and examined the effects of NYT response to and politician endorsement of Weiss's resignation on news audiences' perceptions and subsequent behaviors. Based on a 3 (NYT response: acceptance, denial, silence) by 2 (partisan endorsement: left-leaning vs right-leaning) between-subject experiment (N = 251) in the United States, we found that NYT's accepting response induced higher ratings of journalistic accountability of NYT, which in turn led to greater intentions to engage with the outlet. Endorsement from the right-leaning partisan elites resulted in lower perceptions of Weiss's ethics, but higher levels of news engagement. Further, there was an indirect effect of partisan endorsement on news engagement intentions through perceived ethics. We discussed our findings regarding how news organizations could uphold their core values and meet their business goals during reputational crises at times of low media trust and heightened political polarization.","[Zeng, Cheng; Lu, Shuning] North Dakota State Univ, Dept Commun, Fargo, ND 58105 USA",North Dakota State University Fargo,"Zeng, C (corresponding author), North Dakota State Univ, Dept Commun, Fargo, ND 58105 USA.",cheng.zeng@ndsu.edu,,"Zeng, Cheng/0000-0002-5032-3137",,,,,45,0,0,3,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1751-2786,1751-2794,,JOURNAL PRACT,Journal.

For example, journalists can identify the number of COVID-19 cases by neighborhood, map those, and then share hot spots with their audiences. They can break down political allegiances, block by block, and predict elections. They can tag location data on reported events and filter those to provide a neighborhood-specific newsletter, and so on. But how is this location data acquired and attended to? This study examines how location data is being used by journalists and the ethical concerns that can arise with such data. Recent location data breaches with third-party technology companies have raised questions about how this kind of data is collected, stored, maintained, and shared on a wider scale. This study used the Delphi method of progressive interviews with a panel of subject matter experts and consisted of three rounds of discussions with U.S. journalists and journalism ethicists. The findings identify several themes of how location data poses new storytelling opportunities and significant ethical issues related to privacy, transparency, and validity. Implications for future uses of location data in journalism are discussed, including placing such data into contexts both in the profession and in the academy.","[Weiss, Amy Schmitz] San Diego State Univ, Sch Journalism & Media Studies, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Oppegaard, Brett] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Sch Commun, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",California State University System; San Diego State University; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa,"Weiss, AS (corresponding author), San Diego State Univ, Sch Journalism & Media Studies, San Diego, CA 92182 USA.",aschmitz@sdsu.edu,"Oppegaard, Brett/GVT-2800-2022; Oppegaard, Brett/J-1653-2015","Oppegaard, Brett/0000-0002-5778-1464",Carol Burnett Award from the University of Hawaii at Manoa [UHF 120-7131-2],Carol Burnett Award from the University of Hawaii at Manoa,The work was supported by Carol Burnett Award from the University of Hawaii at Manoa [Grant Number UHF 120-7131-2].,,59,0,0,3,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1751-2786,1751-2794,,JOURNAL PRACT,Journal.

This study analyzes, from a safety in practice perspective, the physical and digital threats that challenge the work of Syrian citizen journalists examining the role of three online advocacy networks created by Syrian diaspora journalists to promote newsafety. Through a metajournalistic discourse analysis of the networks' published visions and missions, and 12 in-depth interviews with the founders and other selected members of the networks, the paper investigates how journalists working for these networks perceive threats, what counterstrategies they adopt, and how they understand the changing nature of their roles. Findings demonstrate that diaspora journalists perceived physical and digital threats as inescapable, following them across borders. Counterstrategies are implemented through collaborations with civil society actors and human rights organizations, aiming to offer professional safety training programs and emergency rescue for journalists under attack, but also through the release of safety guides or codes of conduct. Grounded on the findings, we propose four novel journalistic roles for promoting newsafety from exile: sousveillance, defender, trainer, and regulator/policy developer. While the networks follow some traditional journalistic ideologies, they also show a hybrid conceptualization of journalism.","[Porlezza, Colin; Arafat, Rana] Univ Svizzera Italiana, Inst Media & Journalism, Fac Commun Culture & Soc, Lugano, Switzerland",Universita della Svizzera Italiana,"Porlezza, C (corresponding author), Univ Svizzera Italiana, Inst Media & Journalism, Fac Commun Culture & Soc, Lugano, Switzerland.",colin.porlezza@usi.ch,,"Porlezza, Colin/0000-0002-1400-5879; Arafat, Rana/0000-0002-6778-0107",,,,,64,2,2,2,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1751-2786,1751-2794,,JOURNAL PRACT,Journal.

As these programs emerge, it is important to ask questions about their effectiveness and impact.

The designation, reduction, and redesignation of the monument, designed to protect Indigenous archaeological sites, catalyzed debate covered by local news. Protected areas in the United States face increasing threat from resource development, which can accelerate climate change. Using the frame matrix method to qualitatively analyze language in local news articles, this study increases understanding of political and cultural meanings associated with the monument. Frames of failure, validation, and authoritarianism defined designation; frames of loss, remediation, and resistance defined reduction; and a stability frame defined redesignation. Results highlight how symbolic devices (e.g., metaphors, catchphrases) used by opponents to reject the monument's designation were then used by supporters to reject its reduction. This study gives insight into how local news reporting of conflict over public land protections can prioritize Settler over Indigenous metaphysics. By emphasizing subjugation of land to human control rather than interconnectedness between humans and nature, local news not only shapes perception of a protected area's significance but may also impede climate change mitigation.","[Macary, Jared T.] Univ Oregon, Sch Journalism & Commun, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Gillig, Traci K.] Washington State Univ, Edward R Murrow Coll Commun, Pullman, WA 99164 USA",University of Oregon; Washington State University,"Macary, JT (corresponding author), Univ Oregon, Sch Journalism & Commun, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.",jmacary@uoregon.edu,,,,,,,64,0,0,3,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1751-2786,1751-2794,,JOURNAL PRACT,Journal.

Specifically, it examines how the newspapers vary in their use of positive and negative frames, sources, and tone towards the YV protests during a six-month period. Analyses of frames reveal that the most prevalent across all newspapers was the legitimising frame (positive), and the least used was the delegitimising frame (negative). Additionally, Le Monde and Le Figaro shared slightly similar results of negatively framing the events in just more than half of their coverage despite their distinct political leanings. Several differences were also found between L'Humanite and the remaining publications; while official sources were the most used sources by Le Monde, La Croix, and Le Figaro, L'Humanite relied mostly on YV sources and presented the most overwhelmingly positive tone toward the YV movement. These results lend support to some perceived public concerns over the critical portrayal of the YV protests and overreliance on official narratives in the French press but show that significant disparities remain in the news coverage among newspapers with different ideological orientations.","[Jebril, Nael; El Bouzidi, Mohammed] Doha Inst Grad Studies, Doha, Qatar; [Jebril, Nael] Bournemouth Univ, Commun & Journalism Dept, Bournemouth, Dorset, England",Bournemouth University,"Jebril, N (corresponding author), Doha Inst Grad Studies, Doha, Qatar.;Jebril, N (corresponding author), Bournemouth Univ, Commun & Journalism Dept, Bournemouth, Dorset, England.",nael.jebril@dohainstitute.edu.qa,,,,,,,64,0,0,2,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1751-2786,1751-2794,,JOURNAL PRACT,Journal.

However, research regarding the influence of the Internet and digitalization on evolving newsrooms and journalistic practice in the global South is limited. Particularly, the case of Pakistan is unique in the global South because the country ranks at the last quartile of the Inclusive Internet Index (i.e., 90 out of 120). While Pakistan's mainstream news media organizations have well-connected newsrooms in terms of the Internet access, there is a research lacuna in terms of digital skills of journalists to use the Internet and other digital tools. Therefore, drawing on the theory of digital divide, this study explores journalists' access to the Internet and their digital skills to use the Internet and digital tools. This study also investigates how digital incompetency of journalists impacts their routine work and the evolution of digital newsrooms in the mainstream Pakistani news media. To accomplish these aims, this study uses the qualitative method of in-depth interviews (face-to-face) and present findings using inductive thematic analysis.","[Jamil, Sadia] Khalifa Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Humanities & Social Sci, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates",Khalifa University of Science & Technology,"Jamil, S (corresponding author), Khalifa Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Humanities & Social Sci, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates.",Sadia.jamil@ymail.com,,"Jamil, Sadia/0000-0003-0524-7355",,,,,57,1,1,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1751-2786,1751-2794,,JOURNAL PRACT,Journal.

Building on a prior study of online news media coverage of the heatwaves, this study surveyed journalists from major news outlets in France, Germany, the Netherlands and the UK. Based on the responses of 42 journalists, we found a relative lack of knowledge about EEA studies but a high level of importance assigned to writing about the link between the heatwaves and climate change (e.g., likelihood or intensity); a relatively low number of specialist reporters vs. general reporters covering the heatwaves; a strong reliance on scientific experts as sources; no inclusion of climate change deniers; stronger role perceptions as educators than advocates; relatively little time and resource constraints on their reporting; and an overall tendency for the journalists to report more about climate change. The findings provide new insights into journalism practice and climate journalism in terms of the peculiarities and contextual factors that can influence coverage of extreme weather events and climate change.","[Strauss, Nadine] Univ Zurich, Dept Commun & Media Res, Zurich, Switzerland; [Painter, James] Univ Oxford, Reuters Inst Study Journalism, Dept Polit & Int Relat, Oxford, England; [Painter, James; Ettinger, Joshua; Walton, Peter] Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, Oxford, England; [Doutreix, Marie-Noelle] Univ Lyon 2, ICOM, Lyon, France; [Wonneberger, Anke] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Commun Res, Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Zurich; University of Oxford; University of Oxford; Universite Lyon 2; University of Amsterdam,"Strauss, N (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Dept Commun & Media Res, Zurich, Switzerland.",n.strauss@ikmz.uzh.ch,"Strauss, Nadine/GRJ-4938-2022","Strauss, Nadine/0000-0002-5050-7067; Ettinger, Joshua/0000-0002-6053-6048",Royal Bank of Canada [ENV20197234],Royal Bank of Canada,This work was supported by Royal Bank of Canada [grant number ENV20197234].,,84,2,2,3,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1751-2786,1751-2794,,JOURNAL PRACT,Journal.

The goal of the study is to highlight principles of algorithmic process in AJ and the processes these principles are perceived, appreciated and acted upon by AJ users. The idea of algorithmic trust is proposed as a new form of digital affordance in algorithm-driven news services. It identifies key issues of AJ and conceptualizes such issues in reference to algorithmic trust by analyzing how they influence reader satisfaction and adoption of AJ. A multi-mixed mixed method integrating interpretive methods and empirical survey was used for Korean users. Algorithmic affordances offer a useful standpoint on the conceptualization of algorithmic trust. Cognitive processes and heuristic mechanisms provide better foundations for algorithm design and development and a stronger basis for design of sensemaking AJ.

The original tweets labeled #cop25 and published by media, individual journalists, and other users such as NGOs and international organizations among others, were downloaded during the summit. Through a content analysis they were classified according to the type of author, the format, the type of content, and the transmitted sentiment. After calculating their engagement, significant differences were identified using non-parametric statistical tests. The results show that the tweets that generated the most engagement are those published by journalists, those that contain only text, and those that present a negative sentiment. One of the most relevant findings is that journalists can be key pieces in the communication and awareness of climate change if they are more active on Twitter. If, however, they maintain a much lower number of posts than other users, it becomes paradoxical in that those who achieve a more effective impact are not sufficiently exploiting the potential of Twitter.","[Carrasco Polaino, Rafael] Univ Complutense Madrid, Journalism & New Media, Madrid, Spain; [Mera Fernandez, Montse; Parratt Fernandez, Sonia] Univ Complutense Madrid, Journalism & Global Commun, Madrid, Spain",Complutense University of Madrid; Complutense University of Madrid,"Polaino, RC (corresponding author), Univ Complutense Madrid, Journalism & New Media, Madrid, Spain.",racarras@ucm.es,"CARRASCO POLAINO, RAFAEL/I-6962-2017; Mera Fernandez, Montse/C-9678-2017","CARRASCO POLAINO, RAFAEL/0000-0002-0687-6842; Mera Fernandez, Montse/0000-0003-4702-9786",Banco Santander; Universidad Complutense de Madrid [PR108/20-21],Banco Santander; Universidad Complutense de Madrid,This work was supported by Banco Santander; Universidad Complutense de Madrid [grant number PR108/20-21].,,81,0,0,3,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1751-2786,1751-2794,,JOURNAL PRACT,Journal.

This research examines the question of why newsrooms provide a context conducive to persistent unethical workplace behaviors. We conducted 25 indepth interviews with reporters, editors, anchors, producers, and news executives. Sexual harassment has been in the public eye, but our informants also described other unethical workplace behaviors such as bullying, discrimination, and incivility. Behavioral ethics emerged as a theoretical lens to help interpret our data. Five explanatory themes arose: 1) conceiving of work solely as creating journalistic content; 2) toxic rituals, rites of passage, and norms; 3) high power differentials and acquiescent behavior; 4) ineffective organizational mechanisms; and 5) a disruptive industry context. Networks of complicity enabled the bad behavior, and together with the themes, created a perfect storm that permitted unethical behavior to persist. Two paradoxes resulted: 1) the ethics paradox in which journalists had high ethical sensitivity in reporting but were blind to unethical behavior within newsrooms and 2) the power paradox in which journalists experienced role conflict caused by the need for initiative, courage, independence, and resistance to intimidation in reporting versus the dependence, obedience, and acquiescence required within newsrooms.","[Drumwright, Minette E.] Univ Texas Austin, Moody Coll Commun, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Cunningham, Peggy H.] Dalhousie Univ, Rowe Sch Business, Halifax, NS, Canada",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; Dalhousie University,"Drumwright, ME (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, Moody Coll Commun, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",mdrum@mail.utexas.edu,,"Cunningham, Peggy/0000-0002-2160-5944",,,,,65,1,1,1,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1751-2786,1751-2794,,JOURNAL PRACT,Journal.

The main predictors of use of these aggressive practices were a journalist's role orientation, or goal in journalism, being influenced by journalism ethical norms and social influences, and to a lesser extent gender, attitude, and organisational factors such as working on a daily newspaper. The profile of a journalist who would use these practices is one with a clear belief in their journalism goal who is more influenced by journalism ethical norms and friends and family than media regulation, authority figures or organisational pressures such as editorial policy.

Qualitative analysis of 30 interviews with journalists who covered hurricane Harvey revealed journalists actively engaged in emotional labor during their coverage. Furthermore, their choices for emotional display were based on a shared understanding of professional guidelines and expectations mandating emotional distance in order to maintain objectivity.

Like any persuasive communication, fact checkers depend on their recipients perceiving both their messages and them as credible (Lombardi, Seyranian, and Sinatra 2014; Lombardi, Nussbaum, and Sinatra 2016). This study investigates the role of the perceived credibility of the fact checker as possible detriment to the effectiveness of fact-checking efforts by means of an online survey-embedded experiment. Results show that the perceived credibility of the fact checker and fact-checking messages is best explained by normative expectations of the roles of fact checkers and trust in traditional media. Some users perceive fact checkers as elite power structures in journalism or, in other words, as collaborative-facilitators for state propaganda (Hanitzsch and Vos 2018; see also Fawzi 2020). Further, low trust in media and politics predicts perceived credibility of disinformation better than political partisanship. The findings suggest that fact checkers should be more transparent and proactive in communicating their motives and identities.

In this context, we explore whether the inverted pyramid model - a system of news writing that arranges facts in descending order of importance, which remains predominant in journalism - is the most effective way of communicating information online. Based on a mixed-methods approach using qualitative data from workshops and expert consultations, we developed a series of new prototypes of online news storytelling and tested them with a wide range of audiences (N = 1268). Building on earlier work, we find that linear forms of storytelling - rarely used in news - are more effective in transferring knowledge to news consumers and are seen as more engaging, convenient and useful than the traditional inverted pyramid.

In this regard, various initiatives, especially in Ibero-America, have opted for slow journalism as a reaction and response to information devaluation. The commitment to journalism that appreciates context and cares for narrative has driven this slow news trend that believes in author journalism and stories' humanization. Through the methodology of the case study, of a qualitative and exploratory nature, 12 experiences of slow journalism media in Ibero-America are reviewed, with a particular interest in their themes, contents, aesthetics, and sources of financing. It is concluded that these media are one of the few that carry out investigative journalism, although to subsist, they depend to a great extent on international cooperation agencies since their contents and aesthetics are elitist in comparison with their conventional digital peers, which reduces their capacity of maintenance by subscriptions and advertising.","[Romero-Rodriguez, Luis M.; Castillo-Abdul, Barbara] Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Dept Commun Sci & Sociol, Madrid, Spain; [Romero-Rodriguez, Luis M.] Espiritu Santo Univ, BESAI Business Sch, Guayaquil, Ecuador; [Tejedor, Santiago] Autonomous Univ BarcelonaSpain, Dept Journalism & Commun Sci, Barcelona, Spain",Universidad Rey Juan Carlos; Universidad de Especialidades Espiritu Santo,"Romero-Rodriguez, LM (corresponding author), Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Dept Commun Sci & Sociol, Madrid, Spain.;Romero-Rodriguez, LM (corresponding author), Espiritu Santo Univ, BESAI Business Sch, Guayaquil, Ecuador.",luis.romero@urjc.es,"Castillo-Abdul, BÃ¡rbara/AAY-4187-2020; Romero-Rodriguez, Luis M./P-8698-2014","Castillo-Abdul, BÃ¡rbara/0000-0002-3711-1519; Romero-Rodriguez, Luis M./0000-0003-3924-1517; Tejedor, Santiago/0000-0002-5539-9800","R+D Project YOUTUBERS AND INSTAGRAMMERS: MEDIA COMPETENCE IN EMERGING PROSUMERS - State Research Agency of the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities [RTI2018-093303-B-I00]; European Regional Development Fund (ERDF); Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion","R+D Project YOUTUBERS AND INSTAGRAMMERS: MEDIA COMPETENCE IN EMERGING PROSUMERS - State Research Agency of the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities; European Regional Development Fund (ERDF)(European Commission); Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion(Ministry of Science and Innovation, Spain (MICINN)Instituto de Salud Carlos IIISpanish Government)","This work is conducted within the framework of Alfamed (Euro-American Network of Researchers), with the support of the R+D Project YOUTUBERS AND INSTAGRAMMERS: MEDIA COMPETENCE IN EMERGING PROSUMERS(RTI2018-093303-B-I00), financed by the State Research Agency of the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities and the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).

Etiology analysis shows that Chinese fake news is mainly about social life partially because of no previous tradition of verifying daily statements from politicians. Trend predictions reveal that online media, hearsay, and social life-related news of unverified single sources are the main problems which are different from the West and require special attention in the future.

In particular, the current research examines and quantifies the origin of the news stories included in the media agenda to observe its degree of dependence on external sources. In this regard, the study observes the front pages of three major Spanish newspapers - El Pais, ABC and El Mundo - over three years: 1998, 2008, and 2018. The findings reveal that the economic recession and the increasingly digital environment due to the spread of the Internet had a perverse effect on the construction of the media agenda. The volume of internally originated contents of public interest decreased, while there was an increase in contents emanating from diverse external sources - especially political and governmental - that attend to their own particular interests. This rising external dependence, which may be extrapolated to other countries or media (digital, television and radio), leads to media's loss of control of their own agenda, favours the prevalence of desktop or passive journalism, and finally affects the necessary surveillance of power by the media.","[Serrano, Itziar Bernaola] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Commun Dept, Getafe, Spain",Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,"Serrano, IB (corresponding author), Univ Carlos III Madrid, Commun Dept, Getafe, Spain.",ibernaol@hum.uc3m.es,,"Bernaola, Itziar/0000-0002-1607-2661",,,,,79,0,0,1,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1751-2786,1751-2794,,JOURNAL PRACT,Journal.

It becomes especially complicated in conflict situations; while journalists must depend on information flowing from media sources of the opposing side, these sources are often considered unreliable. This study examines how the media of each party in a conflict uses information published by the opposing side. Quantitative and qualitative textual analysis of 600 articles published by Israeli and Palestinian news outlets between the years 2006 and 2015 demonstrates that the powerful side in the conflict (Israel) tends to be more skeptical about information published by the weaker side (the Palestinians) than vice versa. Expressions of suspicion are especially pronounced in the context of cooperation between the two sides. The study maps the discursive practices used by journalists to express reservations about the content published by the media of the opposing side, the actors quoted, and the media outlets themselves. While previous studies have highlighted the potential of using information from media sources of the opposing side in providing alternative perspectives for domestic audiences, the findings of this study demonstrate that the use of reservations in news discourse casts doubt on the reliability of such perspectives.","[Gonen, Yonatan; Kampf, Zohar; Tenenboim-Weinblatt, Keren] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Commun & Journalism, Jerusalem, Israel",Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"Gonen, Y (corresponding author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Commun & Journalism, Jerusalem, Israel.",yonatan.gonen@mail.huji.ac.il,,"Tenenboim-Weinblatt, Keren/0000-0001-9268-3969; Kampf, Zohar/0000-0003-3563-1403",European Union [613308],European Union(European Commission),"This work was supported by the European Union's 7th Framework Program for Research, Technological Development & Demonstration, Grant No. 613308 (INFOCORE).",,65,1,1,0,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1751-2786,1751-2794,,JOURNAL PRACT,Journal.

In addition, this study explores what roles career generation gaps play in the relationship between traditionally gendered factors, the new media environment, and women journalists' intention to leave. By analyzing data from a survey of members of the Korean Women Journalists Association, the most authoritative and representative organization of women journalists in South Korea, findings of this study showed that not only traditionally gendered factors but also emerging factors were positively associated with the resignations of Korean women journalists. In this study, traditionally gendered factors include a masculine-dominant newsroom culture, discriminations in beat assignments and promotions, and work-family conflicts. Emerging factors related to the new media environment include cyberbullying, additional online workloads, and the weakening of women journalists' social status. The results indicate that emerging factors were more positively associated with women journalists' intention to resign. In addition, the relationship between work-family conflict and intention to leave differed depending on the individual journalist's career generation.","[Lee, Na Yeon] Yonsei Univ, Dept Commun, Seoul, South Korea; [Kim, Changsook] Ewha Womans Univ, Ewha Commun Media Res Ctr, Seoul, South Korea",Yonsei University; Ewha Womans University,"Lee, NY (corresponding author), Yonsei Univ, Dept Commun, Seoul, South Korea.",larosa@yonsei.ac.kr,,,Yonsei University,Yonsei University,This work was supported by the Yonsei University Research Grant of 2022.,,68,0,0,2,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1751-2786,1751-2794,,JOURNAL PRACT,Journal.

However, it is largely unclear how news media for children/adolescents report on migration and refugees, and in which way this reporting differs from reporting of news media produced for adults. Thus, a standardized analysis was conducted of (audio)visual content published in 2018 by nearly 40 German journalistic outlets. News media for children/adolescents (N = 434) and adults (N = 2,626) were analyzed regarding the regional focus of reporting, frame elements, evaluation of immigration, and verbal contributions and characteristics of the refugees reported on. Results show that, on the one hand, the reporting of news media for children/adolescents and adults was similar in many ways. On the other hand, news media for children/adolescents reported to some extent in a more balanced, diverse and reflective manner than those for adults. Thus, the reporting of news media for children/adolescents seems to be better suited for triggering in-depth opinion-formation processes among young people. Moreover, it might contribute better to the integration of (underaged) refugees.","[Dohle, Marco; Bormann, Marike; Vowe, Gerhard] Heinrich Heine Univ Duesseldorf, Dept Commun & Media Studies, Dusseldorf, Germany; [Kelm, Ole] Heinrich Heine Univ Duesseldorf, Inst Social Sci, Dusseldorf, Germany",Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf; Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf,"Dohle, M (corresponding author), Heinrich Heine Univ Duesseldorf, Dept Commun & Media Studies, Dusseldorf, Germany.",marco.dohle@hhu.de,"Kelm, Ole/ABG-7450-2020","Kelm, Ole/0000-0002-5500-9657; Vowe, Gerhard/0000-0002-9440-6460",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research [01UG1733AX/-BX],German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),This work was supported by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research under Grant number 01UG1733AX/-BX,,51,0,0,1,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1751-2786,1751-2794,,JOURNAL PRACT,Journal.

Among authoritarian countries, Russia and China have invested particularly heavily in international news, through outlets like RT and CGTN. However, few comparative studies have examined the differences between authoritarian states' use of international news for geopolitical purposes. This article conducts a comparative, mixed-method, multi-platform content analysis of RT and CGTN's 2020 US election coverage. Based on multiple differences between the outlets' content, it argues that they adopt two distinct international propaganda models. RT operates a partisan parasite model, imitating a partisan outlet in the US' media ecology, while CGTN employs a surface neutrality model, which cloaks pro-China propaganda with a superficial impression of impartiality. Explicating these models using original empirical evidence, the paper advances theory on the evolving use of international news media as a geopolitical tool.","[Moore, Martin] Kings Coll London, Dept Polit Econ, London, England; [Colley, Thomas] Royal Mil Acad Sandhurst, Sandhurst, England",University of London; King's College London,"Moore, M (corresponding author), Kings Coll London, Dept Polit Econ, London, England.",martin.moore@kcl.ac.uk,,"Colley, Thomas Paul/0000-0002-7649-2131",,,,,58,0,0,14,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1751-2786,1751-2794,,JOURNAL PRACT,Journal.

This study examines the roles of editors and users in post-publication gatekeeping by conducting cross-lagged analysis of news ranking on Chinese digital native media. The sample comprised of 2412 unique news items from Pear Video. Our findings reaffirm that between editors and users there is a disparity of interest while ranking public and non-public affairs. Differing from prior studies, this study observes that editors rank news items of non-public affairs higher while users rank items of public affairs higher. More importantly, this study discloses that editors and users practice different gatekeeping mechanisms under differential UGC news topics. They tend to agree with each other on the news ranking of non-public affairs while run in opposite directions on the news ranking of public affairs. The reasons for and implications of postpublication gatekeeping theory are also discussed.","[Ai, Minwei; Gibrilu, Abdul Wahab] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Sch Journalism & Commun, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Nan] Xiamen Univ, Sch Journalism & Commun, Xiamen, Peoples R China",Chinese University of Hong Kong; Xiamen University,"Zhang, N (corresponding author), Xiamen Univ, Sch Journalism & Commun, Xiamen, Peoples R China.",nanzhang@xmu.edu.cn,,"Gibrilu, Abdul Wahab/0000-0001-6067-5278",Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China [2072021113]; Social Science Foundation of Fujian Province [FJ2021C062],Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Social Science Foundation of Fujian Province,"This work was supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China [grant number 2072021113], Social Science Foundation of Fujian Province [grant number FJ2021C062].",,76,0,0,4,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1751-2786,1751-2794,,JOURNAL PRACT,Journal.

This paper examined Guardian Online and Positive News to identify examples of good practice in reporting the synergistic effects of climate change and COVID-19, as both are committed to covering climate change and practice solutions-oriented constructive journalism that provides context by explaining relations between issues. The study sought to identify the types of synergistic effects that were reported and how they were reported through metaphors-key conceptualisation tools. Analysis of 153 news articles published in the first year of the pandemic showed that the coverage of synergistic effects was solutions-oriented and synergistic effects were discussed mainly through Movement and Colour metaphors-particularly the colour Green. War metaphors which have dominated reporting when climate change and COVID-19 have been discussed separately were rare. Reliance on Movement and Colour metaphors can be interpreted as a positive practice, as Movement metaphors are familiar, vivid and more flexible than War metaphors, while Green metaphors are closely associated with environmentalism and have positive connotations.","[Atanasova, Dimitrinka] Univ Lancaster, Dept Linguist & English Language, Lancaster, England",Lancaster University,"Atanasova, D (corresponding author), Univ Lancaster, Dept Linguist & English Language, Lancaster, England.",d.atanasova@lancaster.ac.uk,,"Atanasova, Dimitrinka/0000-0003-3474-8909",,,,,106,0,0,10,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1751-2786,1751-2794,,JOURNAL PRACT,Journal.

It thereby explores the (new) skills future journalists need to acquire within their education in order to become proficient in multimedia work routines. Following the team-based learning approach (TBL), 41 early-career journalists produced multimedia stories in higher education practical training in a simulated low-budget editorial office. By conducting a quantitative survey among all participants and a qualitative content analysis of one guided interview per team (n = 7), results show that working according to individual skills, maintaining a strong group accountability and staying flexible were important success factors under these circumstances. The largest obstacles were the conceptualization of complex projects under timed conditions as well as the disproportionately high communication efforts.

Most existing studies on journalists' adoption of and media's discourse around data-driven journalism have focused on Western contexts. The present study focuses on Hong Kong, a non-Western society where data-driven journalism is nascent. This study applies the diffusion of innovation theory, the technology acceptance model, and the trading zone framework to explain how journalists adopt data-driven journalism and how this journalistic practice is communicated to the public through media coverage. An online survey was conducted with news professionals in local media organizations (n = 255), as was a supplementary content analysis of news articles on data-driven journalism published in Hong Kong media in 2009-2019 (n = 57). Survey results revealed that perceived ease of use and perceived popularity were positively associated with the adoption of data-driven journalism. The more designers were involved in the news production process, the more likely it was for participants to adopt data-driven journalism. Additionally, most media coverage highlighted the positive outcomes of data-driven journalism-particularly its observability and usefulness-as well as the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration. The implications of applying data science to news production and the sociotechnical context of Hong Kong are discussed.","[Zhang, Xinzhi] Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Dept Journalism, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Chen, Minyi] Nanyang Technol Univ, Wee Kim Wee Sch Commun & Informat, Singapore, Singapore",Hong Kong Baptist University; Nanyang Technological University & National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore; Nanyang Technological University,"Zhang, XZ (corresponding author), Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Dept Journalism, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",xzzhang2@gmail.com,"Zhang, Xinzhi/S-9610-2019","Zhang, Xinzhi/0000-0003-3479-9327; Chen, Minyi/0000-0002-5270-5761",Hong Kong Baptist University [FRG1/17-18/048],Hong Kong Baptist University,This project was funded by the Faculty Research Grant (FRG1/17-18/048) of Hong Kong Baptist University.,,43,0,0,4,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1751-2786,1751-2794,,JOURNAL PRACT,Journal.

Drawing on the literature of crisis innovation, this study aims to understand the transformations that have taken place in the Spanish journalistic industry and the innovations implemented during the pandemic. The research questions are: How has COVID-19 fostered innovation in work organisation in the Spanish newsrooms? What other innovations were launched by the Spanish media during the pandemic? The methodology is based on semi-structured interviews conducted with a purposive sample of 20 media practitioners and 20 experts on journalism innovation (academics and journalists) in Spain. Results show that newsroom practices have evolved through telework, collaboration and other factors, and that digital transformation was accelerated in legacy media. In many outlets, the science section was increasingly relevant, working in a coordinated way with the areas of data visualisation and design to produce relevant content. Also, fact-checkers played an important role in fighting misinformation. The pandemic has speeded up some ongoing innovations in news production, newsroom organisation, distribution, and commercialisation in a significant way. Thus, COVID-19 understood as a crisis situation has had an impact on news products and it has affected journalistic culture.","[Garcia-Aviles, Jose A.; Arias-Robles, Felix; de Lara-Gonzalez, Alicia; Carvajal, Miguel; Maria Valero-Pastor, Jose; Mondejar, Damaso] Miguel Hernandez Univ, Elche, Spain",Universidad Miguel Hernandez de Elche,"Garcia-Aviles, JA (corresponding author), Miguel Hernandez Univ, Elche, Spain.",jose.garciaa@umh.es,,,"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) [438677067]","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation)(German Research Foundation (DFG))","This paper forms part of the research project Journalism innovation in democratic societies: Index, impact, and prerequisites in international comparison (JoIn-DemoS), funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation), Project-ID 438677067. https://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/projekt/438677067",,69,0,0,1,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1751-2786,1751-2794,,JOURNAL PRACT,Journal.

Studies on former Eastern bloc countries have become few and far between recently so this research aims to fill this gap by examining how the coronavirus pandemic and associated restrictions have impacted journalism practice in Bulgaria and how journalists, and independent media organisations responded and adapted to the pressures in 2020. Our findings from semi structured interviews with media practitioners show that it is the independent media that has borne the brunt of the crisis.

Relevant studies have focused on its emergence as a movement within journalism aiming at renewing the profession, as well as its effectiveness in challenging disinformation, especially during elections. However, little has been said about how audiences themselves understand fact-checking and employ it in their daily consumption of news. In this article, we answer these questions by drawing upon two sets of data. The first consists of fourteen focus group discussions in the UK, which included 52 participants, and were conducted online between April and May 2021. The second consists of two qualitative surveys that explored news consumers' understandings of fact-checking and their evaluations of current fact-checking practices of UK media during the same period. We conclude that the use of fact-checking remains largely peripheral, and its influence is minimal in people's news consumption. However, there is an appetite for more fact-checking in television news, as a way of holding politicians into account and helping the public better understand politics. In this context, we argue, if fact-checking is to play an important role in political discourse, it should become a regular part of broadcast journalism.","[Kyriakidou, Maria; Cushion, Stephen; Hughes, Ceri; Morani, Marina] Cardiff Univ, Sch Journalism Media & Culture, Cardiff, Wales",Cardiff University,"Kyriakidou, M (corresponding author), Cardiff Univ, Sch Journalism Media & Culture, Cardiff, Wales.",kyriakidoum@cardiff.ac.uk,,"Hughes, Ceri/0000-0002-9538-6377",Arts and Humanities Research Council [AH/S012508/1],Arts and Humanities Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC)),This work was supported by Arts and Humanities Research Council [Grant Number AH/S012508/1].,,30,0,0,1,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1751-2786,1751-2794,,JOURNAL PRACT,Journal.

Using content analysis as a method, this paper operationalized Galtung's classification of peace journalism and follows framing methodological adjustments and improvements suggested by previous peace journalism scholars. Results show that, even during peace talks, media use war narratives more often than peace frames, and social media users amplify more war than peace-oriented content. Proximity to conflict also was shown to be an important factor, as Colombian media used more war frames than foreign media. These findings are relevant for their implications about how national media consistently emphasized a war frame that social media users amplified, which we argue has implications for how citizens viewed the Colombian peace process, ultimately potentially influencing the decision to vote down the referendum.","[Garcia-Perdomo, Victor] Univ La Sabana, Sch Commun, Bogota, Colombia; [Harlow, Summer] Univ Houston, Jack J Valenti Sch Commun, Houston, TX USA; [Brown, Danielle K.] Univ Minnesota, Hubbard Sch Journalism & Mass Commun, Minneapolis, MN USA",Universidad de La Sabana; University of Houston System; University of Houston; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Garcia-Perdomo, V (corresponding author), Univ La Sabana, Sch Commun, Bogota, Colombia.",victor.garcia2@unisabana.edu.co,"; Garcia-Perdomo, Victor/C-2175-2017","Harlow, Summer/0000-0001-6079-1439; Brown, Danielle/0000-0001-7637-8964; Garcia-Perdomo, Victor/0000-0002-7187-1618",,,,,94,1,1,3,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1751-2786,1751-2794,,JOURNAL PRACT,Journal.

Our study shows once more that when newsrooms are confronted with changing circumstances, in this case, due to a merger, contemplation about how to address these changes happens largely behind closed doors on the management level, in the meantime leading to frustration amongst employees fearing that their professional identities and practices will be absolved in the newly to be created company structure. Involuntarily, our field study was affected by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, which we turned into an opportunity to explore the methodological consequences for ethnographic observations that in the future are bound to be taking place in increasingly hybrid newsrooms and other work settings.

It interviewed 17 of their newsworkers, 15 of which described the way their newspaper makes news as digital first without being prompted. The full range of properties attributed to digital first emerging from the data reflected five dimensions: temporality, content format, workflow, production mindset and business strategy. These five dimensions were conceptualized by building a digital first matrix, thereby contributing to definitional clarity, while also serving as a useful tool to analyze newspaper production.

Fact-checkers promote rationality and assist citizens in making informed decisions. However, fact-checkers' motives, methods and abilities are doubted and subjected to distrust. Lack of perceived trust is a major concern in the profession of fact-checking journalism. To build public trust, fact-checking organisations have been advised to be transparent about news production processes. Besides the trust mechanism, compliance to transparency is an important tenet of journalistic professionalism. This study seeks to analyse Indian fact-checkers' explanations of their methodology for factchecking claims and commitments to ensuring methodological transparency. Qualitative content analysis of declarations published by seven Indian fact-checkers on their websites demonstrates that fact-checking is conducted in a systemic and transparent manner. Transparency norm seems to have emerged as a governing principle in the context of fact-checking journalism. The findings of this study have been interpreted in the view of literature on journalistic transparency.","[Kumar, Anoop] Cent Univ Rajasthan, Sch Social Sci, Dept Culture & Media Studies, Ajmer, India",Central University of Rajasthan (CURAJ),"Kumar, A (corresponding author), Cent Univ Rajasthan, Sch Social Sci, Dept Culture & Media Studies, Ajmer, India.",anoop.kumar@curaj.ac.in,,,,,,,38,0,0,7,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1751-2786,1751-2794,,JOURNAL PRACT,Journal.

The results of a two condition between-subjects experiment (N= 100) conducted on a community sample showed that news modality affected information seeking intentions, enjoyment of news story, and the feelings of spatial presence, but did not affect actual information seeking behavior and information recall. Exposure to 360 degrees journalism led to the increase in spatial presence, which led to a linear increase in enjoyment, ultimately resulting in greater intentions to seek further information. Participants with a higher need for cognitive closure enjoyed consuming news more when the story was presented as 360 degrees journalism than those with a lower need for cognitive closure. Results contribute to expanding the theories of information seeking and the role of affective responses and spatial presence on news consumption in journalism and communication scholarship.","[Pjesivac, Ivanka] Univ Georgia, Journalism, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Ahn, Sun Joo (Grace); Kim, Solyee] Univ Georgia, Advertising & Publ Relat, Athens, GA 30602 USA",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; University System of Georgia; University of Georgia,"Pjesivac, I (corresponding author), Univ Georgia, Journalism, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",ivanka@uga.edu,,,"Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication (AEJMC); University of Georgia, USA, Department of Journalism, Carolyn McKenzie and Don E.

Findings indicate that press freedom in democratic countries is severely challenged and in certain deeply worrying cases, it is steadily declining, whereas factors that influence this decline appear to be common in different, even contradictory, media systems.

This dispute has become more salient in an authoritarian context. Both networked authoritarianism and non-confrontational digital activism are concepts that have been used to capture the methods of political control or resistance by appropriating new media technologies under an authoritarian regime. This study responds to the dispute by investigating news media effects on hierarchical political trust to parse the mechanism of effective governance using national survey data (N = 3781) in China. We found that the effects of news consumption from various media sources on political trust in both central and local governments were mediated by perceived happiness and moderated by the authoritarian values of Chinese netizens. These findings remind us that the formation of political trust is a sophisticated socio-psychological process in which diachronic social and economic changes, as well as the persistent political culture need to be fully considered.","[Meng, Xiaoxiao; Li, Yungeng] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Media & Commun, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Shanghai Jiao Tong University,"Li, YG (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Media & Commun, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",li.yungeng@sjtu.edu.cn,"Li, Yogo/GZG-7188-2022","Meng, Xiaoxiao/0000-0003-2979-189X; LI, Yungeng/0000-0001-9789-8416",,,,,90,3,3,11,42,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1751-2786,1751-2794,,JOURNAL PRACT,Journal.

The results showed that although China Daily initially depicted COVID-19 as a bane, it has since portrayed it as a relative boon. Positive themes were identified, like prosociality, cooperation, pandemic recovery and informativeness, while themes of political tension emerged, like Occidentalism. The current study advances our understanding of COVID-19 news representations by harnessing mixed-methods research, which reduces subjective bias and offers a more complete picture.

Departing from the notion that investigative methods are fixed tools and tactics, the paper argues that methods also serve as relational skills and epistemic resources in the struggle for identity and recognition within the field of journalism. By conducting a qualitative textual analysis of 44 method reports submitted to the annual Norwegian investigative journalism award (SKUP) in 2018, both the transformative and normative aspects of the investigative epistemology are examined. The findings suggest that the investigative method can be conceptualized as a continuum of intertwining epistemic practices whose distribution and emphasis are context dependent. Within these contexts, some identity markers emerge as more contingent than others. The study contributes to two streams of scholarship by deploying the concept of boundary work within the field of journalism, and by reassessing the epistemology of investigative journalism as an object of ongoing negotiations.","[Bjerknes, Fredrik] Univ Bergen, Dept Informat Sci & Media Studies, Bergen, Norway",University of Bergen,"Bjerknes, F (corresponding author), Univ Bergen, Dept Informat Sci & Media Studies, Bergen, Norway.",fredrik.bjerknes@uib.no,,,,,,,91,1,1,2,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1751-2786,1751-2794,,JOURNAL PRACT,Journal.

Of the most common frames found in previous coverage of mass shootings (gun control, popular culture, school safety), only gun control was prominent following the shootings in Parkland. Newer frames (partisan divide, activism, mental health) instead followed gun control in popularity, likely because these were utilized by the activist Parkland survivors themselves. With a few important exceptions (e.g., community newspapers used community change, law responsibility, and family responsibility more; national used gun control, activism, and partisan divide more), local and community newspapers were similar in their use of frames. Perhaps most importantly, the findings indicate the survivors' activism seemed to disrupt the settling of news coverage into well-established frames for mass shootings. This suggests the ongoing conversation about mass shootings remains complicated and more dependent on shootings' specific circumstances than may have been previously assumed.","[Holody, Kyle J.] Coastal Carolina Univ, Dept Commun Media & Culture, Conway, SC 29528 USA; [Shaughnessy, Brittany] Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Commun, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA",Coastal Carolina University; Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University,"Holody, KJ (corresponding author), Coastal Carolina Univ, Dept Commun Media & Culture, Conway, SC 29528 USA.",kholody@coastal.edu,,"Shaughnessy, Brittany/0000-0002-1070-7785",,,,,104,1,1,2,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1751-2786,1751-2794,,JOURNAL PRACT,Journal.

Our study focuses on this potential disconnect between the international and the Taiwanese debate about disinformation. With automatic and manual content analysis, we evaluate what role academics and journalism play in the public discourse and what part of this debate reaches the largest audience.

Findings show that both Zambia Daily Mail and Mwebantu were hardly analytical and critical in their coverage of the pandemic. The two publications simply regurgitated statistics on numbers of infections, recoveries, and mortality rate as announced by government officials, albeit with minimum effort to digest and unpack complex discourses for the ordinary reader.

Through 30 interviews with journalists, technologists, and media lawyers, I identify three main variables for the resistance to the development of newsroom security cultures, as well as a new social actor necessary for the development of security cultures in newsrooms: the security champion. The emergence of this new institutional entrepreneur highlights an intriguing tension. Although news organizations have engaged in slow adoption of the anonymous whistleblowing platform SecureDrop, they have not necessarily engaged in an institutionalization of security practices throughout the newsroom. The decoupling of these two factors represents attempts by news organizations to have institutional legitimacy while not changing core practices. In conjunction with this phenomenon, inspired individuals in newsrooms across the country are becoming ad hoc security champions in order to build security cultures from the ground up.","[Henrichsen, Jennifer R.] Univ Penn, Annenberg Sch Commun, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Henrichsen, Jennifer R.] Washington State Univ, Pullman, WA 99164 USA",University of Pennsylvania; Washington State University,"Henrichsen, JR (corresponding author), Univ Penn, Annenberg Sch Commun, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.;Henrichsen, JR (corresponding author), Washington State Univ, Pullman, WA 99164 USA.",jhenrichsen@asc.upenn.edu,,,Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University,Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University,The author gratefully acknowledges the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University for its financial support of this research through its Knight News Innovation Fellowship.,,60,3,3,2,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1751-2786,1751-2794,,JOURNAL PRACT,Journal.

The interviews exposed a lack of awareness of PJ in the case of foreign correspondents, and an interpretation that fundamentally differs from traditional understandings of the concept in the case of Kenyan reporters.

Such processes are complicated due to the enormous number of media items being produced, how quickly media items spread, and the often-subtle or sometimes invisible-to-the-naked-eye nature of deceptive edits. Despite knowing little about the provenance and veracity of the visual content they encounter, journalists have to quickly determine whether to re-publish or amplify this content, with few tools and little time available to assist them in such an evaluation. With the goal of equipping journalists with the mechanisms, skills, and knowledge to be effective gatekeepers and stewards of the public trust, this study reviews current journalistic image verification practices, examines a number of existing and emerging image verification technologies that could be deployed or adapted to aid in this endeavour, and identifies the strengths and limitations of the most promising extant technical approaches.

Motivated by a strong sense of justice and a passion to make a significant change, these journalists promote their social or political agenda in both spheres: the professional and the public. In the professional, they do it through an obsessive and continuing reporting on the issue they care for, while in the public sphere, they are personally involved in activities such as lobbying and consulting politicians and bureaucrats, or personal assistance to individuals and groups in need. Based on a thorough review of literature on journalism models and on studies of journalistic role perceptions, and after a series of in-depth interviews with 17 obsessive-activist journalists, the authors suggest that obsessive-activist journalism is a unique model of journalism and the most interventionist one. However, unlike other interventionist models of journalism, the obsessive-activist journalists adhere most of the time to traditional journalistic norms and practices. While former interventionist models challenged mainstream news reporting from outside, obsessive activists hybridize it from the inside, adding new avenues to adjust and survive in rapidly changing news environments.","[Ginosar, Avshalom] Acad Coll Yezreel Valley, Jezreel Valley, Israel; [Reich, Zvi] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Beer Sheva, Israel",Ben Gurion University,"Ginosar, A (corresponding author), Acad Coll Yezreel Valley, Jezreel Valley, Israel.",avshalomg@yvc.ac.il,,,,,,,69,3,3,2,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1751-2786,1751-2794,,JOURNAL PRACT,Journal.

We also found that both media outlets have similar patterns in terms of their narratives.","[Cortes-Sanchez, Julian David] Univ Rosario, Sch Management & Business, Bogota, Colombia; [Cortes-Sanchez, Julian David] Fudan Univ, Fudan Dev Inst, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Ibanez, Daniel Barredo] Univ Rosario, Sch Human Sci, Bogota, Colombia",Universidad del Rosario; Fudan University; Universidad del Rosario,"Cortes-Sanchez, JD (corresponding author), Univ Rosario, Sch Management & Business, Bogota, Colombia.;Cortes-Sanchez, JD (corresponding author), Fudan Univ, Fudan Dev Inst, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",julian.cortess@urosario.edu.co,"CortÃ©s, JuliÃ¡n D./B-7716-2016; Barredo, Daniel/AAC-3336-2020","CortÃ©s, JuliÃ¡n D./0000-0002-1246-2160; Barredo, Daniel/0000-0002-2259-0756",,,,,48,2,2,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1751-2786,1751-2794,,JOURNAL PRACT,Journal.

We find that the representation of these migrants in these two countries reflects the specific characteristics of each country's liberal media system model. In the U.S. coverage, characterized by a Liberal media system model that is relatively independent from government sources, the arrival of Central Americans is portrayed as a chaotic situation that overwhelmed border agencies and the immigration system. In doing so, it prevails a legacy discourse on the illegality of the phenomenon, highly characteristic of how U.S. media has historically depicted this population. In contrast, Mexican newspapers coverage is heavily influenced by official voices, depicting Central Americans as victims of human rights violations and as in-transit foreigners trying to reach the U.S. In this coverage, the government emerges as less accountable for the immigration crisis, reflecting its Captured Liberal media system model. By bringing together research in developed and developing nations, our comparative findings offer initial evidence about the influence of two media system models in shaping immigration news.","[Severino, Fernando] Illinois State Univ, Sch Commun, Normal, IL 61761 USA; [Salas, Valentina] Univ Minnesota, Polit Sci Dept, Minneapolis, MN USA",Illinois State University; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Severino, F (corresponding author), Illinois State Univ, Sch Commun, Normal, IL 61761 USA.",fseveri@ilstu.edu,,"Severino, Fernando/0000-0002-2890-1623",,,,,46,0,0,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1751-2786,1751-2794,,JOURNAL PRACT,Journal.

Drawing on a set of 16 semi-structured interviews with fact-checkers from 13 active initiatives, it delves into motivations that led journalists to put in motion their fact-checking firms. Based on the existing literature on structural dynamics and professional incentives for fact-checking, the paper suggests that these two instances concur with the advancement of that journalistic subgenre. Research findings show that the last two electoral cycles (2014-2018) created a thriving landscape for fact-checking due to growing political turmoil in Brazil. Besides, there is also an isomorphic tendency in the development of new fact-checking initiatives. Pioneer American and Argentinean fact-checking firms inspired first projects. Nevertheless, motivations for fact-checking have been increasingly diverse over the years, including training workshops, successful coalitions, and grants from foreign investors. This study contributes to the growing scholarship on an emerging journalistic subfield showing the context-sensitive nature of the expansion of the fact-checking enterprise in a milieu distinct from the US-European landscape. Furthermore, it stresses how structural and professional factors act as field-configuring instances of new journalistic ventures.","[Lelo, Thales] Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Commun & Arts, Sao Paulo, Brazil",Universidade de Sao Paulo,"Lelo, T (corresponding author), Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Commun & Arts, Sao Paulo, Brazil.",thales.lelo@gmail.com,,,Sao Paulo Research Foundation [2019/01330-0],Sao Paulo Research Foundation(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)),This work was supported by the Sao Paulo Research Foundation under Grant number 2019/01330-0.,,67,0,0,3,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1751-2786,1751-2794,,JOURNAL PRACT,Journal.

Public service broadcasters, which are often seen as paradigms of stable employment relationships, have been influenced by a highly competitive industry characterised by the outsourcing of content generation and the erosion of working conditions. The Spanish Public Radio and Television Corporation (RTVE) is no exception, in a context also influenced by the political clientelism distinguishing Mediterranean media systems. Accordingly, this study resorts to the classical exit, voice, and loyalty model to stress the importance of employment relationships for journalists. From this perspective, the analysis of TVE newsroom discourses invites the exploration of the role of the supervisor in access to employment and career opportunities, as well as its possible polarising effects that make it difficult for journalists to offer their full loyalty to the citizenry.","[Toledano, Samuel] Univ La Laguna, Dept Ciencias Comunicac & Trabajo Social, San Cristobal la Laguna, Islas Canarias, Spain; [Lamuedra Gravan, Maria] Univ Seville, Fac Comunicac, Seville, Spain; [Maria Garcia-de-Madariaga, Jose] Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Ciencias Comunicac & Sociol, Fuenlabrada, Spain",Universidad de la Laguna; University of Sevilla; Universidad Rey Juan Carlos,"Toledano, S (corresponding author), Univ La Laguna, Dept Ciencias Comunicac & Trabajo Social, San Cristobal la Laguna, Islas Canarias, Spain.",stoledano@ull.edu.es,"; Lamuedra Gravan, Maria/M-1400-2017; Toledano, Samuel/C-6949-2013","Garcia-de-Madariaga Miranda, Jose Maria/0000-0003-2168-6809; Lamuedra Gravan, Maria/0000-0002-3688-3488; Toledano, Samuel/0000-0003-0430-8347",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness 2013 National Programme for Research Aimed at the Challenges of Society [CSO2013-45470-R]; European Regional Development Fund,Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness 2013 National Programme for Research Aimed at the Challenges of Society; European Regional Development Fund(European Commission),"This paper forms part of the Dinamicas de relacion ante el cambio social: contextos, contenidos, productores, publico y produsuarios en las noticias de TVE e YLE (CSO2013-45470-R) research project, financed by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness 2013 National Programme for Research Aimed at the Challenges of Society, and led by Maria Lamuedra and Manuel Angel Vazquez Medel.

The pandemic, and the severe restrictions oncampus attendance, radically altered J schools' value proposition to their students, turning the teaching of practical journalistic skills primarily into a forced blended learning experience. This study, through proposing a conceptual model for unpacking value creation dynamics in journalism education, explores this shift and how journalism students responded to it. We find, through applying the model to a multiplatform journalism course at the bachelor level, that the online teaching environment was experienced as being inferior to physical teaching, despite the availability of flexible digital learning resources that students could use at their convenience. Ample opportunities for online interaction between students and teachers were not a satisfactory substitute for physical campus teaching. This study questions how, based on this, face-to-face interaction between journalism students and teachers best can be replaced, especially in terms of creating a safe learning environment and facilitating students' learning by doing.","[Olsen, Ragnhild Kristine] Oslo Metropolitan Univ, Dept Journalism & Media Studies, Oslo, Norway; [Olsen, Ragnhild Kristine; Olsen, Gunhild Ring; Rosok-Dahl, Heidi] BI Norwegian Business Sch, Dept Commun & Culture, Oslo, Norway; [Olsen, Gunhild Ring] Kristiania Univ Coll, Dept Commun, Oslo, Norway",Oslo Metropolitan University (OsloMet); BI Norwegian Business School; Kristiania University College,"Olsen, RK (corresponding author), Oslo Metropolitan Univ, Dept Journalism & Media Studies, Oslo, Norway.;Olsen, RK (corresponding author), BI Norwegian Business Sch, Dept Commun & Culture, Oslo, Norway.",ragols@oslomet.no,,"Olsen, Ragnhild Kristine/0000-0003-3072-8046; Olsen, Gunhild Ring/0000-0002-0847-5823",,,,,39,1,1,3,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1751-2786,1751-2794,,JOURNAL PRACT,Journal.

Using the case of COVID-19, the study examined how journalists from community media in Zambia and Tanzania reported government information that conflicted with what the local communities they served believed to be untrue. Drawing from interviews with journalists from community media organizations, we were able to demonstrate that there was a schism between what the editors thought as newsworthy versus what the reporters believed as possessing journalistic values relevant for their communities. Unlike the reporters, most editors aligned much with what the government wanted the media to transmit. This is especially true in Zambia where reporters indicated that most of their stories were flagged as irrelevant by their editors. These findings are then examined through the lens of gatekeeping, particularly a focus on various levels of analysis.","[Gondwe, Gregory] Calif State Univ San Bernardino, Dept Commun Studies, San Bernardino, CA 92407 USA; [Ferrucci, Patrick] Univ Colorado, Dept Journalism, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Tandoc, Edson C., Jr.] Wee Kim Sch Commun & Informat, Singapore, Singapore",California State University System; California State University San Bernardino; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; Nanyang Technological University & National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore; Nanyang Technological University,"Ferrucci, P (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Dept Journalism, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",patrick.ferrucci@colorado.edu,"Gondwe, Gregory/K-5960-2019","Gondwe, Gregory/0000-0001-7444-2731; FERRUCCI, PATRICK/0000-0002-4535-0210; Tandoc, Edson/0000-0002-8740-9313",,,,,48,0,0,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1751-2786,1751-2794,,JOURNAL PRACT,Journal.

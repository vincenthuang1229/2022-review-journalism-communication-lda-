However, unless researchers consider the systemtic structures of racial inequities when designing their simulations, they may unintentionally create experiences that could prime or entrench racist beliefs or attitudes. A critical Whiteness framework guides this systematic review of 20 years of prejudice and bias reduction research in VEs. Of the 68 articles, findings indicated that virtual experiences are a promising tool in anti-bias interventions. Future research must expand to more longitudinal, behaviorally focused studies while prioritizing predictive theoretical models and meaningfully reflecting on inclusive practices within the broader bias reduction space. We discuss best practices for future research in anti-bias and anti-prejudice in VEs. Lay Summary Virtual environments (VEs) provide new and powerful ways users can experience people and places where researchers can examine and reduce racial bias. However, these experiences may accidentally provoke or strengthen racist beliefs when creating virtual worlds without considering existing racial inequities in academia. We apply a critical race framework to assess patterns within 20 years of research using VEs for prejudice and bias reduction. Of the 68 articles, findings showed that VEs are a promising tool for racial bias interventions. Future research should examine behavior changes over time while integrating theoretical models and reflecting on inclusive techniques within the broader bias reduction space.

In this article, we attempt to identify some of its overarching patterns by sorting social media content into different rituals, patterned ways of communicating where people express and negotiate shared values. We integrate theoretical literature on rituals with empirical studies of social media genres to develop a typology of 16 rituals. Each ritual conveys different values, ranging from respect and responsibility to materialism and pleasure. Rituals also convey different notions of what counts as good communication, emphasizing one of four communicative values: authenticity, persuasion, affiliation, or demonstration. In our conclusion, we discuss how our framework can support future comparative research on what people post to social media. Given its massive volume and rapid development of new trends, the universe of user-generated content may seem utterly chaotic. Yet the flow of content is underlined by deep-rooted patterns of communication. In this article, we present the first systematic attempt to identify these patterns using the concept of social media rituals. Understood as typified communicative practices that formalize and express shared values, rituals offer a productive path to categorize popular genres of content and trace the values they convey. Integrating theoretical literature on rituals with empirical studies of social media genres, we develop a typology of 16 rituals that express diverse values, ranging from respect and responsibility to materialism and pleasure. Furthermore, we show that rituals embed different notions of good communication, as reflected in the values of authenticity, persuasion, affiliation, and demonstration. Finally, we discuss how our framework can facilitate comparative investigations of user-generated content and platform values.","[Trillo, Tommaso; Hallinan, Blake; Shifman, Limor] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Commun & Journalism, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel",Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"Trillo, T (corresponding author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Commun & Journalism, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel.",tommaso.trillo@mail.huji.ac.il,,"Hallinan, Blake/0000-0002-4696-8290",European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union [819004],European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union(European Research Council (ERC)),This project has received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program [Grant Agreement No. 819004].,,58,0,0,22,22,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1083-6101,,,J COMPUT-MEDIAT COMM,J.

This often happens in public places like on trains, in cafes, or waiting rooms. These areas are typically more distracting than, for example, a quiet living room or office. It is therefore possible that people pay less attention to news on a smartphone and learn less from it when they use it in public. This study conducts an experiment where we compare attention to news on a smartphone and how much people learn from it in two different settings: A bustling student cafeteria and a quiet laboratory room. We measured attention by using eye-tracking, a technique that helps us to see where people gaze on a smartphone screen. We find that people pay more attention to a smartphone newsfeed in public. We also find that people recall less information but answer more quiz questions correctly if they saw the newsfeed on their smartphone in public compared to in private. Our study cannot fully explain this difference in learning, but we can show that paying more attention to news on a smartphone makes people learn more, regardless of the environment they are in. People increasingly turn to news on mobile devices, often while out and about, attending to daily tasks. Yet, we know little about whether attention to and learning from information on a mobile differs by the setting of use. This study builds on Multiple Resource Theory () and the Resource Competition Framework () to compare visual attention to a dynamic newsfeed, varying only the setting: private or public. We use mobile eye-tracking to evaluate the effects of setting on attention and assess correspondent learning differences after exposure to the feed, which allows us to uncover a relationship between attention and learning. Findings indicate higher visual attention to mobile newsfeed posts in public, relative to a private setting. Moreover, scrolling through news on a smartphone in public attenuates some knowledge gain but is beneficial for other learning outcomes.","[Ohme, Jakob] Free Univ Berlin, Weizenbaum Inst Networked Soc, Berlin, Germany; [Ohme, Jakob; de Vreese, Claes H.] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Commun Res, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Searles, Kathleen] Louisiana State Univ, Manship Sch Mass Commun, Polit Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Searles, Kathleen] Louisiana State Univ, Polit Sci, Mass Commun, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA",Free University of Berlin; University of Amsterdam; Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University; Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University,"Ohme, J (corresponding author), Free Univ Berlin, Weizenbaum Inst Networked Soc, Berlin, Germany.;Ohme, J (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Commun Res, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",j.ohme@fu-berlin.de,,,Research Priority Area Communication and its Digital Communication Methods Lab (digicomlab.eu) at the University of Amsterdam,Research Priority Area Communication and its Digital Communication Methods Lab (digicomlab.eu) at the University of Amsterdam,This study was funded by the Research Priority Area Communication and its Digital Communication Methods Lab (digicomlab.eu) at the University of Amsterdam.,,71,0,0,1,1,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1083-6101,,,J COMPUT-MEDIAT COMM,J.

The study had two aims. The first aim was to explore and understand the social and physical settings where children use their smartphones, and what kinds of communicative practices they engage with while using their smartphones. The second aim was to explore and analyze what children know about privacy in relation to where they use their smartphones and how they use them. The findings of the study suggest that children think of their smartphones and the content of their mobile communication as private. Their understanding of privacy can depend on the where they use their smartphone and what kinds of communication takes place on their smartphones. The findings also reveal that children who are 8- to 11-years old can value the peace of mind that their smartphones give to their parents more than their own locational privacy. Children start using smartphones increasingly from early ages. This makes it more difficult for them to develop an understanding of online privacy and managing their personal data. Many parents monitor and regulate children's online media use. However, they also encourage using smartphones to ensure the safety and security of their children. This study explores how children use smartphones in relation to their understanding of privacy of communication, content, data, and location. It examines data from 7 focus groups with arts-based methods conducted with 37 children in UK. The findings suggest that children think of their smartphones as a private communication technology and a private place, and they manage their locational privacy based on the necessity of using a mobile app and through adjusting the location settings on their phones. The findings also suggest that privacy of mobile data and user content are dependent on where mobile communication takes place.","[Ozkul, Didem] Bilkent Univ, Dept Commun & Design, TR-06800 Cankaya, Turkey",Ihsan Dogramaci Bilkent University,"Ozkul, D (corresponding author), Bilkent Univ, Dept Commun & Design, TR-06800 Cankaya, Turkey.",didem.ozkul@bilkent.edu.tr,"Ozkul, Didem/C-8087-2019","Ozkul, Didem/0000-0002-7889-8020","Department of Culture, Communication and Media, University College London","Department of Culture, Communication and Media, University College London","I thank the Rhodes Avenue Primary School, and all the children who took part in the study.

This article offers a deep and rare exploration of the inequalities facing those on the wrong side of the digital divide, demonstrating a painful feeling of powerlessness. Residents wait for a home broadband connection with no idea when their waiting will end. They wait while using the internet with poor connection speeds leading to buffering, lag, and slow download and upload speeds. To avoid these technology-induced types of waiting, residents wait in alternative ways. Most striking, this includes second-shift families that wait until the middle of the night to enjoy improved internet service and entertainment. Waiting is a way of experiencing the effects of power. This article finds those waiting for fixed broadband connection are powerless to end the waiting and increasingly frustrated with the powerful-the governmental officials, policy makers, and broadband providers-who control their waiting. This article, built on 19 interviews with residents of a rural county in the United States, details the lived experiences of those waiting for a fixed broadband connection and shines a critical light on the unequal power dynamics of digital inequality and waiting. The findings demonstrate residents suffer from chronic waiting for a connection. They also wait while using the internet, via inferior mobile connections, laboring through issues such as buffering. Finally, the findings illustrate the only way to avoid technology-induced waiting is to wait in alternative ways, including turning into a second-shift family to enjoy internet service in the middle of the night.","[Mathews, Nick] Univ Missouri, Dept Commun & Journalism, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA; [Ali, Christopher] Penn State Univ, Donald P Bellisario Coll Commun, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Kansas City; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Mathews, N (corresponding author), Univ Missouri, Dept Commun & Journalism, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA.",nem636@umsystem.edu,,"Mathews, Nick/0000-0002-3674-9131",,,,,81,0,0,0,0,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1083-6101,,,J COMPUT-MEDIAT COMM,J.

However, some users creatively adapt Pages to their needs, one of which is to memorialize and publicize ordinary people. In this study, we closely examine 18 memorial Pages, which were created in memory of ordinary people who died in nonordinary circumstances. Yet despite the anonymity of the deceased, these Pages reach a vast number of followers, and generate and display extensive activity both online and offline. Our findings depict how users lead this process, from the early stages of creating and naming the Page-against Facebook's official policy-to the maintenance of the Page activity and their relationship with followers. These users, who become administrators (admins), use their network of followers to accumulate various resources: money donations, physical attendance in memorial events, emotional support, and more. These resources amount to the social capital that admins generate. Admins portray the deceased as a respectable person, whose story carries special social significance and collective moral value. They then establish a link between digital engagement metrics (Likes, Shares), and cognitive or emotive implications-public memory, recognition, and esteem. This study focuses on users' practices involved in creating and maintaining Facebook memorial Pages by adapting the theoretical perspective of the social capital approach. It examines 18 Pages in Israel, which are dedicated to ordinary people who died in nonordinary circumstances. We employ qualitative analysis based on a digital ethnography conducted between 2018 and 2021. Our findings show how memorial Pages serve as social capital resources for admin users. Admins negotiate Facebook affordances when creating, designing, and maintaining such Pages. They discursively position the deceased as a respectable public figure worth remembering and their followers, who are otherwise strangers, as vital partners in this process. The resources followers provide range from economic capital and practical support to solidarity and emotional support. Finally, we point at the perceived connection users make between visible/measurable online engagement (Like, Share, Follow), and cognitive or emotive implications-public memory, recognition, and esteem.","[Navon, Sarit; Noy, Chaim] Bar Ilan Univ, Sch Commun, Ramat Gan, Israel",Bar Ilan University,"Noy, C (corresponding author), Bar Ilan Univ, Sch Commun, Ramat Gan, Israel.",chaim.noy@biu.ac.il,,,,,,,53,0,0,0,0,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1083-6101,,,J COMPUT-MEDIAT COMM,J.

To better understand it, we examined whether humorous content reduced online incivility and whether the (in)civility of another user might mitigate or amplify this effect in two experiments (Study 1, N = 122; Study 2, N = 208). Participants in both experiments read an online opinion article about an instance of negative stereotyping and provided a comment on a simulated online news forum. The first study manipulated article humor (humorous vs. not humorous). The second study manipulated humor and the (in)civility of a previous user's comment (civil vs. uncivil). In both studies, humor-reduced incivility. Anger mediated this effect. Source liking mediated the positive effect of humor on reducing anger. The (in)civility of a previous comment did not affect these results. Overall, the findings point to the value of humor and anger reduction in managing online incivility. Lay Summary Online incivility is a common occurrence in online public forums. This article investigated factors that may reduce incivility in two online experiments. The first experiment tested whether humor reduced anger and subsequently the incivility of participants' comments towards a negative stereotype-challenging op-ed article. The second experiment tested whether exposure to civil and uncivil previous user comments influenced the civility of participants' comments. Humor was found to reduce online incivility by reducing feelings of anger and increasing liking towards the author in both experiments. Exposure to another user's comment, whether civil or uncivil, did not appear to influence the civility of participants' comments, suggesting that article content is a more likely trigger for online incivility.","[Elsayed, Yomna] Univ Utah, Dept Commun, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Hollingshead, Andrea B.] Univ Southern Calif, Annenberg Sch Commun & Journalism, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah; University of Southern California,"Elsayed, Y (corresponding author), Univ Utah, Dept Commun, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.",yomna.ali@gmail.com,,,,,,,57,0,0,20,27,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1083-6101,,,J COMPUT-MEDIAT COMM,J.

Based on the social identity model of deindividuation effects model (SIDE) and social identity theory, we proposed and tested the idea that observers of a supportive interaction online could relate to the observed support seeker based on their shared gender and, in turn, become vicariously influenced by the support provider's message to the support seeker. An experiment using a sample of young adults (N = 326) in the United States provided support to the proposition. Furthermore, the outcomes of the vicarious interaction were qualified by the genders of the observed interactants and enhanced by the lack of profile photos. The findings advance the understandings of vicarious interaction in online context and guide the design of online communities to promote mental well-being. Lay Summary Ample evidence shows that people benefit tremendously from participating in online health support communities, but less is understood about how people who do not actively participate in interactions benefit from these communities. We conducted an online experiment using a sample of young adults in the United States. The results showed that females, compared with males, are more likely to be persuaded to seek professional counseling for mental health issues from observing a supportive conversation online. The persuasive effect of reading supportive interactions was enhanced when female participants shared the same gender with the observed support seeker and when the observed interactants had no profile photos.","[(Nancy) Dai, Yue] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Media & Commun, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Shi, Jingyuan] Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Dept Commun Studies, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",City University of Hong Kong; Hong Kong Baptist University,"Dai, Y (corresponding author), City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Media & Commun, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",nancy.dai@cityu.edu.hk,,"DAI, Yue (Nancy)/0000-0001-6734-907X; Shi, Jingyuan/0000-0001-5675-4512","Faculty Research Grant, Department of Media and Communication, City University of Hong Kong [9618015]; Faculty Research Start-up Grant, City University of Hong Kong [7200638]; Hong Kong Baptist University","Faculty Research Grant, Department of Media and Communication, City University of Hong Kong; Faculty Research Start-up Grant, City University of Hong Kong; Hong Kong Baptist University","This research was funded by the following research grants: 1.

Most online sites use humans to monitor such content. But, there is so much of this content each day that platforms have started using artificial intelligence (AI) to automatically flag and stop its spread. AI can be better than human moderators. It uses the same consistent criteria for classification, and it is faster. But, the problem is that people do not trust AI with such an important responsibility. One way to increase their trust is to involve humans in the moderation task. Another is to allow users to provide feedback on the classification. We conducted an experiment to test these ideas. Participants were told that the content was classified either by an AI, or by humans, or by both working together. Also, some participants were provided with a list of rules used for classification. Others were allowed to provide feedback about the rules. A third group did not receive any rules. We discovered that letting users provide feedback increased trust. Trust in AI also depends on the perceptions that users have about AI for moderating content. Given the scale of user-generated content online, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to flag problematic posts is inevitable, but users do not trust such automated moderation of content. We explore if (a) involving human moderators in the curation process and (b) affording interactive transparency, wherein users participate in curation, can promote appropriate reliance on AI. We test this through a 3 (Source: AI, Human, Both) x 3 (Transparency: No Transparency, Transparency-Only, Interactive Transparency) x 2 (Classification Decision: Flagged, Not Flagged) between-subjects online experiment (N = 676) involving classification of hate speech and suicidal ideation.

We identify affordances as a source of value for digital possessions and argue that dominant meaning-orientated approaches do not enable us to fully appreciate these sources of value. Our work recognizes that value is released and experienced in the doing-people must do things with digital objects to locate and obtain value in and from them. We distinguish three levels of affordance for digital possessions-low, mid, and high-and introduce the concept of digital incorporation to explain how the three levels of affordances come together, with the individual's own intentionality to enable the achievement of goals.

Participants' (n = 36) narratives were analyzed through four coding cycles: in vivo, initial, value, and focused coding. Interviews with romantic couples resulted in three themes: rules are performative, rules reduce conflict, and rules guide modality weaving. During an expectation violation, findings revealed that the magnitude of the violation is first determined by the violator defending their behavior. Then, based on the appraisal process, the couple reframes the rule to better work for their future interactions. Key findings conclude that rules are not rigid; they are fluid and develop naturally over time. This research adds to the literature about how mediated communication transforms the dynamics of romantic relationships as couples explicitly and implicitly create communication rules to help maintain their partnership. Lay Summary This qualitative investigation examines how couples create and negotiate their communication rules for technology use. Through interviews with 18 couples in committed romantic relationships, this study found that communication rules serve three central purposes: (a) rules become part of the couple's relational performance. (b) Rules offer a strategy for conflict management. (c) Rules help navigate modality weaving as couples explore how to best incorporate technology into their daily interactions. Additionally, when one member breaks an established communication rule, the couple often reframes the rule to better work for their future interactions. This study discovered that communication rules come and go as the individuals in the relationship change and evolve their communication practices. Individuals are constantly navigating social norms, and this requires negotiation. Mobile technologies make the rules process tangible and remind us that communication rules are flexible, contextual, and help couples reduce conflict.","[Foster Campbell, Jamie] Univ Illinois, Dept Commun, 1007 W Harrison St, Chicago, IL 60607 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital,"Campbell, JF (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Commun, 1007 W Harrison St, Chicago, IL 60607 USA.",jfoste2@uic.edu,,"Campbell, Jamie/0000-0002-3539-8667",,,,,48,0,0,13,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1083-6101,,,J COMPUT-MEDIAT COMM,J.

This article reports on the development and validation of two measures that categorize the types of emails employees send/receive into two different constructs based on the perceived importance and importance and urgency. The measures were developed using Buss and Craik's Act Frequency Approach. Analysis determined that our six-item important email and our eight-item important and urgent email scales were both reliable and valid measures of the constructs. Construct validity was demonstrated by embedding our measures in a nomological network linking email demands to employee well-being. The measures were found to be significant predictors of work-role overload, even when the more traditional measures used to quantify the demands imposed on employees by email were taken into account. Lay Summary This article presents two scales that can be used to measure the extent to which an employee perceives an email to be: (a) important and (b) both important and urgent. As expected by theory, both measures were found to predict employees' feelings of being overloaded by their work. The interesting findings from this study are the following. First, employees seem to consider urgent emails to be important, perhaps without consideration to the email's actual importance to the employee. Second, emails that are both important and urgent usually involve a key stakeholder being impacted if the email is not acted on quickly. Third, important emails are not necessarily considered urgent. To make an email urgent the sender has to explicitly state how the contents of the email will negatively impact key stakeholders. Finally, our findings suggest that reducing the volume of email someone has to process may not, on its own, lead to reduced employee stress. Rather, employers who seek to improve employee well-being should focus their efforts on reducing the volume of emails employees consider to be important and both important and urgent.","[Lanctot, Andre; Duxbury, Linda] Carleton Univ, Sprott Sch Business, Ottawa, ON, Canada",Carleton University,"Lanctot, A (corresponding author), Carleton Univ, Sprott Sch Business, Ottawa, ON, Canada.",andre.lanctot@carleton.ca,,"Lanctot, Andre/0000-0001-8903-9144",Building Healthier Workplaces Conference and Mitacs [IT03917],Building Healthier Workplaces Conference and Mitacs,We would like to acknowledge the Building Healthier Workplaces Conference and Mitacs (Grant Number: IT03917) for being key supporters this research and funding it.,,62,0,0,8,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1083-6101,,,J COMPUT-MEDIAT COMM,J.

This approach is important given the widespread use of social media during the pandemic and the rise of meme-based communication on social media. The study found that memes from an expert source are more credible and persuasive than those from a nonexpert source. The same applied to memes with an objective message over those with a subjective message. The credibility of a meme also improved its persuasiveness, meaning that users were more likely to like it, comment on it, and share it with others. As expected, younger people were more likely to like, share, and comments on memes. Overall, pro-mask/vaccine memes were more credible and persuasive than anti-mask/vaccines memes. These results suggest that public health campaigns may benefit by incorporating memes in their communications. This study used an experimental design to examine the credibility and persuasiveness of COVID-19-related Internet memes. The study used a random sample of U.S. social media users (N = 1,200) with source credibility as the theoretical framework. Results indicate that memes with expert source attribution are more credible than those with nonexpert source attribution. The same applies to the persuasiveness of the memes. Memes with an objective message tone are also more credible and persuasive than those with a subjective message tone. Additionally, there is a positive correlation between the credibility of a meme and its persuasiveness. Age correlates inversely with persuasion and pro-mask/vaccine memes are more credible and persuasive than anti-mask/vaccines memes. These results have implications regarding COVID-19 messaging as well as on meme-based communication.","[Ben Wasike] Univ Texas Rio Grande Valley, Dept Commun, Brownsville, TX 78520 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Rio Grande Valley,"Ben Wasike (corresponding author), Univ Texas Rio Grande Valley, Dept Commun, Brownsville, TX 78520 USA.",ben.wasike@utrgv.edu,"Wasike, Ben/V-3993-2019","Wasike, Ben/0000-0003-1652-9999","Henry W.

However, these depictions have been challenged in online popular culture, particularly in memes. By utilizing the concepts of double articulation of media and cultural imaginaries, this article reveals how memes shape popular definitions of darknet. Our qualitative, social semiotic content analysis of 505 memes reveals an ambiguous and complex vision of the darknet that both supports and demystifies the mainstream imagery. We introduce the concept of discursive malleability of niche technologies to describe how cultural practices reshape technologies, especially those with small userbases. Additionally, we present a representational map of the darknet and indicate how this contributes to social understanding of digital technologies more generally, and, not least why the analyzed memes may be read as lens exposing contradictory notions and policies regarding digital technologies nowadays. Lay Summary People use memes to discuss topics important to them and to tell others something about themselves. Our research shows how memes describe the darknet, the part of the internet that requires specific tools to access and makes users anonymous. We ask how memes portray the darknet and whether or not they support popular views about it. We analyzed 505 memes searching for different themes related to the darknet, asking what they mean for people's thoughts on the darknet and online spaces in general. Darknet is used by a relatively small number of people. This is the reason why it is an example of a discursively malleable technology. For these technologies, it is particularly important how people think of them as such views shape how they act and what they see as wrong or right. We also show how this contributes to discussing current changes of the internet.","[Siuda, Piotr] Kazimierz Wielki Univ, Jana Karola Chodkiewicza 30, PL-85064 Bydgoszcz, Poland; [Nowak, Jakub] Marie Curie Sklodowska Univ, Pl M Curie Sklodowskiej 5, PL-20031 Lublin, Poland; [Gehl, Robert W.] York Univ, 4700 Keele St, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada",Kazimierz Wielki University; Maria Curie-Sklodowska University; York University - Canada,"Siuda, P (corresponding author), Kazimierz Wielki Univ, Jana Karola Chodkiewicza 30, PL-85064 Bydgoszcz, Poland.",piotr@ukw.edu.pl,,,"Polish National Science Center (Narodowe Centrum Nauki) [2020/37/B/HS6/00941, 2021/43/B/HS6/00710]",Polish National Science Center (Narodowe Centrum Nauki),This research is supported by the Polish National Science Center (Narodowe Centrum Nauki) grants: 2020/37/B/HS6/00941 and 2021/43/B/HS6/00710.

How do such actions affect them? We conducted a study to see whether showing news readers a comment button or thumbs up/thumbs down button on a website made them feel different. We also checked whether leaving a comment or clicking the thumbs up/thumbs down button changed their thinking. Results showed that when people saw a comment button, they believed the site to be more interactive. They felt like they had more of a say. It encouraged them to discuss politics. It also made them feel less distant and cold toward people with opposing views. However, when users actually left a comment or clicked a thumbs up/thumbs down button, they showed stronger beliefs in their own prior opinions. This led to more extreme attitudes. In this way, features on online sites can have both positive and negative effects. There is a big difference between the effects of seeing the features and acting on them. By performing actions such as liking a post, commenting on it, or sharing it with others, we are constantly expressing our opinions about ongoing news and public affairs on online media platforms. How do these acts of expression affect our feelings and opinions? We address this question from an affordance perspective, focusing on the effects of both the presence of the expression affordance (cue effects) and users' actual engagement with it (action effects). We conducted an online experiment (N = 368) on a news website with thumbs-up/down and/or commenting as low-effort and high-effort expression affordances, respectively. Data revealed that the low-effort affordance led to more affective polarization while the high-effort affordance promoted increased interest in deliberation. Merely presenting a commenting cue mitigated affective polarization by increasing perceived interactivity. However, when users engaged the affordance by providing comments, it tended to reinforce pre-existing opinions. These findings have theoretical and practical implications.","[Wang, Jinping] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Sch Journalism & Commun, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Sundar, S.

AI arranges posts based on user preferences and helps users easily create and share social media posts. AI-based algorithms underlying social media make decisions and initiate actions when interacting with human users, suggesting that machine agency and human agency coexist in human-machine interactions on AI-based social media. This study explores how TikTok users collaborate with AI, specifically focusing on the dynamics between human agency and machine agency, and how such dynamics shape user engagement. In-depth interviews with 25 TikTok users indicate that users are largely receptive to the personalized experiences offered by AI-enabled algorithms. Human users and AI-based algorithms also influence each other when the two interact, leading to human-AI synergy effects. Users try to train algorithms to provide a personalized feed that caters to their interests more precisely. AI also facilitates users' content creation and networking by reducing the efforts to exercise user agency. This study also finds that AI-user collaboration on TikTok influences user engagement with the platform and social-interactive engagement. These findings advance our understanding of how human agency driven by users and machine agency driven by AI collaboratively transform user engagement. Artificial intelligence (AI) technology has vastly reshaped user experiences on social media. AI-powered social media use and its outcomes largely depend on how users collaborate with AI that exercises agency. Through in-depth interviews with TikTok users, this study investigates how users collaborate with AI when using AI-powered social media and how such dynamics shape user engagement. We found that TikTok users are receptive to personalized experiences enabled by machine agency. However, by influencing each other, user agency and machine agency also led to user-AI synergy. Users deliberately influence content curation algorithms to make them cater more precisely to their needs; AI also facilitates users' content creation and networking. Such AI-user collaboration on TikTok significantly influences medium engagement and social-interactive engagement. These findings advance our understanding of the dynamics between human agency and machine agency and, thus, how AI transforms user experiences on social media.","[Kang, Hyunjin; Lou, Chen] Nanyang Technol Univ, Wee Kim Wee Sch Commun & Informat, Singapore, Singapore",Nanyang Technological University & National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore; Nanyang Technological University,"Kang, H (corresponding author), Nanyang Technol Univ, Wee Kim Wee Sch Commun & Informat, Singapore, Singapore.",hjkang@ntu.edu.sg,,,"Ministry of Education, Singapore [2019-T1-002-115]; Special Teaching and Research (STAR) Fund from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore","Ministry of Education, Singapore(Ministry of Education, Singapore); Special Teaching and Research (STAR) Fund from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore","The research was supported by the first author's Tier 1 Grant (2019-T1-002-115) from Ministry of Education, Singapore and Special Teaching and Research (STAR) Fund from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.",,71,0,0,71,71,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1083-6101,,,J COMPUT-MEDIAT COMM,J.

The effect of such hateful utterances can involve severe psychological harm, especially for youths who have to master developmental tasks. Therefore, drawing on criminology's routine activity theory, this study investigates the factors that help explain why youths become victimized through online hate speech. We conducted a national quota-based quantitative online survey that was representative of adolescent and young adult online users (N = 1,180). In the results, we identified six latent profiles of young targets with overall high or low online hate speech victimization, victimization due to gender, migration background, religion, or political engagement on behalf of the queer community. While relative subjective deprivation, political participation, and lower digital media literacy positively predicted overall victimization through online hate speech, being targeted was more likely for members of the aforementioned social groups and those showing political engagement. Lay Summary Many adolescents and young adults are affected by online hate speech. When a person is exposed to statements that offend a group of people they feel they belong to, it can have devastating consequences. This is especially the case with youths, who do not yet have a consolidated personality. Consequently, drawing on a criminological theoretical framework, we seek to explain why youths become targets of online hate speech. For this purpose, we surveyed 1,180 adolescents and young adults in Germany. We found groups of young people who are significantly (or very little) affected by online hate speech against the various groups they belong to. In addition, groups of youths experience being insulted online only due to their gender, migration background, religion, or commitment to the queer community. We also found that youths who see themselves as disadvantaged compared to others, are politically engaged online, and are less comfortable with and competent in social media are more likely to be affected by online hate speech.","[Obermaier, Magdalena] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Media & Commun, Oettingenstr 67, D-80538 Munich, Germany; [Schmuck, Desiree] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Sch Mass Commun Res, Leuven, Belgium",University of Munich; KU Leuven,"Obermaier, M (corresponding author), Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Media & Commun, Oettingenstr 67, D-80538 Munich, Germany.",obermaier@ifkw.lmu.de,,"Obermaier, Magdalena/0000-0002-3055-3744",,,,,60,0,0,11,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1083-6101,,,J COMPUT-MEDIAT COMM,J.

Applying the im/mobilities framework, this study explains how different left-behind caregivers use mediated communication as communicative mobilities to negotiate family roles and relationships in situated transnational power geometry. Despite the common structural constraints (rural patriarchy and inadequate social resources), left-behind women's socio-structural immobilities vary depending on their specific relationship with migrants (conjugal, kinship, and intergenerational dynamics), which embodies the asymmetrical nature of transnationalism. The findings highlight the dynamic negotiation between left-behind caregivers' communicative mobilities and their contextualized socio-structural immobilities, which leads to diverse forms of agency and disempowerment. This article shows that communicative mobility is not only manifested as media use but also embodied as media (non)use. Lay Summary Transnational labor migration has allowed people in poor areas to improve their financial well-being, but has also caused separations among many families. Thanks to the prevalence of various digital media (e.g., instant messaging, webcam and voice calls, and social media platforms, etc.), fragmented family members are able to maintain and manage different family relationships despite geographic constraints. This study draws on three groups of female caregivers (mothers, aunts, and grandmothers) in Fuqing, a major transnational migrant-labor-sending area in China. I am particularly interested in how these left-behind women collaborate with migrant parents to fulfil their duties of raising left-behind children through digital media. The findings suggest that left-behind women's life experiences are not only related to gender norms and inadequate social resources (e.g., a lack of job opportunities and robust social welfare system) in rural China, but also pertinent to their specific relationship with migrants (e.g., conjugal, kinship, and intergenerational dynamics). While female caregivers' different situations influence their media practices during childrearing collaboration with migrant parents, such media engagement also contributes to the shaping of their transnational family relationships.","[Chen, Hong] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Humanities, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Shanghai University of Finance & Economics,"Chen, H (corresponding author), Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Humanities, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",red0422@live.cn,"Chen, Hong/AEA-0888-2022","Chen, Hong/0000-0002-9771-6464",,,,,85,0,0,24,31,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1083-6101,,,J COMPUT-MEDIAT COMM,J.

Prior work on this topic has primarily focused on individual and technological factors while overlooking the role of interpersonal dynamics. To fill this gap, this study examines if and how players' perceptions of mutual dependence and power in MMO games are related to toxicity and prosocial behavior in games. Results from a survey of 782 Chinese game players suggest that players' perceived power is positively related to prosocial behavior in games. Perceived mutual dependence and power are also indirectly related to prosocial and toxic behaviors through players' passion for games. This study has theoretical implications for scholarship on toxicity, prosocial behaviors, and gameplay, while also providing design and policy implications for MMO games. Lay Summary In this article, we seek to understand why people engage in prosocial and toxic behaviors in massively multiplayer online (MMO) games. We assumed that players' perceptions of mutual dependence among teammates and power as compared to teammates were related to their toxic and prosocial behaviors in MMO games. We also anticipated that players' passion for games was related to their behaviors in games. Through a survey of 782 Chinese game players, we found that when players perceived that they had more power than their teammates, they were more likely to engage in prosocial behaviors. Players' perceptions of mutual dependence and power were positively associated with their passion for games, which was further linked to their prosocial and toxic behaviors in games. Specifically, when players had an uncontrollable urge to play games (i.e., obsessive passion), they were more likely to perform toxicity; when players' passion indicated concordance between games and their pre-existing values (i.e., harmonious passion), players were more likely to carry out prosocial behaviors. We discuss our findings in terms of their theoretical and practical implications.","[Zhu, Zicheng; Zhang, Renwen] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Commun & New Media, Singapore, Singapore; [Qin, Yuren] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Media & Int Culture, Mainland, Peoples R China",National University of Singapore; Zhejiang University,"Zhang, RW (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Commun & New Media, Singapore, Singapore.",r.zhang@nus.edu.sg,,"Zhang, Renwen/0000-0002-7636-9598",National University of Singapore [R-124-000-128-133],National University of Singapore(National University of Singapore),This research is supported by the National University of Singapore Start-up Grant (R-124-000-128-133).

The study draws from qualitative interviews with 17 Norwegian adolescents. The findings indicate that adolescents are ambivalent about their relationships with social networking sites, producing ripple effects on their motivation and disconnection practices. The findings are explained through the cultivation of narrative identity. Thus, this article proposes that adolescent digital disconnection is aligned with identity formation, reflected in narrative themes and corresponding features. By detailing how ongoing identity construction processes underpin the need and ability to disconnect, this article contributes a developmental perspective to the digital disconnection literature. Lay Summary Adolescents only know a connected world, but they admit that they disconnect from the disadvantages of constant connectivity. This study offers an inside perspective regarding the what, why, and how of digital disconnection. The findings illustrate that some adolescents log off spontaneously to recover from the emotional distress triggered by social media, while others endeavor to reduce their screen time in favor of personal growth. These differences seem to sync with the question, Who am I really? Adolescents with a sense of identity can better withstand pressure from peers to stay online, choosing disconnection or connection independently rather than because of their peers.","[Agai, Mehri S.] Univ Bergen, Dept Informat Sci & Media Studies, Bergen, Norway",University of Bergen,"Agai, MS (corresponding author), Univ Bergen, Dept Informat Sci & Media Studies, Bergen, Norway.",mehri.agai@uib.no,,,Research Council of Norway [287563],Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway),The research was funded by the Research Council of Norway (grant number 287563).,,70,0,0,1,1,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1083-6101,,,J COMPUT-MEDIAT COMM,J.

These manipulated videos are called deepfakes. In this article, a theoretical model on the detection of deepfakes by ordinary citizens is introduced. The authors conducted three studies in which deepfakes with political content were presented. The deepfakes showed UK's Prime Minister Boris Johnson or Barack Obama. In the deepfake videos, the two politicians said things they had never said in real life. The authors expected that people who regularly and automatically reflect on information they see (analytic thinking) are more likely to identify deepfakes correctly than people who tend to be less reflective, more intuitive. The authors further expected that interest in politics is positively related to detecting political deepfakes. Indeed, the higher participants' scores on analytic thinking (Studies 1-2) and political interest (Study 1), the better participants identified the deepfakes. Moreover, people with high analytic thinking and political interest were better at identifying a fake news article to be inaccurate (whether or not a warranting deepfake video was presented, Study 3). It is discussed how researchers, everyday people, and whole societies can deal with deepfakes. Deepfake technology, allowing manipulations of audiovisual content by means of artificial intelligence, is on the rise. This has sparked concerns about a weaponization of manipulated videos for malicious ends. A theory on deepfake detection is presented and three preregistered studies examined the detection of deepfakes in the political realm (featuring UK's Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Studies 1-3, or former U.S. President Barack Obama, Study 2). Based on two system models of information processing as well as recent theory and research on fake news, individual differences in analytic thinking and political interest were examined as predictors of correctly detecting deepfakes. Analytic thinking (Studies 1 and 2) and political interest (Study 1) were positively associated with identifying deepfakes and negatively associated with the perceived accuracy of a fake news piece about a leaked video (whether or not the deepfake video itself was presented, Study 3). Implications for research and practice are discussed.","[Appel, Markus; Prietzel, Fabian] Julius Maximilians Univ Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany",University of Wurzburg,"Appel, M (corresponding author), Julius Maximilians Univ Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.",markus.appel@uni-wuerzburg.de,,"Appel, Markus/0000-0003-4111-1308",,,,,79,0,0,19,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1083-6101,,,J COMPUT-MEDIAT COMM,J.

Portraying oneself in an authentic manner, however, is complicated by the phenomenon of context collapse, where multiple audiences (e.g., friends, teachers, parents) become homogenized and boundaries become blurred. Drawing on focus group data with 20 teenagers aged 13-17, we examined how teens use Finstas (fake Instagram accounts) to navigate tensions between context collapse and authenticity. Our participants see themselves as quite skilled at creating idealized identities on their Rinstas (real Instagram accounts) but turn to Finstas because they find such performances unsatisfying, using these secondary accounts for active resistance to norms of mainstream Instagram, often through negative emotional expression and self-description. Our study adds to the literature on teen social media use by illuminating strategies teens use to navigate context collapse as they seek authenticity. Lay Summary Many teenagers use multiple social media accounts, including what they call Finstas, or fake Instagram accounts. We interviewed 20 teenagers between 13 and 17 years old about their use of Finstas to find out how they present themselves online. Our participants told us they feel free to be more authentic on their Finstas, which ironically makes their fake accounts more real than their main Instagram accounts. They are very thoughtful about the fact that their main accounts can be seen by multiple audiences such as teachers, parents, and strangers, and describe using their Finstas for fun and for expressing their honest feelings with their friends. They find posting on their main accounts to be unsatisfying and phony, so they turn to Finstas as a way to be more real with their friends, often by sharing negative emotions and being critical of themselves. In doing so, they create alternative norms of behavior like using humor and spontaneity and judge each other based on those norms. Our study helps us to understand how and why teenagers use multiple accounts to express what they see as authentic versions of themselves.","[Darr, Christopher R.; Doss, Erin F.] Indiana Univ, Dept Commun & Performing Arts, Kokomo, IN 46904 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Kokomo,"Darr, CR (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, 2300 S Washington St, Kokomo, IN 46904 USA.",darrc@iuk.edu,,,,,,,45,0,0,18,18,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1083-6101,,,J COMPUT-MEDIAT COMM,J.

Using the same sampling procedures and codebook, we coded 765 primetime television programs and movies airing on 21 broadcast and cable networks. Results suggest the prevalence of violence has increased slightly, but the number of programs saturated with violence has experienced a more significant increase. This appears to be driven by an influx of highly violent movies airing in primetime on cable channels. Although some contextual variables suggest slight improvements in terms of negative consequences for violence, the overwhelming majority of violent television programs and movies do not feature anti-violence themes.

Using a representative sample of social media users (n = 968), we conducted two 2 x 2 between-subjects experiments focusing on two political issues and individuals' political ideology as a quasi-factor. The first factor manipulated who shared the misinformation (politically similar vs. dissimilar friend); the second manipulated the misinformation's plausibility (implausible vs. moderately plausible). Our findings, which replicated across political issues and levels of plausibility, reveal that social media users, particularly left-wing users, are more likely to block and unfollow politically dissimilar than similar friends who share misinformation.

Results were inconsistent with the confounding approach but consistent with the hypothesis that individual differences predict cognitive response states that increase or decrease the likelihood of media effects.","[Wright, Paul J.; Paul, Bryant] Indiana Univ, Media Sch, Commun Sci Unit, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Tokunaga, Robert S.] Univ Texas San Antonio, Dept Commun, San Antonio, TX USA; [Herbenick, Debby] Indiana Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Ctr Sexual Hlth Promot, Bloomington, IN USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; University of Texas System; University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA); Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Wright, PJ (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Media Sch, Commun Sci Unit, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",paulwrig@indiana.edu,,,,,,,86,2,2,3,6,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0021-9916,1460-2466,,J COMMUN,J.

This bias not only shapes social perceptions of knowledge, but it can also propagate beyond the platform as its contents are leveraged to correct misinformation, train machine-learning tools, and enhance search engine results. What happens when feminist movements intervene to try to close existing gaps? Through a quantitative analysis of over 11,000 Wikipedia articles, we provide an evaluation of two popular feminist interventions designed to counteract gender inequality within digital information projects. We find that the interventions are successful at adding content about women that would otherwise be missing, but they are less successful at addressing structural biases that limit the visibility of that content. This leads us to argue for a more granular and cumulative analysis of gender gaps in collaborative environments. We also discuss the implications for future scholarship on digital inequalities.","[Langrock, Isabelle; Gonzalez-Bailon, Sandra] Univ Penn, Annenberg Sch Commun, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania,"Gonzalez-Bailon, S (corresponding author), Univ Penn, Annenberg Sch Commun, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",sgonzalezbailon@asc.upenn.edu,,,,,,,63,0,0,9,17,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0021-9916,1460-2466,,J COMMUN,J.

In today's high-choice media environments, exposure to diverse news is largely determined by individuals' personal selection. Yet these decisions are increasingly shaped by online platforms, whose curation mechanisms may serve to expand or contract the diversity of encountered content. In a major extension of existing research, we show that positive short-term effects of platforms mask detrimental long-term effects. Drawing on a four-month tracking dataset and a comprehensive content analysis covering the online news consumption of over 10,000 German citizens, we demonstrate that even though short-term usage of platforms uniformly increases exposure diversity, long-term reliance can lead to decreases. In addition, platforms vary in their influences: News aggregators are beneficial to exposure diversity, while Twitter and search engines have a limiting effect; Facebook offers no significant influence.","[Juergens, Pascal; Stark, Birgit] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Dept Commun, Jakob Welder Weg 12, D-55099 Mainz, Rhineland Palat, Germany",Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz,"Jurgens, P (corresponding author), Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Dept Commun, Jakob Welder Weg 12, D-55099 Mainz, Rhineland Palat, Germany.",pascal.juergens@uni-mainz.de,,"Jurgens, Pascal/0000-0002-6810-0011",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) [STA1437/3-1],Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),This project was funded by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) through grant STA1437/3-1.,,57,4,4,9,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0021-9916,1460-2466,,J COMMUN,J.

Considering this form of investigation as an emerging network for the hybrid institution of journalism, an assemblage extending beyond the newsroom, this study takes a mixed-method, networked ethnography approach to map out this open-source space. Using a network analysis of open-source investigators based on Twitter data shows that the recently emerged Bellingcat organization and similar open-source groups serve a liaison function, bridging professional journalists and largely anonymous citizen sleuthers. Using this network as a guide, depth interviews were conducted with key participants, showing that the community was organized around an accountability ethos and a methodology of verification. We argue that this interlocking network has potential to strengthen the resilience of the journalistic institution, build citizen trust and resist politicized historical revisionism.","[Reese, Stephen D.; Chen, Bin] Univ Texas Austin, Sch Journalism & Media, Austin, TX 78712 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Reese, SD (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, Sch Journalism & Media, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",Steve.reese@utexas.edu,,,,,,,32,0,0,4,4,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0021-9916,1460-2466,,J COMMUN,J.

Using a conjoint experiment, we randomly assigned participants (N = 1,489) to receive an experimentally manipulated message describing an allegation of political misconduct. Results suggest that partisan cues play a significant role in influencing both belief and perceived credibility. Furthermore, message specificity, language intensity, and whether other users' comments on the post refute or endorse the post also influenced belief judgment and credibility assessments.

Daily e-cigarette users in the dogmatic anti-vaping PSA condition also had greater defensive motivational reactivity during message exposure as indicated by greater corrugator muscle activation, skin conductivity levels, and less heart rate deceleration than daily e-cigarette users in the suggestive anti-vaping PSA condition.

The findings suggest that such exposure can indirectly polarize attitude by eliciting passive scanning behaviors, but it can also indirectly attenuate attitude polarization first through active engagement with the counter-attitudinal information, then through cognitively elaborating on the information. However, the indirect depolarizing effect of incidental exposure to counter-attitudinal information on citizens' attitude depends on the extent to which they are instrumentally motivated. The indirect effect occurs when an individual's perceived utility of counter-attitudinal information is at a high and a middle level, but not at a low level.

Accordingly, I construct a performance-derived measure of true overconfidence. I find domain-involvement correlates of TPP tend not to hold for actual overconfidence. I also find significant differences in potential behavioral outcomes suggesting the traditional measure may often reflect genuine differences in self and others' susceptibility to media, rather than a self-serving bias of presumed invulnerability. These results have important implications for our understanding and measurement of perceptual biases in communication research.","[Lyons, Benjamin A.] Univ Utah, Dept Commun, 255 Cent Campus Dr, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Lyons, Benjamin A.] Univ Exeter, Dept Polit, Amory Bldg, Exeter EX4 4RJ, Devon, England",Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah; University of Exeter,"Lyons, BA (corresponding author), Univ Utah, Dept Commun, 255 Cent Campus Dr, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.",ben.lyons@utah.edu,"Lyons, Ben/J-5323-2019","Lyons, Ben/0000-0001-7096-900X","European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union [682758]; Nelson A.

Scholars argue that broadening representations of gamers is necessary to normalizing women's presence in esports. As nongaming organizations enter the space, they have a unique opportunity to disrupt established norms through their representations of esports competitors. This study analyzes the representation of U.S. Army Esports (USAE) team members via official social media channels. USAE was created as a public relations tool to engage with a younger audience, redefine the public image of the Army, and recruit soldiers. Using a critical public relations framework and critical discourse analysis, we examine the discourse around gender and esports constructed through USAE's representation of team members and the role of public relations practice in reinforcing or disrupting existing norms.","[Fisher, Jolene; Foust, Joshua] Univ Colorado, Dept Advertising Publ Relat & Media Design, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Fisher, J (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Dept Advertising Publ Relat & Media Design, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",jolene.fisher@colorado.edu,,"Foust, Joshua/0000-0003-3511-4641",,,,,77,0,0,9,22,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0021-9916,1460-2466,,J COMMUN,J.

Following this definition, we track the republication and reframing, over nearly 70 years, of 15 news photographs previously identified as most recognized by the Israeli public. Distinguishing between discrete icons (singular photographs of particular scenes) and aggregate icons (where several variants of the same event are continually reproduced), our quantitative and qualitative analyses show that iconic images are both resistant to the passing of time and kept in motion through renewed media use. We identify four iconic modalities, corresponding to different ways in which iconic status and meanings are achieved, transformed, or denied through republishing and reframing. This concept improves our understanding of iconicity as a fluctuating material and symbolic process, whereby the circulation of images not only produces shifts in meaning, but constructs powerful aggregative frameworks of collective visual memory.","[Boudana, Sandrine; Cohen, Akiba A.] Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Commun, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Frosh, Paul] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Commun & Journalism, Jerusalem, Israel",Tel Aviv University; Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"Boudana, S (corresponding author), Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Commun, Tel Aviv, Israel.",boudanasandrine@gmail.com,,,Israel Science Foundation (ISF) [436-17],Israel Science Foundation (ISF)(Israel Science Foundation),Grant from the Israel Science Foundation (ISF) #436-17.,,48,0,0,2,2,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0021-9916,1460-2466,,J COMMUN,J.

Iterative processes between formal and informal structures expanded capacity, building a foundation for work processes to scaffold from individual to organizational to interorganizational networks. Yet some employees were personally vulnerable, revealing a multilevel dilemma: organizations were resilient even if employees were not. This study also theorizes time as an endogenous mechanism. As workers perceived less urgency, process experts broadened communication across levels, integrating more complex work processes. Resilience differed between organizations that lacked process experts, revealing their critical role across levels. Findings point to a policy-making dilemma: successful resilience processes undermine pressure on policy-makers to mitigate threats that necessitate improving resilience processes to begin with.","[Doerfel, Marya L.; Kwestel, Melanie; Quow, Justine] Rutgers State Univ, Sch Commun & Informat, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA; [Kim, Minkyung] Univ Illinois, Dept Commun, Urbana, IL USA; [Yoon, Hyunsook] Calif State Univ Channel Isl, Dept Commun, Camarillo, CA USA",Rutgers State University New Brunswick; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; California State University System; California State University Channel Islands,"Doerfel, ML (corresponding author), Rutgers State Univ, Sch Commun & Informat, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA.",mdoerfel@rutgers.edu,,,National Science Foundation [1760512],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This article is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under award number 1760512.

Likewise, NFM's news over-reliance on one's social network support the development of homogeneous information and discussion political networks in social media (political homophily). Results based on a variety of ordinary least squares regression models (cross-sectional, lagged, and autoregressive) from a U.S. representative panel survey, as we all as autoregressive structural equation model tests, indicate that this is indeed the case.

Flow experiences are highly rewarding and are associated with well-being. Importantly, media use can be a source of flow. Communication scholars have a long history of theoretical inquiry into how flow biases media selection, how different media content results in flow, and how flow influences media processing and effects. However, the neurobiological basis of flow during media use is not well understood, limiting our explanatory capacity to specify how media contribute to flow or well-being. Here, we show that flow is associated with a flexible and modular brain-network topology, which may offer an explanation for why flow is simultaneously perceived as high-control and effortless, even when the task difficulty is high. Our study tests core predictions derived from synchronization theory, and our results provide qualified support for the theory while also suggesting important theoretical updates.","[Huskey, Richard; Gong, Xuanjun (Jason)] Univ Calif Davis, Cognit Commun Sci Lab, Dept Commun, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Huskey, Richard] Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Mind & Brain, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Keene, Justin Robert; Najera, Christina J.] Texas Tech Univ, Cognit & Emot Lab, Coll Media & Commun, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA; [Wilcox, Shelby] Michigan State Univ, Neurosci Messages Lab, Dept Commun, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Adams, Robyn] Michigan State Univ, Dept Advertising & Publ Relat, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Najera, Christina J.] Univ Tennessee, Sch Advertising & Publ Relat, Knoxville, TN USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; University of California System; University of California Davis; Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University; Michigan State University; Michigan State University; University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville,"Huskey, R (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Cognit Commun Sci Lab, Dept Commun, Davis, CA 95616 USA.;Huskey, R (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Mind & Brain, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",rwhuskey@ucdavis.edu,"Huskey, Richard/H-9286-2019","Huskey, Richard/0000-0002-4559-2439; Wilcox, Shelby/0000-0002-0013-1612; Keene, Justin/0000-0002-1404-0025",Ohio State University School of Communication Miller Research Award,Ohio State University School of Communication Miller Research Award,This work was supported by The Ohio State University School of Communication Miller Research Award.,,81,0,0,11,17,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0021-9916,1460-2466,,J COMMUN,J.

Yet limited research has explored how actors perceive these paradoxes and manage resulting tensions in a politically repressive context. Ubiquitous government oversight, information control, and Internet censorship may uniquely complicate paradoxes of visibility in non-Western environments. To address this gap, this research reconsiders the paradox(es) of visibility in politically restrictive contexts. Interview data from 50 social entrepreneurs and two field experts in China reveal the antecedents to visibility paradoxes, and suggest three novel forms of paradoxes: resource investment, public attention, and social change. We also show these paradoxes are interdependent such that one may be amplified or attenuated by the other paradoxes. Further, we identify three strategies for responding to these paradoxes and suggest implications for vulnerable actors in maintaining a public profile, especially in sensitive sociopolitical environments.","[Fu, Jiawei Sophia] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Commun, Sch Commun & Informat, 4 Huntington St, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA; [Cooper, Katherine R.] DePaul Univ, Coll Commun, Chicago, IL USA",Rutgers State University New Brunswick; DePaul University,"Fu, JS (corresponding author), Rutgers State Univ, Dept Commun, Sch Commun & Informat, 4 Huntington St, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA.",sophia.fu@rutgers.edu,,,National Science Foundation [SES-1730079]; Buffet Institute for Global Studies at Northwestern University; Rutgers University School of Communication and Information,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Buffet Institute for Global Studies at Northwestern University; Rutgers University School of Communication and Information,"This research was generously supported by the National Science Foundation (SES-1730079), Buffet Institute for Global Studies at Northwestern University, and the faculty start-up funding from the Rutgers University School of Communication and Information.",,46,0,0,15,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0021-9916,1460-2466,,J COMMUN,J.

These effects shrink substantially but remain significant for panel studies. While we found a stronger relationship with knowledge for experiments compared to surveys, the relationship between IE and discussion and participation was not significant for experiments. Overall, findings suggest that IE matters, but its effects are smaller and more nuanced than previously thought.

This survey experiment (N = 1,330) shows that disinformation accusations reduce audience members' trust in the accused news outlet and perceived accuracy of the news message, while trust in the accusing politician is largely unaffected. However, only individuals with strong populist attitudes generalize disinformation accusations to the media as an institution and reduce their general media trust.

This inequality often follows patterns consistent with cumulative advantage, a process in which performance compounds over time. Attention to news sources online possesses these characteristics; however, online audiences also fragment across many disparate news producers. How do social media and recommender systems contribute to these attention dynamics? In this study, we examine two paradigmatic models: concentration driven by cumulative advantage and fragmentation driven by stochasticity. We evaluate these models against a large-scale empirical dataset of news source attention in the popular social media site Reddit. While we find high levels of attention concentration, we do not find the stable popularity over time that characterizes cumulative advantage. Rather, sources gain and lose popularity seemingly at random, aligning with a stochastic model. These results demonstrate the persistence of attention inequality, even in the absence of a strong driving mechanism. They also suggest that social media systems can undermine the accumulation of attention to the most prominent news sources. Digital attention markets striving for more equitable allocation require novel mechanisms of organizing and distributing information.","[Hagar, Nick; Shaw, Aaron] Northwestern Univ, Commun Studies, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Northwestern University,"Hagar, N (corresponding author), Northwestern Univ, Commun Studies, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",nhagar@u.northwestern.edu,,,,,,,53,0,0,8,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0021-9916,1460-2466,,J COMMUN,J.

Results show that partisans share more content than nonpartisans and that their preferences differ from those of nonpartisans. Our findings show that a network of peers with cross-cutting ideological preferences may be perceived as a bubble if partisans amplify content they like at higher rates. Beginning with fully randomized probabilities, the output from our experiments is more extreme than the preferences of the median users, as partisans activate more and different frame elements than nonpartisans.

However, it is currently unclear whether using these platforms actually makes them more politically knowledgeable. While some researchers claim that social media play a critical role in the learning of political information within the modern media environment, others posit that the great potential for learning about politics on social media is rarely fulfilled. The current study tests which of these conflicting theoretical claims is supported by the existing empirical literature. A preregistered meta-analysis of 76 studies (N = 442,136) reveals no evidence of any political learning on social media in observational studies, and statistically significant but substantively small increases in knowledge in experiments. These small-to-nonexistent knowledge gains are observed across social media platforms, types of knowledge, countries, and periods.

Both studies found that memory recall was more common in response to older (vs. recent) entertainment, and the memories activated by older entertainment were happier and produced more temporal comparisons. Although appreciation was higher for older entertainment in Study 1, this effect did not replicate in Study 2. However, both studies found that appreciation was higher for content that activated memories, especially memories that were more emotional and immersive. These patterns emerged regardless of when the content was released. These findings clarify why audiences sometimes perceive meaning in lighthearted entertainment, such as pop music or superhero films.","[Bonus, James Alex; Francemone, C.

This study employs an ecological approach to explicate interissue relationships. It quantifies the nature and evolution of the issue ecosystem and examines the roles of the value orientations of issues and of individuals' education levels and political partisanship in interissue relationships. The study compiled and analyzed the Gallup Most Important Problem polls in the United States from 1958 to 2020. The findings indicate that the issue ecosystem of the American public is essentially competitive and that the balance of competition and cooperation has remained unchanged over time.

Prior research has focused more on the former than the latter. The current research considers how outcome uncertainty predicts a global evaluation of enjoyment for competitions in which the personal stakes associated with the outcome are relatively low. Using moment-to-moment (MTM) measures of suspense, we find that competitions with more (vs. less) outcome uncertainty positively predict both total suspense and a set of key features aggregated from MTM suspense (slope, end, peak, and time-to-peak). A global evaluation of enjoyment was also predicted by these same measures. Further, enjoyment in each experiment was more highly correlated with peak suspense than it was with total suspense. Our contribution therefore is a nuanced description of how certain key features of suspenseful competitions with low-stakes outcomes influence a global evaluation of enjoyment.","[Madrigal, Robert] Calif State Univ, 449 Tehama Hall, Chico, CA 95929 USA; [Bee, Colleen; Chen, Johnny] Oregon State Univ, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA",Oregon State University,"Madrigal, R (corresponding author), Calif State Univ, 449 Tehama Hall, Chico, CA 95929 USA.",rmadrigal@csuchico.edu,,"Madrigal, Robert/0000-0002-5175-1299",,,,,45,0,0,0,2,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0093-6502,1552-3810,,COMMUN RES,Commun.

Beyond diverse connections, research also shows individuals must be familiar with their collaborators' areas of expertise to effectively integrate knowledge. Despite growing recognition of the importance of familiarity for interdisciplinary collaboration, we argue that there is reason to suspect this form of relationship is likely to be particularly rare in organizations. We present an egocentric analysis of collaboration networks in a scientific organization, exploring factors associated with the copresence of interdisciplinary ties alongside familiarity with a collaborator's area of expertise. Our results demonstrate pressures toward similarity of expertise that minimized connections to differing alters. Furthermore, those respondents who had diverse connections tended to be unfamiliar with their distant collaborators' domains. Interaction counteracted this effect but participants reported pressures inhibiting interaction across knowledge boundaries.

As personality variables, rational and intuitive privacy decision-making styles and privacy resignation were assessed. Results of a within-between random effects model showed that benefit perceptions were positively associated with self-disclosure intentions on between- and within-person levels. The privacy score was found to be effective in supporting users to make more privacy aware choices (within-person level). Finally, the rational decision-making style was positively related to privacy risk perception, while especially intuitive decision-makers can benefit from decision-making aids like the privacy score.","[Meier, Yannic] Univ Duisburg Essen, Team Social Psychol Media & Commun, Duisburg, Germany; [Kraemer, Nicole C.] Univ Duisburg Essen, Social Psychol Media & Commun, Forsthausweg 2, D-47057 Duisburg, Germany",University of Duisburg Essen; University of Duisburg Essen,"Meier, Y (corresponding author), Univ Duisburg Essen, Social Psychol Media & Commun, Forsthausweg 2, D-47057 Duisburg, Germany.",yannic.meier@uni-due.de,,"Meier, Yannic/0000-0002-5726-3229",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research [16KIS0743],German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work has been funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Funding number: 16KIS0743).",,36,1,1,11,11,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0093-6502,1552-3810,,COMMUN RES,Commun.

We introduce a new concept called screenertia and use new screen-capture methodology to empirically evaluate its occurrence. We unobtrusively obtained 400,000+ screenshots of 30 participants' laptop screens every 5 seconds for 4 days to examine individuals' attention to their screens and how the distribution of attention differs across media content. All individuals' screen segments were best described by a log-normal survival function-evidence of screenertia. Consistent with the literature on uses and gratifications of media, news/entertainment activities were the most sticky. These findings indicate that screenertia is not only related to the level of interactivity of media content but is also related to its modality and agency. Discussion of the findings highlights the importance of theorizing, examining, and modeling the specific time scales at which media behaviors manifest and evolve.","[Brinberg, Miriam; Sundar, S.

People with high negative relations with others also tended to have lower perceptions of affective well-being and relational connection, and greater perceptions of stress-related cognition, during moments of social interaction. Yet, results also indicated that while positive communication appears harder to come by for people with high negative relations with others, these individuals gain outsized benefits from positive interaction when it occurs (e.g., sharper increases in well-being and decreases in stress). This suggests that heightened negative relations with others might lead people to hyperabsorb the benefits of positive moments of communication. The results have implications for key perspectives on communication, relational life, and well-being (i.e., affection deprivation, appraisal, implicit vigilance, and resource insufficiency) and suggest potential routes for intervention development for people with difficult relational lives.","[Merolla, Andy J.; Hansia, Afsoon] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Commun, 4415 SSMS Bldg, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Hall, Jeffrey A.] Univ Kansas, Dept Commun Studies, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Zhang, Shuangyue] Sam Houston State Univ, Dept Commun Studies, Huntsville, TX 77340 USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; University of Kansas; Texas State University System; Sam Houston State University,"Merolla, AJ (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Commun, 4415 SSMS Bldg, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",amerolla@comm.ucsb.edu,,,"Academic Senate Grant from the University of California, Santa Barbara","Academic Senate Grant from the University of California, Santa Barbara(University of California System)","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study was funded by an Academic Senate Grant from the University of California, Santa Barbara awarded to the first author.",,45,2,2,4,14,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0093-6502,1552-3810,,COMMUN RES,Commun.

The analyses were based on longitudinal network data from 13 residential student communities. The study found evidence consistent with social contagion. The political knowledge of participants was predicted by the knowledge of their strong social ties. Political discussants were not as influential as high-frequency general conversation partners.

Drawing on social identity and intergroup theories, this study employs computational methods to explore to what extent political discussions on Reddit's r/politics are affectively polarized, and what communicative factors shape these affective biases. Results show that interactions between ideologically opposed users were significantly more negative than like-minded ones. These interactions were also more likely to be cut short than sustained if one user referred negatively to the other's political in-group. Conversely, crosscutting interactions in which one of the users expressed positive sentiment toward the out-group were more likely to attract a positive than a negative response, thus mitigating intergroup affective bias.

Study 2 (N = 1,022) replicated these results and observed a deception consensus effect reported in other studies: the more that people deceived, the more they believed that others deceived as well.

In this study, a polytomous latent class analysis of their opinions regarding party-divided issues identifies several types of voters and highlights the distinction between active and passive ambivalent voters. Such a distinction is necessary to clarify the relationship between party ambivalence and political participation. Drawing on research into ambivalent attitudes, the current study postulates that active ambivalent citizens adopt amplification strategies, whereas passive ambivalent citizens adopt avoidance strategies. A comparison between them further indicates that active ambivalent citizens are motivated to fulfill their civic duties and be accountable when they seek political information, and they express more political interest than their passive counterparts. A three-wave panel survey confirms the influence of ambivalent voter types (wave 1) on political participation (wave 3), according to voters' political orientation (i.e., civic duty motives to seek political information and interest in politics) and their interactive political communication (interactive engagement with digital political information and interpersonal political discussions) (wave 2).","[Chang, Chingching] Acad Sinica, Res Ctr Humanities & Social Sci, 128 Acad Sinica Rd,Sect 2, Taipei 11529, Taiwan; [Wu, Chung-li] Acad Sinica, Inst Polit Sci, Taipei, Taiwan",Academia Sinica - Taiwan; Academia Sinica - Taiwan,"Chang, CC (corresponding author), Acad Sinica, Res Ctr Humanities & Social Sci, 128 Acad Sinica Rd,Sect 2, Taipei 11529, Taiwan.",chingching.chang@gmail.com,"Chang, Chingching/AAY-4961-2021","CHANG, CHINGCHING/0000-0003-0551-3190",,,,,80,0,0,5,9,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0093-6502,1552-3810,,COMMUN RES,Commun.

Although authors have increasingly used stylistic cues in academic titles, articles with titles containing such cues were cited less frequently. Journal impact modified this relationship: The presence of a stylistic title was associated with more citations if the article was published in a lower impact journal, but fewer citations if it was published in a higher impact journal.

We also observed evidence of goal contagion, as inferences about a partner's goals mediated several associations between the partner's previous goals and individuals' subsequent goals. Furthermore, inferences about partners' goals also mediated associations between individuals' own prior goals and their goals at the next minute.","[Worley, Timothy; Vanderbilt, Rachel] Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Liu, Esther] Wheaton Coll, Wheaton, IL 60187 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Wheaton College,"Worley, T (corresponding author), Univ North Alabama, Dept Commun, 123C Commun Bldg, Florence, AL 35632 USA.",tworley1@una.edu,,,,,,,64,0,0,1,1,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0093-6502,1552-3810,,COMMUN RES,Commun.

The present study employed communication privacy management (CPM) theory to examine adoptive parents' (N = 354) private disclosures with the birth family across in-person and mediated (i.e., texting and social media) contexts. SEM analysis revealed that adoptive families who were more private and were concerned about the birth family sharing private information with others viewed disclosures to the birth family as risky. These privacy concerns related to adoptive parents being more clear with the birth family about preferences for sharing that private information with others. More social media contact between birth and adoptive parents predicted increased perceptions of risk of disclosure to birth parents. Results advance CPM theorizing by underscoring the motivational bases of perceived risk, the importance of anticipated boundary turbulence, and the nuanced privacy management processes within communication modes.","[Colaner, Colleen Warner; Horstman, Haley Kranstuber] Univ Missouri, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Bish, Alyssa L.] Missouri Dept Social Serv, Jefferson City, MO USA; [Butauski, Maria] Columbia Coll, Columbia, MO USA; [Hays, Alexie] Univ Colorado, Colorado Springs, CO 80907 USA; [Nelson, Leslie R.] Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado at Colorado Springs; California State University System; California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo,"Colaner, CW (corresponding author), Univ Missouri, Dept Commun, 114 Switzler Hall, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",colanerc@missouri.edu,"Colaner, Colleen/E-7773-2015","Colaner, Colleen/0000-0002-3742-4646",University of Missouri Research Council,University of Missouri Research Council,"The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study was supported with funding from the University of Missouri Research Council.",,38,0,0,4,13,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0093-6502,1552-3810,,COMMUN RES,Commun.

The attractiveness of the profile picture was varied systematically, and texts either included language errors or not. By collecting eye tracking and perception data, we investigated whether picture attractiveness determines attention to the profile text and if the text plays a secondary role. Eye tracking results revealed that pictures are more likely to attract initial attention and that more attractive pictures receive more attention. Texts received attention regardless of the picture's attractiveness. Moreover, perception data showed that both the pictorial and textual cues affect impression formation, but that they affect different dimensions of perceived attraction differently. Based on our results, a new multimodal information processing model is proposed, which suggests that pictures and texts are processed independently and lead to separate assessments of cue attractiveness before impression formation.","[van der Zanden, Tess; Mos, Maria B.

Using the theoretical foundation of hostile media perceptions, with a specific focus on relative hostile media, we examine whether interpersonal communication affects perceived credibility of liberal and conservative media outlets and whether these effects translate into increased use or avoidance of partisan media outlets. Using data collected during the 2016 U.S. election, we find that supportive interpersonal discussion is associated with greater perceived credibility of liberal media outlets (e.g., MSNBC) among liberals, which results in increased use of liberal leaning news outlets. In addition, we find that discussion with those who hold opposing views is associated with increased perceived credibility of conservative media outlets (e.g., Fox News) among conservatives, which translates into greater use of conservative leaning outlets. Similarly, talking to those who hold opposing views decreases perceived credibility of liberal media outlets (e.g., MSNBC) among conservatives, resulting in decreased use of liberal leaning outlets.","[Hmielowski, Jay D.; Hutchens, Myiah J.] Univ Florida, Coll Journalism & Commun, Dept Publ Relat, Gainesville, FL USA; [Staggs, Sarah] TaylorMade Golf Co Inc, Carlsbad, CA USA; [Beam, Michael A.] Kent State Univ, Kent, OH 44242 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; University System of Ohio; Kent State University; Kent State University Kent; Kent State University Salem,"Hmielowski, JD (corresponding author), Univ Florida, POB 118400, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",jhmielowski@ufl.edu,"Hutchens, Myiah J/AAP-3450-2020","Hutchens, Myiah J/0000-0002-5424-7012",,,,,53,8,8,1,13,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0093-6502,1552-3810,,COMMUN RES,Commun.

This study considers how the strength of ties and multiplex relationships among organizations may reveal a more complex explanation for why networks take on certain structures. Our results challenge some long held assumptions about the mechanisms that influence network formation. For instance, our results offer important insights into the consequences of closure mechanisms, the applicability of preferential attachment to real-world networks, and the nuances of homophily in network formation on multidimensional relationships in a communication network.

Brokers are often thought of as exhibiting atertius gaudensorientation toward their network position through their efforts to keep disconnected groups apart, thereby maintaining their ability to control the flow of information between the groups. However, brokers may also exhibit atertius iungensorientation if they make decisions to join disconnected groups together, bridging structural holes and enabling information to flow freely between them. Drawing on data from an in-depth field study, this article shows that when brokers identify with their community of practice or their profession, they are more likely to exhibit atertius iungensorientation than when brokers identify with personal or workgroup targets. The qualitative data suggest that this relationship between identification with targets and brokerage orientation was guided by the rules and resources of the identities they enacted. The targets with which brokers identified shaped how they took perspectives in their work and the flexibility with which they enacted their role, which in turn shaped their decisions about whether to join people together or to keep them apart.","[Endacott, Camille G.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Commun, 4408 Social Sci & Media Studies Bldg, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Leonardi, Paul M.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Technol Management, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara,"Endacott, CG (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Commun, 4408 Social Sci & Media Studies Bldg, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",Camille_endacott@ucsb.edu,,"Endacott, Camille/0000-0002-4938-0919",,,,,48,0,0,0,7,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0093-6502,1552-3810,,COMMUN RES,Commun.

Previous theory and studies have inconsistent arguments and evidence regarding cultural diversity's effects on team performance. We recognize that member cultural diversity is one possible influence on the variety and meanings of messages generated within groups, and the messages' meanings may then affect performance. Work-related information sharing, including information sharing openness and uniqueness, is proposed as an underlying mechanism that translates the effect of cultural diversity to project team performance. Additionally, team cultural intelligence may moderate the relationship between cultural diversity and the information sharing processes. Participants constituted three types of teams: all American (N = 32 teams), all Chinese (N = 34 teams), and mixed (N = 38 teams), in which team members finished a business problem identification task collectively. Results showed that in culturally diverse teams, high levels of cultural intelligence amplified the positive relationship between cultural diversity and information sharing uniqueness, which in turn led to higher team performance.

Here, we assess how this norm information affected norm perceptions over time by pairing these data with a rolling cross-sectional survey of young people's beliefs and intentions related to these behaviors. We found that individual use depictions predicted some norm perceptions, although the direction of effects varied depending on the source, behavior, and type of perceptions considered.

It compares user comments on the public role of religion and secularism from 2015/16 in four democracies (Australia, United States, Germany, Switzerland) and four discussion arenas on three platforms (News websites, Facebook, Twitter). A novel automated content analysis (N = 1,236,551) combines LIWC dictionaries with machine learning. The level of toxic outrage is higher in majoritarian than in consensus-oriented democracies and in arenas that afford plural, issue-driven rather than like-minded, preference-driven debates. Yet, toxic outrage is lower in forums that tend to separate public and private conversations than in those that collapse varying contexts. This suggests that user-generated discussions flourish in environments that incentivize actors to strive for compromise, put relevant issues center stage and make room for public debate at a relative distance from purely social conversation.","[Jakob, Julia; Dobbrick, Timo; Freudenthaler, Rainer; Wessler, Hartmut] Univ Mannheim, Baden Wurttemberg, Germany; [Haffner, Patrik] Forum Inst Management GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany",University of Mannheim,"Jakob, J (corresponding author), Univ Mannheim, Mannheim Ctr European Social Res, A5,6 Bldg A, D-68159 Mannheim, Baden Wurttembe, Germany.",julia.jakob@mzes.uni-mannheim.de,,"Jakob, Julia/0000-0003-2340-5193; Wessler, Hartmut/0000-0003-4216-5471","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) [260291564]","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation)(German Research Foundation (DFG))","The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) under grant number 260291564.",,73,0,0,5,9,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0093-6502,1552-3810,,COMMUN RES,Commun.

We compared satirical news to two reference categories: (1) control messages with no or irrelevant information, and (2) regular news with similar informational content. Results demonstrate that satirical (vs. regular) news increased positive affective responses and message discounting. By contrast, satire increased learning compared to control messages, but not compared to regular news. We find limited evidence for a positive main effect of satire on persuasion. However, we find different moderating effects, indicating that persuasion effects are stronger for Republicans (vs. other voters), student (vs. general-population) samples, TV satire (vs. online and print satire), and for satire targeting social actors.","[Burgers, Christian; Brugman, Britta C.] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Commun Sci, Boelelaan 1081, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Burgers, Christian] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; University of Amsterdam,"Burgers, C (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Commun Sci, Boelelaan 1081, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",c.f.burgers@vu.nl,"Burgers, Christian/C-6093-2011","Burgers, Christian/0000-0002-5652-9021; Brugman, Britta/0000-0002-0064-5154",Dutch Research Council (NWO) [276-45005],Dutch Research Council (NWO)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)),"The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work is part of the research program Contemporary Political Satire: Medium, Language, and Impact of Satiric News with project number 276-45005, which is financed by the Dutch Research Council (NWO).",,87,4,4,5,33,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0093-6502,1552-3810,,COMMUN RES,Commun.

When reporting, journalists have to select, accentuate, or exclude particular aspects, which, in turn, may evoke a specific, and possibly constricted, perspective in viewers, a phenomenon termed the news-framing effect. Guided by the reinforcing spiral framework, we conducted a multi-study project that investigated the news-framing effect's underlying mechanism by studying the dynamic of self-reinforcing effects. Grounded in a real-life framing environment observed during the pandemic and systematically assessed via a content analysis (study 1) and survey (study 2), we offer supporting evidence for a preference-based reinforcement model by utilizing a combination of the selective exposure (i.e., self-selected exposure) and causal effects (i.e., forced exposure) paradigms within one randomized controlled study (study 3). Self-selection of news content by viewers was a necessary precondition for frame-consistent (reinforcement) effects. Forced exposure did not elicit causal effects in a frame-consistent direction.","[Arendt, Florian] Univ Vienna, Dept Commun, Tenure track professorship Hlth Commun, Vienna, Austria; [Forrai, Michaela; Mestas, Manina] Univ Vienna, Dept Commun, Wahringer Str 29, A-1090 Vienna, Austria",University of Vienna; University of Vienna,"Arendt, F (corresponding author), Univ Vienna, Dept Commun, Wahringer Str 29, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.",florian.arendt@univie.ac.at,,"Arendt, Florian/0000-0003-1107-8682; Mestas, Manina/0000-0001-8813-0018",,,,,51,0,0,6,6,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0093-6502,1552-3810,,COMMUN RES,Commun.

Dynamic panel modeling results suggest that the self-concepts are both sustaining and shifting in daily activities and media activities. Specifically, the potential and actual selves sustained themselves over time in primary and secondary activities, but they also shifted from one to another to achieve a balance in primary activities over time. Interestingly, secondary activities were not driven by the alternative self-concept in primary activities, but instead, by the emotional experiences of primary activities. Furthermore, the findings identified that multitasking to fulfill their actual self did not motivate people to re-prioritize their potential self later.","[Xu, Shan] Texas Tech Univ, Coll Media & Commun, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA; [Wang, Zheng] Ohio State Univ, Sch Commun, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Wang, Zheng] Ohio State Univ, Ctr Cognit & Brain Sci, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University; Ohio State University; Ohio State University,"Xu, S (corresponding author), Texas Tech Univ, Dept Publ Relat, Coll Media & Commun, 3003 15th St, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA.",shan.xu@ttu.edu,,"Xu, Shan/0000-0002-2251-8682",,,,,45,5,5,0,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0093-6502,1552-3810,,COMMUN RES,Commun.

Both studies revealed that people often judged news headlines as fake, suggesting a deception-bias for news in social media. Across studies, we observed an average detection accuracy of approximately 51%, a level consistent with most research using this deception detection paradigm with equal lie-truth base-rates. Study 2 evaluated the effects of endorsement cues in social media (e.g., Facebook likes) on message credibility and detection accuracy. Results showed that headlines associated with a high number of Facebook likes increased credibility, thereby enhancing detection accuracy for real news but undermining accuracy for fake news.

Participants completed self-report measures for dyadic CA and self-esteem. Their cardiac activity was then monitored during noncommunicative and impromptu dyadic communication periods. During interaction, higher dyadic CA manifested strongly in higher HR and lower HRV independently of their mutual influence, suggesting dyadic CA induces psycho-cardiac distress via sympathetic and parasympathetic influences. Regarding self-esteem, there was tentative evidence of a moderating effect for the impact of dyadic CA on HR, but not on HRV. Tests of indirect effects showed significant evidence of its inhibitory influence on both distress symptoms via dyadic CA.

These results suggest that politeness tactics during online debates increase effectiveness, align with normative ideals, and yield pragmatic gain.","[Chiu, Ming Ming] Educ Univ Hong Kong, Analyt & Divers, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Oh, Yu Won] Myongji Univ, Dept Digital Media, 34 Geobukgol Ro, Seoul 03674, South Korea; [Kim, Jeong-Nam] Debiasing & Lay Informat DaLI Lab, Norman, OK USA; [Cionea, Ioana A.] Univ Oklahoma, Dept Commun, Norman, OK 73019 USA",Education University of Hong Kong (EdUHK); Myongji University; University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman,"Oh, YW (corresponding author), Myongji Univ, Dept Digital Media, 34 Geobukgol Ro, Seoul 03674, South Korea.",ywon.oh7@gmail.com,,"Chiu, Ming/0000-0002-5721-1971; Oh, Yu Won/0000-0001-6258-103X",,,,,45,1,1,1,4,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0093-6502,1552-3810,,COMMUN RES,Commun.

This new adaptive frame focuses on adapting to climate change impacts without cueing deeply held beliefs by discussing causes. An experiment shows this frame works by reducing persuasion knowledge and increasing perceived behavioral control, resulting in science skeptics being significantly more likely to intend to take action, engage with the news, and agree with the story's perspective. This effect is moderated by science skepticism, with adaptive frames working significantly better on the very people the news media are not reaching.

Because popular male-female pornography rarely includes condoms, communication researchers have hypothesized that pornography use increases the likelihood of condomless sex in mixed sex encounters. A recent meta-analysis supported this prediction, but was unable to report on psychological moderators of the association due to a dearth of contingency-oriented research. The present study reports findings on U.S. adults' exposure to pornography, perceptions of pornography's realism, and casual condomless sex. Despite theory positing that realism perceptions moderate the relationship between sexual media use and sexual behavior, very few studies have tested pornography exposure x perceived realism interactions in general, and no previous inquiry appears to have tested this interaction in the context of pornography exposure and condom use. Results indicated that a higher range of exposure was associated with a higher likelihood of condomless sex when perceptions of pornography's realism were high. Conversely, when perceptions of pornography's realism were low, range of exposure was unrelated to the likelihood of condomless sex. These results were not moderated by age or gender. These findings are part of a growing literature suggesting the importance of media literacy education directed specifically at pornography.","[Wright, Paul J.; Paul, Bryant] Indiana Univ, Commun Sci, Media Sch, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Herbenick, Debby] Indiana Univ, Ctr Sexual Hlth Promot, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Wright, PJ (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Media Sch, 601 East Kirkwood Ave, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",paulwrig@indiana.edu,,"Herbenick, Debby/0000-0002-0352-2248",Embrey Family Foundation; Fledgling Fund; Harnisch Foundation; Artemis Rising Foundation,Embrey Family Foundation; Fledgling Fund; Harnisch Foundation; Artemis Rising Foundation,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The authors are grateful to the following for their generous support of our research: Julie Parker Benello, Abigail E.

To advance a fuller understanding of how organizations select partners, this study examines the roles of-and relationship between-status and value homophily in interorganizational collaboration (IOC). Specifically, it examines the influence of value homophily (i.e., similar service, staff, and organizational identity) on three forms of status homophily (attribute-based, geography-based, and institutional) in nonprofit collaborative aspirations. Survey data from 141 U.S. faith-based organizations (FBOs) revealed the differential impact of organizational and service religiosity on FBOs' collaboration preferences. Specifically, findings suggest that organizational religiosity makes FBOs more restrictive, but service religiosity makes FBOs less restrictive in ideal partner selection. The results suggest theoretical contributions to communication research on IOC and social networks, as well as implications for navigating multifaceted organizational identities and cross-sector partnerships.","[Fu, Jiawei Sophia] Rutgers State Univ, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA; [Cooper, Katherine R.] Depaul Univ, Coll Commun, Chicago, IL 60604 USA",Rutgers State University New Brunswick; DePaul University,"Fu, JS (corresponding author), Rutgers State Univ, Sch Commun & Informat, Dept Commun, 4 Huntington St, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA.",sophia.fu@rutgers.edu,,,National Science Foundation [SES-1264417]; Rutgers University School of Communication and Information,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Rutgers University School of Communication and Information,"The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was generously supported by the National Science Foundation (SES-1264417) and the faculty start-up funding from the Rutgers University School of Communication and Information.",,66,0,0,3,8,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0093-6502,1552-3810,,COMMUN RES,Commun.

Faculty hires between institutions are conceptualized as interorganizational network ties. Drawing on theoretical insights from network inertia and niche processes in organizational ecology, the current study builds an ecological framework to explain the formation mechanisms of the faculty hiring network among 81 U.S. institutions granting PhDs in communication. Consistent with the predictions of the ecological model of hiring decisions, the empirical results of exponential random graph models (ERGMs) revealed that past behavior (or the presence of previous ties), niche width (or the number of research specializations), and niche overlap (or the degree of shared research specializations) significantly constrained the likelihood of tie creation during the 2015 to 2019 period. These effects held true even when traditional explanations such as network self-organization and status-based hiring patterns were taken into account.

A pre-registered experiment (N = 772) revealed a small-to-medium persistence effect in three out of four topical contexts. While perceived congruence with the opinion climate was not associated with the likelihood of opinion expression, the latter could be explained by a mental cost-benefit calculus that was shaped by message persistence.

In Study 1, we analyze on the macro-level how news-avoiders in 18 EU countries have developed since the late 1980s and what role country variables play in this context. We use multilevel spline models to distinguish between two phases of technological advancement. Findings suggest an increase in news-avoiders in the phase when the Internet was available. The market share of public-service broadcasters is no discerning factor for the number of news-avoiders in different countries. Using German panel-data, Study 2 takes a closer look at the news-avoiders in the Internet phase. We also show the increase of news-avoiders on the micro-level, but do not identify an increasing impact of political interest on news avoidance over time.","[Gorski, Lea C.; Thomas, Fabian] Univ Koblenz Landau, Inst Commun Psychol & Media Educ, Landau, Germany",University of Koblenz & Landau,"Gorski, LC (corresponding author), Univ Koblenz Landau, Campus Landau,Fortstr 7, D-76829 Landau, Germany.",gorski@uni-landau.de,,"Gorski, Lea C./0000-0003-4022-5514",,,,,86,2,2,3,13,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0093-6502,1552-3810,,COMMUN RES,Commun.

In light of this, this research re-directs our attention to the specific communicative antecedents of an organization's overall propensity for innovation. Survey data from 293 nonprofit organizations showed that interorganizational partnership diversity, knowledge sharing via the use of information communication technologies (ICTs), and entrepreneurial orientation affect organizational innovativeness, with differential effects on administrative innovativeness and technological innovativeness. Specifically, interorganizational partnership diversity promoted administrative innovativeness but had an inverted U-shaped curvilinear relationship with technological innovativeness. Effective ICT-mediated knowledge sharing improved technological innovativeness only. The combination of interorganizational partnership diversity and EO (i.e., proactiveness) increased administrative innovativeness. However, interorganizational partnership diversity and effective knowledge sharing indirectly influenced technological innovativeness via proactiveness. This study advances research on organizational innovation, ICTs, and interorganizational networks.","[Fu, Jiawei Sophia] Rutgers State Univ, New Brunswick, NJ USA",Rutgers State University New Brunswick,"Fu, JS (corresponding author), Rutgers State Univ, Dept Commun, Sch Commun & Informat, 4 Huntington St, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA.",sophia.fu@rutgers.edu,,,Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grant of the National Science Foundation [SES-1730079]; Doctoral Dissertation Grant of the School of Communication of Northwestern University; Graduate Research Grant of The Graduate School of Northwestern University; Rutgers University School of Communication and Information,Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grant of the National Science Foundation; Doctoral Dissertation Grant of the School of Communication of Northwestern University; Graduate Research Grant of The Graduate School of Northwestern University; Rutgers University School of Communication and Information,"The author disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was funded by the Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grant of the National Science Foundation (SES-1730079), Doctoral Dissertation Grant of the School of Communication of Northwestern University, Graduate Research Grant of The Graduate School of Northwestern University, and Rutgers University School of Communication and Information faculty startup funding.",,83,1,1,6,23,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0093-6502,1552-3810,,COMMUN RES,Commun.

Instead of focusing on the tone of political talk, scholars interested in understanding the extent to which digital platforms threaten democratic values should focus on expressions of intolerance. I demonstrate the validity of this conceptual model by investigating the discursive and contextual features associated with incivility and intolerance online in the context of public comments in two different platforms-news websites and Facebook. Results show that incivility and intolerance occur in meaningfully different discussion settings. Whereas incivility is associated with features that reveal meaningful discursive engagement, such as justified opinion expression and engagement with disagreement, intolerance is likely to occur in homogeneous discussions about minorities and civil society-exactly when it can hurt democracy the most.","[Rossini, Patricia] Univ Liverpool, Dept Commun & Media, Liverpool, Merseyside, England",University of Liverpool,"Rossini, P (corresponding author), Univ Liverpool, Dept Commun & Media, Sch Arts, 19 Abercromby Sq, Liverpool L69 7GZ, Merseyside, England.",patricia.rossini@liverpool.ac.uk,"Rossini, Patrícia/I-9377-2019","Rossini, Patrícia/0000-0002-4463-6444",Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior-Brasil (CAPES) [001],Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior-Brasil (CAPES)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)),"The author disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study was supported, in part, by the Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior-Brasil (CAPES)-Finance Code 001.",,78,40,40,4,23,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0093-6502,1552-3810,,COMMUN RES,Commun.

Integrating the literature from public relations and public health disciplines, this study proposes a theoretical model to predict individuals' perceptions, communicative action, as well as their behaviors to follow the governments' instructions in the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States. Linking relationship management factors and the framework of the situational theory of problem-solving, the findings of this study demonstrate that authentic communication and relational quality can help increase positive perceptual, attitudinal, and behavioral outcomes desired by governments regarding pandemic management. However, our findings suggested that unproductive uses of authentic governmental communication may create adverse effects on publics' perceptions and interpretations and thus pose potential risks, particularly when a public health issue is significantly politicized. Specifically, this study found that, in the case of the COVID-19 pandemic in which the Trump administration was blamed for lack of planning and halting responses in the fight against the virus, conservatives who believe that the federal government is practicing authentic communication during the pandemic would consider the issue less important and irreverent; meanwhile, they would recognize more barriers to adopt preventive actions.

While individuals have concerns about firms' data collection practices, they sometimes appear to disclose personal information for relatively small rewards. We demonstrate that privacy cynicism-an attitude toward privacy protection characterized by frustration, hopelessness, and disillusionment-explains this paradox by moderating the relationship between the appraisal of privacy threats and privacy coping behaviors on one side, and privacy protection behaviors on the other side. Results of a U.S. national survey (N = 993) show that privacy cynicism is negatively related to privacy protection behaviors and significantly moderates relationships of perceived vulnerability, response efficacy, disclosure benefits, and response costs on protection behaviors. Hence, this work has important implications for communication theory by extending existing models of privacy management behaviors, as well as for communication practice, by stressing the importance of creating awareness about privacy cynicism.","[van Ooijen, Iris] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Commun Sci, Inst Behav Sci, Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Segijn, Claire M.] Univ Minnesota, Hubbard Sch Journalism & Mass Commun, Advertising, Minneapolis, MN USA; [Opree, Suzanna J.] Erasmus Univ, Dept Media & Commun, Quantitat Res Methods, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [van Ooijen, Iris] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Behav Sci Inst, Thomas Aquinostr 4, NL-6525 GD Nijmegen, Netherlands",Radboud University Nijmegen; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Radboud University Nijmegen,"van Ooijen, I (corresponding author), Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Behav Sci Inst, Thomas Aquinostr 4, NL-6525 GD Nijmegen, Netherlands.",iris.vanooijen@ru.nl,,"van Ooijen, Iris/0000-0002-1907-6158",,,,,64,3,3,21,35,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0093-6502,1552-3810,,COMMUN RES,Commun.

How the tension between citizens' desires to engage in online political expression and the possible dire consequences of doing so is resolved, however, is understudied. We address this lacuna by drawing upon concepts from risk and decision-making research and examining how the emotional and cognitive components of risk and decision-making shape citizens' online political expression. Employing a three-wave panel survey of Turkish internet users collected over 8 months, our fixed-effects regression analyzes show that anticipatory emotions drive expressive behavior, but that risk assessment does not. Furthermore, the influence of negative emotions on online expression is moderated by individuals' degree of regime opposition. We discuss the importance of understanding the psychological mechanisms by which networked authoritarian contexts influences citizens' decisions to engage in contentious online speech.","[Dal, Aysenur] Bilkent Univ, Dept Commun & Design, Ankara, Turkey; [Nisbet, Erik C.] Northwestern Univ, Sch Commun, Policy Anal & Commun, Evanston, IL USA",Ihsan Dogramaci Bilkent University; Northwestern University,"Dal, A (corresponding author), Bilkent Univ, Dept Commun & Design, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey.",aysenur.dal@bilkent.edu.tr,,"Dal, Aysenur/0000-0003-2868-0282",,,,,95,3,3,5,37,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0093-6502,1552-3810,,COMMUN RES,Commun.

Journalists are ideal test subjects to explore these issues as professional trust allocators, who receive immediate feedback on right and wrong trust decisions. The study differentiates, for the first time, between source and message credibility evaluations, based on a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods. Findings show that journalists can distinguish source and message credibility. However, in practice they rely on source evaluations as an autopilot default mode, shifting gears to observations of source and message credibility in epistemically complex cases. The proportion between both is close to Pareto distribution. This extreme division challenges both inductive and mixed inference theories of epistemic trust and suggests revisiting the typification doctrine of newswork. Data partially support the hegemony and epistemic injustice theory, showing that traditional credibility criteria might trigger the exclusion of nontraditional voices.","[Barnoy, Aviv] Zefat Acad Coll, Dept Community Informat Syst, Safed, Israel; [Barnoy, Aviv] Univ Haifa, Dept Philosophy, Haifa, Israel; [Reich, Zvi] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Commun Studies, Beer Sheva, Israel",University of Haifa; Ben Gurion University,"Barnoy, A (corresponding author), Zefat Acad Coll, Mushmar Hagvul 9th, IL-3825103 Hadera, Israel.",avivbarnoy@gmail.com,,"Barnoy, Aviv/0000-0002-6067-7094",,,,,80,7,7,1,7,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0093-6502,1552-3810,,COMMUN RES,Commun.

Where is the line between personal social media use and professional identities? What is the difference between holding people in positions of power to account and invading the privacy of everyday people? What kinds of social media posts get people fired? In this article, we report on a study of 312 news media articles that document stories of people being fired because of a social media post. We divide the corpus into posts made by the individuals who are fired (self-posts, n=264) and posts made by others that resulted in the subject of those posts losing their job (third party, n = 48). Racism was the most common reason people were fired in these news stories, followed by other forms of discriminatory behavior (such as queerphobia), offensive content, workplace conflict, political content, acts of violence, and abuse. We examine these narratives through the lens of what van Dijck describes as professional value, and ultimately seek to question how these stories normalize the hidden curriculum of surveillance, putting additional pressure on employees and young people who are called to act on social media through the prism of future employment.","[Robards, Brady; Graf, Darren] Monash Univ, Melbourne, Vic 3800, Australia",Monash University,"Robards, B (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Melbourne, Vic 3800, Australia.",brady.robards@monash.edu,,"Robards, Brady/0000-0001-5031-1235",Australian Research Council (ARC) [DE190100858],Australian Research Council (ARC)(Australian Research Council),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This project was funded by the Australian Research Council (ARC) Discovery Early Career Research Award (DECRA) scheme, DE190100858.",,60,1,1,7,14,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",2056-3051,,,SOC MEDIA SOC,Soc.

In addition, we examine which actors are posting far-right content and what kind of roles they play in the network of Telegram groups. The findings indicate the presence of far-right discourses among the COVID-19 groups. However, the existence of these groups was not solely driven by the extreme right, and the incidence of far-right discourses was not equal across all COVID-19 protest groups. We interpret these findings under the prism of the mediation opportunity structure: while the far right appears to have taken advantage of the network opportunity structure afforded by deplatforming and the migration to Telegram, it did not succeed in diffusing its ideas widely among the COVID-19 protest groups in the Irish Telegram.","[Curley, Cliona] Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Comp Sci, Dublin, Ireland; [Siapera, Eugenia] Univ Coll Dublin, Informat & Commun Studies, Dublin, Ireland; [Siapera, Eugenia] Univ Coll Dublin, Ctr Digital Policy, Dublin, Ireland; [Carthy, Joe] Univ Coll Dublin, Comp Sci, Dublin, Ireland; [Carthy, Joe] Univ Coll Dublin, Sci, Dublin, Ireland; [Carthy, Joe] Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Comp Sci & Informat, Dublin, Ireland",University College Dublin; University College Dublin; University College Dublin; University College Dublin; University College Dublin; University College Dublin,"Siapera, E (corresponding author), Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Informat & Commun Studies, Stillorgan Rd, Dublin 4, Ireland.",eugenia.siapem@ucd.ie,,"Siapera, Eugenia/0000-0002-5277-5655",Irish Research Council [COALESCE/2021/39],"Irish Research Council(Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology)","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study was conducted as part of PhD research funded by the Irish Research Council under award number GOIPG/2020/1076.

Results show that multi-platform social media use prompts incidental exposure to counter-attitudinal news and further encourages people to cognitively elaborate on the counter-attitudinal information, which in turn contributes to news engagement on social media. However, news engagement is performed in a biased way that is supportive of like-minded content and non-supportive of counter-attitudinal content. Furthermore, the indirect effect of multi-platform social media use on biased news engagement becomes stronger when one's network is more homogeneous. Although studies have pointed to the democratic prospects of multi-platform social media use as it leads to cross-cutting exposure, our results suggest that it could lead users to engage with news in ways that confirm their pre-existing attitudes and disconfirm counter-attitudinal ones.","[Guo, Jing; Chen, Hsuan-Ting] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Sch Journalism & Commun, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Chinese University of Hong Kong,"Chen, HT (corresponding author), Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Sch Journalism & Commun, New Asia Coll, Shatin, Humanities Bldg, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",htchen@cuhk.edu.hk,,"Chen, Hsuan-Ting/0000-0003-3140-5169","Faculty of Social Science, Chinese University of Hong Kong [SS15758]","Faculty of Social Science, Chinese University of Hong Kong(Chinese University of Hong Kong)","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the Direct Grant from the Faculty of Social Science, Chinese University of Hong Kong (project no.

While the attacks were seen as an affront to French values and ways of life, online exchanges have traveled around the globe. Especially with social media platforms, such as Twitter and Instagram, offering immediate translations of captions has increased the reach of posts immensely. Specifically, hashtag use has the ability to transcend national boundaries and helps in the creation of echo chambers and or fuels trench warfare online. This article extends on this work by examining how the image of Islam is transmitted and changed on Instagram through the use of the hashtag #CharlieHebdo. Specifically, the following three primary research questions are examined: (1) How does hashtag co-occurrence, in the discussion surrounding Charlie Hebdo, indicate echo chamber behavior? (2) How does trench warfare impact the debate surrounding the image of Islam within the #CharlieHebdo conversation? (3) Which categories can posts be put into based on other hashtags that are used simultaneously? To answer these questions, Instagram posts, posted nearly 6 years after the Charlie Hebdo attack was perpetrated in Paris and during the time of the trials of the suspects took place, are used as a case study. It was found that Islamophobia within the Charlie Hebdo debate online indeed indicates echo chamber behavior. The significance of this study was found to be two-fold. First, it extends the research on detecting echo chamber behavior through social network analysis and sentiment analysis of co-used hashtags. Second, it highlights the fact that trench warfare is a well understood tactic by Instagram users, for the hijacking of hashtags, and the role it plays in the polarization of hashtag communities.","[Aydin, Zeynep] Philipps Univ Marburg, Marburg, Germany; [Fuess, Albrecht] Philipps Univ Marburg, Ctr Near & Middle Eastern Studies, Islamic Studies Dept, Marburg, Germany; [Foerster, Marcel] Philipps Univ Marburg, Marburg Ctr Digital Culture & Infrastruct, Marburg, Germany; [Sunier, Thijl] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Philipps University Marburg; Philipps University Marburg; Philipps University Marburg; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Aydin, Z (corresponding author), Philipps Univ Marburg, Ctr Near & Middle Eastern Studies, Deutschhausstr 12, D-35037 Marburg, Germany.",zeynep.aydin@uni-marburg.de,,"Aydin, Zeynep/0000-0002-4234-2717","European Union [813547]; Open Access Publication Fund of Philipps-Universitat Marburg; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation)","European Union(European Commission); Open Access Publication Fund of Philipps-Universitat Marburg; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation)(German Research Foundation (DFG))","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This paper is part of the project that has received funding from the European Union Horizon ITN research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska Curie grant agreement N degrees 813547.

Although misinformation is rampant on all platforms, literature on fact-checks (FC) focuses primarily on public ones. This article provides an integrated psychological model and argues that FC is less effective on private platforms. People expect to encounter unwelcome FCs (incongruent with their beliefs) on public platforms, but selectively approach the welcome FC on private platforms. An experiment (n = 601) and a national survey (n = 1060) were implemented to test these hypotheses in the 2020 Taiwan Presidential Election. The experiment shows that respondents prefer FC on Line, which helps their party, but prefer FC on Facebook which disadvantages their party. The survey shows that consuming FC with more private platform usage has lower media literacy, while is the opposite on public platforms. Future work should focus on both FC and how it is consumed.","[Wang, Austin Horng-En] Univ Nevada, Polit Sci, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA",Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Las Vegas,"Wang, AHE (corresponding author), Univ Nevada, Dept Polit Sci, 4505 S Maryland Pkwy, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA.",austin.wang@unlv.edu,,"Wang, Austin/0000-0002-0256-2723",UNLV University Libraries Open Article Fund,UNLV University Libraries Open Article Fund,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Both Study 1 and Study 2 are supported by the author's research grant in the Department of Political Science at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.

A total of 722 respondents in China participated in the survey from November 2020 to December 2020. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to analyze the data. Our findings indicate that respondents who report collectivist norms tend to experience higher levels of wellbeing (and lower levels of anxiety), regardless of their scores for media use, media attention, or media dependency. Conversely, those respondents who record low collectivism tend to have higher levels of anxiety (and lower wellbeing), even if they report lower media use, attention and dependency during the pandemic. Study results also found that anxiety mediates the relationship between media use and wellbeing. Our introduction of collectivism as a possible moderating variable represents a significant contribution to current academic debates and suggests the inclusion of cultural factors for future studies on media use and anxiety/wellbeing during public health crises.","[Gong, Jiankun; Firdaus, Amira] Univ Malaya, Fac Arts & Social Sci, Dept Media & Commun Studies, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Said, Fareyha] Univ Malaya, Fac Business & Accountancy, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Aksar, Iffat Ali] Univ Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Danaee, Mahmoud] Univ Malaya, Fac Med, Dept Social & Prevent Med, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Xu, Jinghong] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Journalism & Commun, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China",Universiti Malaya; Universiti Malaya; Universiti Malaya; Universiti Malaya; Beijing Normal University,"Xu, JH (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Journalism & Commun, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",123abctg@163.com,"Gong, Jiankun/GLU-3582-2022; Firdaus, Amira/AAA-5885-2021; Xu, Jinghong/B-3801-2010; Gong, Jiankun/ABG-4197-2021","Firdaus, Amira/0000-0002-0609-7371; Xu, Jinghong/0000-0003-4654-0603; Gong, Jiankun/0000-0003-3785-7449",National Social Science Fund of China [20ZDA057],National Social Science Fund of China,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This article has been produced as part of the major project of the National Social Science Fund of China, Research on the Establishment of Omnimedia Communication System (Grant No. 20ZDA057).",,76,1,1,14,18,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",2056-3051,,,SOC MEDIA SOC,Soc.

Study 1 conducted manual and automated text analyses using App Store archives via the Wayback Machine to evaluate changes in the industry presentation over time. Analyses showed how Path placed consistent emphasis on its ability to reinforce close ties and provide a curation-centered version of authenticity. Study 2 analyzed how users and commenters discussed Path over the same period via topic modeling of a Twitter corpus, revealing the centrality of rise-and-fall narratives to conversation about the platform. Together, the studies displayed how Path's growth foretold changes in the social media ecosystem and how online conversation diverged from industry logics. To conclude, we discuss how Path's history parallels theories on personal network changes, including the importance of user-driven versus algorithm-driven curation. To that end, we showcase the potential (and challenges) of using digital traces to uncover the evolution of platforms from the perspectives of different stakeholders.","[Bayer, Joseph B.] Ohio State Univ, Sch Commun, 154 N Oval Mall, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Bayer, Joseph B.] Ohio State Univ, Translat Data Analyt Inst, 154 N Oval Mall, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Sweitzer, Matthew D.; Xiang, Haoyan] Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Sweitzer, Matthew D.] Sandia Natl Labs, POB 5800, Albuquerque, NM 87185 USA; [Mohan, Sriram] Univ Michigan, Commun & Media, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Myers, Ellen] Univ Cambridge, Social Anthropol, Cambridge, England",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Sandia National Laboratories; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Cambridge,"Bayer, JB (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Sch Commun, 154 N Oval Mall, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.;Bayer, JB (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Translat Data Analyt Inst, 154 N Oval Mall, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",Bayer.66@osu.edu,,"Sweitzer, Matthew/0000-0002-2075-6177",,,,,68,0,0,1,1,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",2056-3051,,,SOC MEDIA SOC,Soc.

It also makes them useful vectors for sowing disinformation. This research assumes a multi-platform perspective, describing the particularities of how chat apps can be used toward disseminating mis-and disinformation by way of cascade logic-the means by which information in chat app ecologies is trafficked upstream (making its way from private conversations into the mainstream) as well as downstream (allowing information to withdraw from the public eye), providing space for distortion along the way. Cascade logic also describes how chat apps allow the gradual withdrawal and self-segregation of individuals into, or emergence out of, layered spaces of privacy and obfuscation. We present an interview-based study exploring chat apps in three countries, synthesizing unifying dimensions across cultures and contexts: India, the United States, and Mexico. We analyze data from in-depth conversations with 33 individuals who work to either produce or track political content on chat apps. These interviewees work for a wide array of organizations: political parties, governments, extremist groups, digital political consultancies, news entities, and civil society organizations.

Accordingly, companies developing, providing, and maintaining game engines-such as Epic Games or Unity Technologies-are set to become influential actors in all social and economic arenas that start to rely on game engines for the provision of software or services. This makes them an important subject to the study of platforms as they provide increasingly crucial building blocks in the digitization of economic, political, and social life. In this article, we present three dimensions demonstrating platform functions of game engines beyond gaming. We rely on the example of two important game engine developers: Epic Games and Unity Technologies. The dimensions are (1) the growing area of extended reality applications, (2) cross-platform and cross-media story- and brand worlds, and (3) the management of user payments, identities, and social graphs. The article shows how companies providing game engines challenge the current balance of power between established platform companies, demonstrating that game engines have emerged as an important new type of platform that demands academic and public attention.","[Jungherr, Andreas] Univ Bamberg, Chair Governance Complex & Innovat Technol Syst, Bamberg, Germany; [Schlarb, Damien B.] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Amer Studies, Mainz, Germany",Otto Friedrich University Bamberg; Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz,"Jungherr, A (corresponding author), Univ Bamberg, Inst Polit Sci, Chair Governance Complex & Innovat Technol Syst, Feldkirchenstr 21, D-96052 Bamberg, Germany.",andreas.jungherr@uni-bamberg.de,"Jungherr, Andreas/P-7958-2016","Jungherr, Andreas/0000-0003-2598-2453",,,,,75,1,1,34,34,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",2056-3051,,,SOC MEDIA SOC,Soc.

The objective of this article is to analyze the changes on the discussion of different COVID-19 conspiracy theories throughout the pandemic on Twitter. We have collected a data set of 1.269 million tweets associated with the discussion on conspiracy theories between January 2020 and November 2021. The data set includes tweets related to eight conspiracy theories: the 5G, Big Pharma, Bill Gates, biological weapon, exaggeration, FilmYourHospital, genetically modified organism (GMO), and the vaccines conspiracy. The analysis highlights several behaviors in the discussion of conspiracy theories and allows categorizing them into four groups. The first group are conspiracy theories that peaked at the beginning of the pandemic and sharply declined afterwards, including the 5G and FilmYourHospital conspiracies. The second group associated with the Big Pharma and vaccination-related conspiracy whose role increased as the pandemic progressed. The third are conspiracies that remained persistent throughout the pandemic such as exaggeration and Bill Gates conspiracies. The fourth are those that had multiple peaks at different times of the pandemic including the GMO and biological weapon conspiracies. In addition, the number of COVID-19 new cases was found to be a significant predictor for the next week tweet frequency for most of the conspiracies.","[Erokhin, Dmitry; Komendantova, Nadejda] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Schlosspl 1, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria; [Yosipof, Abraham] Coll Law & Business, Fac Informat Syst & Comp Sci, Ramat Gan, Israel",International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA),"Erokhin, D (corresponding author), Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Schlosspl 1, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria.",erokhin@iiasa.ac.at,,"Yosipof, Abraham/0000-0002-3176-8982",European Union [101021746],European Union(European Commission),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was funded by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under grant agreement No. 101021746, CORE (science and human factor for resilient society).",,45,0,0,7,7,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",2056-3051,,,SOC MEDIA SOC,Soc.

In this context, social media is a space of opportunity and risk to face discrimination and othering. In this article, we draw upon postcolonial theory and Internet studies to consider TikTok affordances as tools that are relevant to understand how cultural, national, and religious identities are shaped and presented in digital spaces. In this sense, this study constitutes the first exploratory analysis of Moroccan-Spanish mixed couples' (self)representations and identity construction as reflected by their TikTok content. The memetic and intersectional aspects of the mixed-couple identity emerge as central in the convergent nature of the platform and their lived experiences. Through an initial analysis of 8,653 TikTok videos, we identified 6 creator accounts with more than 10K followers to conduct a deeper multimodal content and discourse analysis of 146 videos. This enabled us to explore how these creators portray their hybrid identity through short, vertical videos harnessing TikTok's vernaculars and affordances. The results enable us to propose the concept of performative hybridization, which involves discursive markers within these couples' TikTok content that reflect a fluid integration of two cultures, while the pervading visual and narrative components reflect the dominance of one set of identity traits over the other. In this case, Moroccan culture is more prevalent.","[Civila, Sabina] Univ Huelva, Avda Fuerzas Armadas S-N, Huelva 21071, Spain; [Jaramillo-Dent, Daniela] Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam, Netherlands",Universidad de Huelva; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Civila, S (corresponding author), Univ Huelva, Avda Fuerzas Armadas S-N, Huelva 21071, Spain.",sabicivila@gmail.com,"Jaramillo-Dent, Daniela/AAD-5509-2020","Jaramillo-Dent, Daniela/0000-0001-8372-0107; CIVILA, Sabina/0000-0001-6059-9893",,,,,49,1,1,6,6,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",2056-3051,,,SOC MEDIA SOC,Soc.

We rely on semi-structured interviews and thematic analysis of communication on Telegram during this mobilization. We offer a theory of leadership in an IMP-organized anti-authoritarian movement. It suggests that the use of messaging platforms during social media protest mobilization enhances capacities for visibility management and polycentricity in such movements. It also fosters the emergence of a specific type of protest movement leader-or shadow anti-authoritarian leadership-that is collective, polycentric, and concealed.","[Herasimenka, Aliaksandr] Univ Westminster, 309 Regent St, London W1B 2HW, England; [Herasimenka, Aliaksandr] Univ Oxford, Oxford, England",University of Westminster; University of Oxford,"Herasimenka, A (corresponding author), Univ Westminster, 309 Regent St, London W1B 2HW, England.",a.herasimenka2@westminster.ac.uk,,"Herasimenka, Aliaksandr/0000-0002-5876-5562",,,,,46,0,0,0,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",2056-3051,,,SOC MEDIA SOC,Soc.

Far-right groups, including the alt-right, are using social media in ways that entice people into far-right spaces that perpetuate hate online and in person. The alt-right spreads hateful messaging through Internet memes, and those who are unfamiliar with alt-right strategies may encounter these memes and engage with them. In this study, we examined whether parents of adolescents would engage with alt-right memes as well as if they understood the memes. We utilized a novel research design by presenting participants with memes and asking questions about engagement. We also included a measure of New Media Literacy to assess participants' skills with navigating social media. Results reveal that a majority of parent participants would either knowingly interact with at least one alt-right meme or they were unable to discern the covert messaging in the alt-right memes. The impact of engagement with alt-right content on social media needs to be addressed in order to inform approaches to educate adults, especially parents, about how hateful ideologies spread on the Internet.","[Burnham, Sarah L.

Today, they are produced, consumed, and circulated on various online media environments. From memes on 4chan, QAnon influencers on Instagram, to flat earth or antivaxx videos on YouTube, modern-day conspiracy culture embodies compelling mediated images and narratives that are composed of various audiovisual materials. Building on Stuart Hall's encoding/decoding model, and Henry Jenkins' notion of participatory culture, we analyze these audiovisual conspiracy theories as oppositional readings of hegemonic truths. More concretely, we analyze how conspiracy theorists reconstruct various audiovisual (mass-media) materials into streamlined narratives on YouTube videos to picture opaque power. Based on an in-depth qualitative analysis of 24 conspiracy theory videos, strategically selected from a larger sample of 200, we present three major categories of audiovisual narrative construction in conspiracy videos on YouTube: (1) Simulating: using fiction, religious and cultural images and narratives to render images of events otherwise invisible; (2) Deciphering: decoding hidden messages by closely reading images and looking for hidden symbolism; (3) Exhibiting: exposing information, research, and images that are hidden in plain sight but point to conspiracy. This article contributes to the growing body of literature on conspiracy theories by showing how they are not just texts, but should better be seen as media practices involving the recontextualizing of (mass)media material into new audiovisual conspiracy theory narratives. This shapes not just their content and form, but also their place in public discourse.","[Grusauskaite, Kamile] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Leuven, Belgium; [Aupers, Stef] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Media Culture, Inst Media Studies, Leuven, Belgium; [Harambam, Jaron] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Participatory AI, Athena Inst, Amsterdam, Netherlands",KU Leuven; KU Leuven; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Grusauskaite, K (corresponding author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, Inst Media Studies, Pk Str 45,Box 3603, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.",kamile.grusauskaite@kuleuven.be,"; Harambam, Jaron/A-8527-2012","Grusauskaite, Kamile/0000-0003-1675-7051; Harambam, Jaron/0000-0002-8286-7147",,,,,56,0,0,11,13,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",2056-3051,,,SOC MEDIA SOC,Soc.

The second case involves one of the most popular hubs of online skateboarding today: The Berrics YouTube channel, which claims 1.3 million subscribers and over 4,500 individual videos. I show how The Berrics maintains a one-dimensional positivity through its posts and interactions with fans, and I argue that it is still experimenting with the handling of negative feedback that participatory media allow.

In this special issue, we combine longitudinal and cross-national studies of social media in election campaigns, expanding the time span as well as number of countries compared to former comparative studies. The four papers present examples of longitudinal studies, covering multiple election cycles from four different countries: Australia, the United States of America, Denmark, and Italy. By including the countries mentioned, we focus on countries considered to be first movers when it comes to the digitization and internetization of the political life. As such, they are most similar cases. However, they also have different political systems: the United States and Australia are characterized by a Westminster system dominated by a few large parties and a tradition of strong confrontation between government and opposition, whereas Denmark and Italy are multi-party systems with a tradition of collaboration and coalition governments. Technologically, the four countries might be similar, but politically and in terms of media systems, they differ; the United States is characterized by a commercialized American media system with little role for public service broadcasters, Denmark has very strong public service media, and Australia has elements of both these systems. Finally, Italy represents a Southern European media system with traces of clientelism as well as public service media. Thus, studies of the four countries form a diverse yet solid set of cases for exploring the growing (and changing) role of social media in national elections.","[Jensen, Jakob Linaa] Aarhus Univ, Media Studies, Aarhus, Denmark; [Schwartz, Sander Andreas] Roskilde Univ, Dept Commun & Arts, Roskilde, Denmark",Aarhus University; Roskilde University,"Jensen, JL (corresponding author), Aarhus Univ, DK-8000 Aarhus, Denmark.",linaa@cc.au.dk,,"Schwartz, Sander Andreas/0000-0001-6303-3318; Jensen, Jakob Linaa/0000-0002-9617-187X",,,,,18,0,0,1,4,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",2056-3051,,,SOC MEDIA SOC,Soc.

Limited scholarship has explored the role of memes within closed communities, where perceived privacy and trust may impact the ways users demarcate the in-group (us) and out-group (them) through humor. This article draws on analysis of semi-structured interviews with Australian donor-conceived people (people conceived with donor sperm or eggs) and a collection of memes they shared. We take an interdisciplinary approach to analysis, combining reflexive thematic analysis informed by interpretive traditions within sociology with an analysis that applies the iconization framework from social semiotics. Our findings explore how donor-conceived people view memes as: texts that only we get, that are light and fun and that provide a way to deal with emotions. We conceptualize memes as bonding icons: semiotic artifacts which foreground shared feelings and invite alignment around a collective identity. More broadly, we argue that getting a meme requires alignment with the values construed, a process which reinforces ties to the community. In doing so, we explore how everyday social and linguistic practices contribute to individuals' sense of belonging.","[Newton, Giselle; Drysdale, Kerryn; Newman, Christy E.] UNSW Sydney, Ctr Social Res Hlth, High St Kensington, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Zappavigna, Michele] UNSW Sydney, Sch Arts & Media, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Newman, Christy E.] UNSW Sydney, Fac Arts Design & Architecture, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney; University of New South Wales Sydney; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Newton, G (corresponding author), UNSW Sydney, Ctr Social Res Hlth, High St Kensington, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",g.newton@unsw.edu.au,,"Newton, Giselle/0000-0002-2883-335X; Drysdale, Kerryn/0000-0001-5545-290X",Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship,"Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and Science)","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Giselle Newton is supported by an Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship.",,48,1,1,4,9,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",2056-3051,,,SOC MEDIA SOC,Soc.

This study demonstrates how social media users actively participate in the discursive construction of the other, and how the women's rights movement in Pakistan continues to struggle against hegemonic scripts of gender and sexuality.","[Sadaf, Shomaila; Siitonen, Marko] Univ Jyvaskyla, Jyvaskyla, Finland",University of Jyvaskyla,"Sadaf, S (corresponding author), Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Language & Commun Studies, POB 35, FI-40014 Jyvaskyla, Finland.",shomaila.s.sadaf@student.jyu.fi,,"Siitonen, Marko/0000-0002-5138-437X; Sadaf, Shomaila/0000-0002-2684-0847",,,,,63,0,0,6,8,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",2056-3051,,,SOC MEDIA SOC,Soc.

Based on a visual content analysis of 205 TikTok videos across the application's 43 most followed male creators, we examine representations of masculinity on the platform. Drawing on the concept of hybrid masculinity, we find that TikTok creators both challenge and reinforce traditional notions of masculinity, subverting widely recognizable tropes, and gender norms while simultaneously reinforcing the importance of men's muscularity, attractiveness, and sexual bravado.

A continuous attentiveness to social space is connected to features of Gesellschaft in social media: the utilization of people's data traces for economic purposes. The social media natives' online activities are still tied to the market rationales of social media corporations, however, as platforms both facilitate and profit from their practices.

Our qualitative interviews with 44 individuals offer nuanced insights into what social media meant to people during quarantine, how they used it, and how they reflected on their experience of it. Five major themes emerged through reflexive, thematic analysis of the interview data: changed temporal rhythms, influx of toxic content, resource building, additive and subtractive actions, and algorithmic awareness. Some participants described social media as an increasingly harmful influence in their lives during the pandemic due to compulsive usage and exposure to toxic content like misinformation, weight stigma, and homophobia. At the same time, participants noted how social media positively enabled social connection, education, and activation around social justice. Across both of these extremes, many elaborated on the intensive, self-reflective labor of cultivating their accounts so that they mirrored their identities and the kinds of experiences they wanted to have online while preventing the infiltration of unwanted content. In addition to offering new insights into social media usage in body justice communities during COVID-19, our data suggest alternative ways of understanding how individuals manage their experience of social media, curate their social media feeds through additive and subtractive actions, and frequently reflect on how their choices interact with platform algorithms.","[Greene, Amanda K.] Lehigh Univ, Humanities Lab, 35 Sayre Dr, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA; [Maloul, Elana] Univ Michigan, English Language & Literature, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Kelly, Devin A.; Norling, Hannah N.] Univ Denver, Counseling Psychol, Denver, CO USA; [Brownstone, Lisa M.] Univ Denver, Counseling Psychol Dept, Practice, Denver, CO USA",Lehigh University; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Denver; University of Denver,"Greene, AK (corresponding author), Lehigh Univ, Humanities Lab, 35 Sayre Dr, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA.",akg319@lehigh.edu,"Greene, Amanda/AGG-1421-2022","Norling, Hannah/0000-0001-9336-6498; Greene, Amanda/0000-0003-1035-5617; Kelly, Devin/0000-0002-6635-726X",,,,,66,2,2,13,18,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",2056-3051,,,SOC MEDIA SOC,Soc.

Researchers have coined the term imagined audience for the social groups that actors imagine seeing their public communication. However, social groups are not the only aspect that requires imagination: In the potentially borderless online environment, the geographical scope and locations of one's audience are also unknown. Furthermore, research has demonstrated that imagined audiences vary between people and situations, but what explains these variations is unclear. In this article, we address these two gaps-the geographical scope and predictors of imagined audiences-using data from a mobile experience sampling method study of 105 active Twitter users from Berlin, Germany. Our results show that respondents mostly think of a geographically broad audience, which is spread out across the country or even globally. The imagined geographical scope and social groups depend on both the communicator and the usage situation. While the audience's social composition especially depends on tweet content and respondents' sociodemographic characteristics, the geographical scope is best explained by respondents' biography and personal mobility, including their experience of living in other countries and local residential duration.","[Stoltenberg, Daniela; Keinert, Alexa] Free Univ Berlin, Berlin, Germany; [Pfetsch, Barbara] Free Univ Berlin, Commun Theory & Media Effects Res, Berlin, Germany; [Keinert, Alexa] Gfa Publ GmbH, Berlin, Germany; [Waldherr, Annie] Univ Vienna, Computat Commun Sci, Vienna, Austria",Free University of Berlin; Free University of Berlin; University of Vienna,"Stoltenberg, D (corresponding author), Free Univ Berlin, Inst Media & Commun Studies, Otto von Simson Str 3, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.",daniela.stoltenberg@fu-berlin.de,,,"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) [290045248-SFB 1265]","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation)(German Research Foundation (DFG))","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation)-Project number 290045248-SFB 1265.",,38,0,0,4,4,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",2056-3051,,,SOC MEDIA SOC,Soc.

However, this harassment is subject to gendered dynamics, as women journalists are most often the target of online abuse, and the attacks themselves are often gender-centric. This study employs a mixed-method approach to explore how gender influences broadcast journalists' social media interactions with audiences. Qualitative interviews with US broadcast journalists, along with a social media discourse analysis of the journalists' Twitter pages, reveal the sexist nature of these interactions. Specifically, findings show that women journalists are treated not only as sexual objects, but also as non-serious journalists. In response to this treatment, women journalists adjust their social media strategies by limiting what they post and blocking certain users. This puts women journalists in a difficult position: increase coveted audience engagement and deal with online harassment or block abusive social media users and suffer the career impacts of low audience engagement.

In this article, I interrogated sites of intersection and friction between mediated memory and identity work to uncover their shared political potential. I conducted a visual discourse analysis of Facebook Live videos and Instagram photos captured at the gravesite of famed women's suffragist Susan B. Anthony during the 2016 US presidential election. In a long-standing Election Day tradition in Rochester, NY, local women visit Anthony's grave after casting their ballots to pay tribute to her suffrage activism. However, when the nation saw its first woman presidential candidate nominated by a major political party in 2016, the gravesite drew an unprecedented crowd. The resulting media texts both capture and shape memory and identity work as they unfold. Ultimately, I identify a collection of four discursive practices that illustrate distinct modes of interdependence between memory and identity work in the gravesite livestreams and photos: (a) representing commemoration, (b) displaying affect, (c) regulating respect, and (d) personalizing political imaginaries. Together, these practices illustrate how memory and identity work can spark collective sentiments, encourage political sense-making, and invite discord or social regulation. They also demonstrate how competing politics of memory and identity coincide and clash to envision participatory futures across digital and physical spaces.","[Butkowski, Chelsea P.] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Cornell University,"Butkowski, CP (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Mann Lib, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",cpb96@cornell.edu,,"Butkowski, Chelsea/0000-0001-5593-2487",,,,,50,0,0,5,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",2056-3051,,,SOC MEDIA SOC,Soc.

As citizens value political authenticity, politicians attempt to appear true to themselves in the public eye. However, little research has examined how these perceptions of politicians as more or less authentic are constructed. This study examines how citizens form perceptions of politicians' authenticity and particularly sheds light on the relationship between political media exposure and perceived political authenticity. Drawing on the literature on performed authenticity in social media, personalized media coverage, and information processing, we examine the effects of exposure to political information in different media on perceptions of political authenticity and its subdimensions. Results from an online quota survey in Germany (N = 1,210) show that differences in perceived political authenticity are not simply determined by citizens' political attitudes but can also be explained by their frequency of exposure to political information in different media types. When citizens use private TV news, political accounts on social media, and follow candidate profiles, they perceive politicians as more authentic.

In this article, we propose another tactic utilized by moral entrepreneurs, a concept we refer to as shifting morals. The complexity of moral entrepreneurs' life experiences provides them with an endless set of social and moral norms that they can use to tweak their own ideals to encompass other moral framing networks to gain more followers and thus increase their influence. We examine theoretical literature, while also providing examples that resulted from content analysis from media websites to illustrate our proposed concept of shifting morals. We conclude that the shifting morals tactic is another tool moral entrepreneurs use to increase their influence in society to enact social change.","[Flores-Yeffal, Nadia Y.] Texas Tech Univ, Dept Sociol Anthropol & Social Work, Box 41012,1011 Boston Ave, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA; [Sparger, Kade] Texas Tech Univ, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA",Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University; Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University,"Flores-Yeffal, NY (corresponding author), Texas Tech Univ, Dept Sociol Anthropol & Social Work, Box 41012,1011 Boston Ave, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA.",Nadia.flores@ttu.edu,,"Flores-Yeffal, Nadia Y./0000-0001-8159-5488",,,,,39,0,0,3,3,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",2056-3051,,,SOC MEDIA SOC,Soc.

For young adults in the United States, the rate of death by suicide has increased substantially. The evidence for the effects of social media on mental health are contradictory. However, there is limited research investigating effects of social media usage on suicide ideation. Given the interpersonal nature of social media (SM), we examined the relationship between Instagram, Twitter, and suicidal ideation in the context of the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide in 449 young adults. We found a significant indirect effect of Instagram use on lower suicide ideation through lower perceived burdensomeness. Our results are inconsistent with the literature demonstrating negative mental health effects associated with SM usage. Rather, our results indicate that some SM platforms may be associated with positive mental health outcomes. Our results also demonstrate that different SM platforms may result in differing effects on mental health and interpersonal factors specifically. Future research should examine the content and activities that users engage in while using SM to provide a deeper understanding of these relationships.","[Unruh-Dawes, Emma L.; Smith, Logan M.; Marks, Cassandra P.

Can a study of patterns of gift-giving in online marketplaces further our understanding of the social ties and normative structures underpinning trade? This study suggests that the answer is in the affirmative. Studies of gift-giving in offline markets assert that gifting is predicated on reciprocity and social obligation, and enables the constitution and reproduction of social ties that facilitate trade. This article presents a three-pronged theoretical argument. First, it extends the argument that gifting creates a social space that is open to manipulations and interpretations. Second, it asserts that gift-giving in the online marketplace should be viewed as a particular type of market device, an object that guides market actors how to make sense of their socio-economic actions. Third, the article argues that gifting operates as a conversion device providing buyers and sellers with a flexible material and symbolic resource that allows them to oscillate and convert between distinct moral frameworks that co-exist within the socio-cultural institution of gift-giving. Based on 54 in-depth interviews, this study finds that gifting flourishes around reputation systems, pointing to their central role in the platform economy. The role of gift-giving as a conversion device is developed and discussed, and the way sellers employ it to convert the normative framework depicting reputation systems as rational and calculative, into a framework highlighting reciprocity and obligation.","[Darr, Asaf] Univ Haifa, Dept Sociol, 7017 Rabin Complex,Mt Carmel, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel",University of Haifa,"Darr, A (corresponding author), Univ Haifa, Dept Sociol, 7017 Rabin Complex,Mt Carmel, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel.",adarr@univ.haifa.ac.il,,,Israel Science Foundation [244/13],Israel Science Foundation(Israel Science Foundation),"The author disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study was supported by the Israel Science Foundation, agreement number 244/13.",,73,0,0,0,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",2056-3051,,,SOC MEDIA SOC,Soc.

In an interview study with 27 Canadian adults, participants were shown two infographics about masks and vaccines produced by the World Health Organization (WHO) and asked whether or not they would share these on social media. We find that interviewees' willingness to share the WHO infographics is negotiated against their mental perception of the online audience, which is conceptualized in three distinct ways. First, interviewees who would not share the infographics frequently describe a self-similar audience of peers that are in the know about COVID-19; second, those who might share the infographics conjure a specific and contextual audience who needs the information; and finally, those who said they would share the infographics most frequently conjure an abstract audience of the public or my community to explain that decision.

News is therefore eagerly shared by news media on platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter in the hope of reaching as many news consumers as possible. In this highly competitive media landscape, news media aim to attract consumer attention to these news stories by incorporating the social media logic into their reporting. In this study, we focus specifically on the conversion and accompanying adaptations of news originating from online news sites to the Facebook page of a news medium, with a focus on the (re)formulation of the headline that functions as an important element in both online news articles and Facebook posts. Based on computational analysis, we compare the headlines of news items on the news outlet's website to the headlines published on Facebook and link these with the user engagement metrics (N = 10,579). The findings revealed that the routine of rewriting or adapting headlines on Facebook in contemporary journalism is rather common and that this rewriting is done with an eye toward injecting elements that better align with the social media logic, consequently magnifying its impact on engagement.","[Lamot, Kenza; Kreutz, Tim] Univ Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium; [Opgenhaffen, Michael] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Leuven, Belgium; [Lamot, Kenza] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Antwerp; KU Leuven; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Lamot, K (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Fac Humanities, Commun, De Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",kenzalamot@gmail.com,,,,,,,44,1,1,8,8,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",2056-3051,,,SOC MEDIA SOC,Soc.

Developed by open source communities with non-commercial goals, these platforms can offer more expansive participatory cultures than corporate platforms. However, such platforms also involve new kinds of participatory challenges, such as requiring high technological literacy. This article examines the complexity of enacting participatory cultures by drawing on an ethnographic study of Scuttlebutt, a decentralized social media platform being developed by an open source community. This examination focuses on three key features of participatory culture as enacted on Scuttlebutt: varying modes and sites of participation; reflexivity about who is participating and how; and an evaluation of limits to participation. It also considers the challenges that arise from Scuttlebutt's approach and how these highlight the profound difficulty of trying to enact fuller models of participatory culture. From these findings, we argue that Scuttlebutt provides an important example of the experimentation that alternative social media platforms are conducting around open, democratic modes of socio-technical organizing, and note that this experimentation raises important questions about how we conceptualize participation and the future of social media.","[Mannell, Kate] Deakin Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Digital Child, Burwood, Vic, Australia; [Smith, Eden T.] Univ Melbourne, Sch Hist & Philosoph Studies, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Smith, Eden T.] Univ Melbourne, Interdisciplinary MetaMelb Res Grp, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Deakin University; University of Melbourne; University of Melbourne,"Mannell, K (corresponding author), Deakin Univ, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia.",kate.mannell@deakin.edu.au,,"Smith, Eden/0000-0003-4058-6619",,,,,56,0,0,3,3,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",2056-3051,,,SOC MEDIA SOC,Soc.

We also observed some variations in norm-conforming behaviors among the members of each party. For Republicans, increased loyalty to the Trump leadership was significantly associated with a lower level of mask promotion. For Democrats, we found some evidence that loyalty to the party predicted higher levels of mask promotion. On the other hand, interactions with out-group members decreased adherence to party norms for both Republican and Democratic members of Congress. These findings allow us to better understand the social-psychological effects of party membership among political elites as well as the importance of leader-follower relationships and intergroup interactions.","[Shin, Jieun] Univ Florida, Coll Journalism & Commun, 1885 Stadium Rd, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Yang, Aimei] Univ Southern Calif, Annenberg Sch Commun & Journalism, Publ Relat, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA; [Kim, Hye Min] Univ Southern Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA; [Liu, Wenlin] Univ Houston, Strateg Commun, Houston, TX 77004 USA; [Zhou, Alvin] Univ Penn, Annenberg Sch Commun, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Sun, Jingyi] Stevens Inst Technol, Sch Business, Hoboken, NJ 07030 USA; [Zhou, Alvin] Univ Minnesota, Hubbard Sch Journalism & Mass Commun, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; University of Southern California; University of Southern California; University of Houston System; University of Houston; University of Pennsylvania; Stevens Institute of Technology; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Shin, J (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Coll Journalism & Commun, 1885 Stadium Rd, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",jieun.shin@ufl.edu,"Zhou, Alvin/L-3760-2019","Zhou, Alvin/0000-0001-5410-9712; Shin, Jieun/0000-0001-7416-0240",,,,,64,0,0,4,8,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",2056-3051,,,SOC MEDIA SOC,Soc.

This study focuses on a sample of 64,260 individuals aged 50+ who are resident in Portugal, Greece, Italy, Spain, Denmark, Sweden, Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Switzerland, Luxemburg, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovenia, Estonia, and Croatia and were surveyed in the context of the SHARE project (Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe), Wave 6. The results showed that living alone relates to greater odds of depression. Nevertheless, of particular relevance is that they also evidenced that the Internet has a moderating role on this relationship, revealing a protective role, since Europeans aged 50+ who live alone and are Internet users are less likely to experience depression than other older adults. The findings reinforce the importance of policies aimed at digital inclusion to benefit the mental health of older adults who live alone in Europe.","[Silva, Patricia; Matos, Alice Delerue] Univ Minho, Commun & Soc Res Ctr, Inst Social Sci, Campus Gualtar, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal; [Silva, Patricia] Polytech Inst Viana do Castelo, Sch Educ, Viana Do Castelo, Portugal; [Matos, Alice Delerue] Univ Minho, Dept Sociol, Inst Social Sci, Braga, Portugal; [Martinez-Pecino, Roberto] Univ Seville, Seville, Spain",Universidade do Minho; Polytechnic Institute of Viana do Castelo; Universidade do Minho; University of Sevilla,"Silva, P (corresponding author), Univ Minho, Commun & Soc Res Ctr, Inst Social Sci, Campus Gualtar, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal.",patriciasilva@ics.uminho.pt,"Delerue Matos, Alice/AAC-3838-2020; Martinez-Pecino, Roberto/L-1294-2014","Delerue Matos, Alice/0000-0002-2394-4077; Martinez-Pecino, Roberto/0000-0003-0765-1407; Silva, Patricia/0000-0003-4074-5368","Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation; FCT/MCTES through National Funds (PIDDAC); European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) through the Operational Program PORNorte; PORLisboa [AACN 01/SAICT/2016, 022209 DATALAB]; European Commission [QLK6-CT-2001-00360, SHARE-I3: RII-CT-2006-062193, COMPARE: CIT5-CT-2005-028857, SHARELIFE: CIT4-CT-2006-028812, 211909, 227822, 261982]; Horizon 2020 [676536, 654221]; DG Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion; German Ministry of Education and Research; Max Planck Society for the Advancement of Science; US National Institute on Aging [U01_AG09740-13S2, P01_ AG005842, P01_ AG08291, P30_AG12815, R21_AG025169, Y1-AG-4553-01, IAG_BSR06-11, OGHA_04-064, HHSN271201300071C]","Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation; FCT/MCTES through National Funds (PIDDAC)(Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology); European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) through the Operational Program PORNorte; PORLisboa; European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre); Horizon 2020; DG Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion; German Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Max Planck Society for the Advancement of Science(Max Planck SocietyEuropean Commission); US National Institute on Aging(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA))","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The authors are grateful for the funding awarded to SHARE Portugal by the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation and by FCT/MCTES through National Funds (PIDDAC) and European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) through the Operational Program PORNorte and PORLisboa, AACN 01/SAICT/2016, Application n. 022209 DATALAB.

In this quantitative study, we examined how SMNSU can directly and indirectly influence depression, with loneliness and social anxiety examined as mediator variables. A 39-item questionnaire was used to collect survey data on SMNSU, loneliness, social anxiety, and depression from 244 blended learning undergraduate students from universities in the Hunan province in China. Partial least squares structural equation modeling was conducted using SmartPLS 3.3.3 to measure the relationships between the stated variables of interest. Results indicated that SMNSU has a direct, significant, and positive relationship with depression. In terms of mediating effects, both loneliness and social anxiety have an intervening role in the association between SMNSU and depression. This study focused on the higher education sector of China by recruiting students who were enrolled in blended learning courses during the COVID-19 pandemic and experiencing psychological problems.

These apps play a particularly important role in countries such as India, where being visibly queer can carry social stigma, and same-sex intercourse was criminalized until 2018. A key challenge on these apps is self-disclosing enough information to appear authentic and build trust with other users, without drawing unwanted attention, stigma, and safety threats. Careful consideration of when to share information and what to share is critical, but we have a limited understanding of how users make these decisions. Drawing upon in-depth interviews with 36 queer men in 4 smaller urban environments in and near the state of Maharashtra, India, we sought to understand how queer men think about their visibility while using GSNAs. We find that they are primarily concerned with the visibility of the actual GSNA on their phone, especially given many users in this context live with their families and assumptions common in the West, such as one person per device, may not hold. They also worry about the information they disclose on the app itself given this visibility can lead to dangerous situations. We detail how participants try to resolve the tensions around visibility and discuss our findings in relation to conceptualizations of privacy and signaling theory. We conclude with practical guidelines related to the use of these apps in the Indian context.","[Pinch, Annika] Northwestern Univ, Media Technol & Soc Dept, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Birnholtz, Jeremy] Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Rawat, Shruta; Bhatter, Aakanksha; Baruah, Dicky; Dange, Alpana] Humsafar Trust, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India",Northwestern University; Northwestern University,"Pinch, A (corresponding author), Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",annikapinch2025@u.northwestern.edu,,"Birnholtz, Jeremy/0000-0003-4172-4534",Sexualities Project at Northwestern University,Sexualities Project at Northwestern University,";The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was supported by the Sexualities Project at Northwestern University.",,90,0,0,4,4,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",2056-3051,,,SOC MEDIA SOC,Soc.

Based on a two-wave online panel survey (n = 791) of the adult population of Hong Kong, as one case of a politically polarized society, we examine the degree to which individuals disconnect from those with whom they politically disagree with on social media. The analysis indicates that exposure to disagreement does indeed lead people to filter their information repertoire by disconnecting from those with whom they disagree. A moderated mediation analysis finds that political disagreement indirectly influenced activist participation through information repertoire filtration. However, in contrast to expectations, this effect was stronger when individuals had a lower level of affective polarization.

Drawing on socioemotional selectivity theory, we sought to examine whether older adults' SNS use with different socializing targets (i.e., family vs friends) would differentially predict global, social, and mental well-being outcomes indexed by life satisfaction, loneliness, and depressive symptoms, respectively. Furthermore, we examined whether social support and social strain would mediate, in parallel, the relations between SNS use and well-being outcomes. We recruited healthy, community-dwelling older adults (ages 60-93 years, N= 69). Using the PROCESS macro, we found that SNS use with friends, but not family, predicted poorer life satisfaction and greater loneliness via increased social strain. However, SNS use with neither friends nor family was linked to depressive symptoms. Furthermore, social support failed to account for the relations between SNS use and well-being indices. These results held when we controlled for a host of covariates-age, gender, education level, income, marital status, and overall physical health. Our findings reconcile disparate findings in the literature by elucidating that older adults' SNS use with different socializing targets asymmetrically predicts life satisfaction and loneliness via varying degrees of perceived social strain.","[Tng, Germaine Yue Qi] Singapore Management Univ, Singapore, Singapore; [Yang, Hwajin] Singapore Management Univ, Psychol, Singapore, Singapore",Singapore Management University; Singapore Management University,"Yang, H (corresponding author), Singapore Management Univ, Sch Social Sci, Level 4,90 Stamford Rd, Singapore 178903, Singapore.",hjyang@smu.edu.sg,,"Yang, Hwajin/0000-0002-0762-7194",Lee Kong Chian fellowship; Ministry of Education Academic Research Fund Tier 1 [17-C242-SMU-008],Lee Kong Chian fellowship; Ministry of Education Academic Research Fund Tier 1,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was supported by a Lee Kong Chian fellowship and a grant awarded to Hwajin Yang by Singapore Management University through a research grant (17-C242-SMU-008) from the Ministry of Education Academic Research Fund Tier 1.",,100,0,0,21,22,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",2056-3051,,,SOC MEDIA SOC,Soc.

While research has begun unpacking the implications of such attacks, little attention has been paid toward avenues to counter them. Drawing upon the literature on misinformation and crisis management research and through an experimental survey (n = 1,460), this study explores strategies that media outlets can employ to protect themselves against unwarranted fake news accusations-specifically through various denial and attack responses. Results show that denial strategies significantly increase respondents' belief in the initial critical report, increase support of the media while conversely decreasing support of the politician. While variants of more offensive attack strategies also led to these anticipated effects, simple denials were found to be more effective in protecting the legitimacy of the media outlet. This suggests that such strategies can constitute a simple first-level measure through which institutions can undertake to challenge unfounded fake news accusations.","[Neo, Ric] Univ Hong Kong HKU, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",University of Hong Kong,"Neo, R (corresponding author), Univ Hong Kong HKU, Dept Polit & Publ Adm, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",ricneo@hku.hk,,"Neo, Ric/0000-0002-6418-4350",,,,,60,1,1,3,4,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",2056-3051,,,SOC MEDIA SOC,Soc.

Since then, much of the public discourse has been on developing effective strategies to combat the spread of misinformation online. While several studies have focused on the effects of a mixed/hybrid regime of information channels on political participation and campaigns, we know little about how the existence of a hybrid media system exposes people to misinformation during an election cycle. Using a nationally representative survey administered during the 2019 Indonesian election (N= 1,820), we find evidence for the prominence of traditional media as well as face-to-face discussions: political use of traditional media such as newspapers and TV as well as sharing of political information through face-to-face discussions are found to be positively associated with at least one measure of misinformation exposure. As for the social media communicative pathways, only political use of WhatsApp and Instagram are found to be positively associated with misinformation exposure; that no similar effects are observed for Facebook and Twitter attests, to some extent, to the efficacy of strategies aimed at combating misinformation implemented on such platforms. By considering social media, traditional media, and face-to-face communication in a context of a less digitalized hybrid media environment, this article provides a more comprehensive framework and novel empirical data to study misinformation exposure beyond the context of Western democracies.","[Neyazi, Taberez Ahmed] Natl Univ Singapore, Polit Commun & New Media, Singapore 119260, Singapore; [Neyazi, Taberez Ahmed; Kuru, Ozan] Natl Univ Singapore, Ctr Trusted Internet & Community, Singapore 119260, Singapore; [Kuru, Ozan] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Commun & New Media, Singapore 119260, Singapore; [Ng, Aaron Yi Kai] Singapore Inst Technol, Business Commun & Design Cluster, Singapore, Singapore; [Muhtadi, Burhanuddin] State Islamic Univ Syarif Hidayatullah Jakarta, Jakarta, Indonesia",National University of Singapore; National University of Singapore; National University of Singapore; Singapore Institute of Technology; Universitas Islam Negeri Syarif Hidayatullah Jakarta,"Neyazi, TA (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, Singapore 119260, Singapore.",taberez@nus.edu.sg; aaron.ng@u.nus.edu; okuru@nus.edu.sg; burhanuddin.mubtadi@uinjkt.ac.id,"Muhtadi, Burhanuddin/GMW-6776-2022; Neyazi, Taberez/B-7245-2008","Muhtadi, Burhanuddin/0000-0002-6043-6856; Neyazi, Taberez/0000-0001-8695-1007",,,,,70,0,0,3,3,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",2056-3051,,,SOC MEDIA SOC,Soc.

Using the contemporary internet routinely involves relying on a small number of dominant corporate platforms. In reaction against this centralization of power, there are many attempts to build alternative Web technologies that reconfigure the internet's power structures and enact their own values. However, given the entrenchment of large corporate platforms, this typically involves co-existing with rather than replacing them, at least in the present. Accordingly, it is important to investigate challenges arising when alternative social media operate alongside and even within the systems to which they propose an alternative. We investigate this through an empirical study of the IndieWeb, a community of personal websites with social networking features including syndication to and from corporate platforms. Using GitHub data, we study the development of a tool for this syndication called Bridgy, focusing on its relationship with the Facebook API. By identifying breakdowns in this relationship, we identify the following challenges: translating differing logics between the open Web and APIs, occasional ambiguity in Facebook's presentation of privacy settings, and ongoing precarity due to API updates. Our analysis illustrates the reality of maintaining alternative technical systems as part of present-day infrastructures and generates insights for building socially empowering technologies for the future.","[Jamieson, Jack; Yamashita, Naomi] NTT Commun Sci Labs, 2-4 Hikaridai, Kyoto 6190237, Japan; [Jamieson, Jack; McEwen, Rhonda] Univ Toronto Mississauga, Mississauga, ON, Canada",Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corporation; University of Toronto; University Toronto Mississauga,"Jamieson, J (corresponding author), NTT Commun Sci Labs, 2-4 Hikaridai, Kyoto 6190237, Japan.",jack@jackjamieson.net,,"Jamieson, Jack/0000-0002-8444-5722",Social Science and Humanities Research Council Canada Graduate Scholarship,Social Science and Humanities Research Council Canada Graduate Scholarship,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was supported by a Social Science and Humanities Research Council Canada Graduate Scholarship, 2015-2018.",,55,0,0,1,2,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",2056-3051,,,SOC MEDIA SOC,Soc.

In contrast, this study compares subjective authenticity perceptions within users and between self-presentations via two SNS features-Stories vs Posts. Drawing on the affordances approach, we theorize and test whether and how Stories produce greater state authenticity than Posts. Results from a preregistered within-subjects study comparing self-reports on N=489 Posts and N=546 Stories from N= 202 Instagram users show that by allowing more spontaneous self-presentation, Stories indeed produced (slightly) higher authenticity perceptions than Posts.

Racist opinions can be disguised through a language that may appear to be harmless; however, it can be part of a racist rhetoric toward communities of color. This type of racist communication is called Ambient Digital Racism (ADR). Through a thematic analysis, this project sought to identify and analyze social media racist discourses on Twitter in the context of George Floyd's death. This research examined original tweets posted during the time of the protests using three known counter Black Lives Matter (BLM) hashtags, namely, #WhiteLivesMatter, #BlueLivesMatter, and #AllLivesMatter. After the analysis, two themes emerged, namely, the discourse of oppressor's reverse racism and the social criminalization of BLM. These themes described the narratives used by these groups to develop a racist digital discourse that goes unnoticed by social media regulations and policies and that leaves an open space to negotiate what constitutes acceptable race talk and what constitutes a racist discourse. It was found that both themes were grounded on White victimization, color-blind racism, and the dehumanization of BLM as a social and racial justice movement.","[Agudelo, Felipe, I] Simmons Univ, Dept Publ Hlth, 300 Fenway, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Olbrych, Natalie] Simmons Univ, Boston, MA 02115 USA",Simmons University; Simmons University,"Agudelo, FI (corresponding author), Simmons Univ, Dept Publ Hlth, 300 Fenway, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",agudelof@simmons.edu,,,,,,,51,0,0,6,6,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",2056-3051,,,SOC MEDIA SOC,Soc.

Eight items measuring sarcasm in trolling were written to develop a Likert type of scale. In total, 809 university students participated in the study and completed an online questionnaire. Findings suggested that both the sarcastic trolling scale and the Turkish version of the Troll Deviancy Scales are valid and reliable. Analyses showed that there were significant associations among trolling measures. Moreover, the differential predictive value of dark personality traits and overt and relational aggression in different forms of trolling were revealed. This study extends the existing literature on linking personality traits and aggression to a new form of trolling.

Although some protest music is used solely to bring attention to the evils of an oppressive group, another purpose it may serve is to foster positive self-definition and feelings of unity in communities of oppressed people, and some songs may even do both. This project aimed to explore how TikTok affords expression and connection in relation to the use of and interaction with protest music in online spaces. A critical discourse analysis of a specific case of TikTok protest music, You About To Lose Yo Job, was conducted through the lenses of personal expression as a feature of connective action and affordance theory. The following three themes emerged: lip-syncing as a tool of defiance and reclamation of space, the use of hashtags to game a commercialized platform, and the decontextualization or loss of essence of protest music. These findings indicated that the social and ideological functions served by protest music as background sounds on TikTok created potential new avenues for agency through spatial defiance afforded by green screens and strategies to amplify users' content to new audiences. However, dominant ideologies of capitalism were also reinforced through gaming of hashtags that were associated with events and trends of culture, diluting the context and blurring the movement affiliation of users, making unclear the function the protest music may serve.","[Sadler, Olivia] Univ Illinois, 1007 W Harrison St, Chicago, IL 60607 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital,"Sadler, O (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, 1007 W Harrison St, Chicago, IL 60607 USA.",osadle2@uic.edu,,"Sadler, Olivia/0000-0001-6753-2608",,,,,46,0,0,10,11,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",2056-3051,,,SOC MEDIA SOC,Soc.

Much of the existing literature on this question views moderation as a series of decision-making tasks and evaluates moderation algorithms based on their accuracy. Drawing on literature from the field of platform governance, I argue that content moderation is more than a series of discrete decisions but rather a complex system of rules, mechanism, and procedures. Research must therefore articulate how automated moderation alters the broader regime of governance on a platform. To demonstrate this, I report on the findings of a qualitative study on the Reddit bot AutoModerator, using interviews and trace ethnography. I find that the scale of the bot allows moderators to carefully manage the visibility of content and content moderation on Reddit, fundamentally transforming the basic rules of governance on the platform.","[Wright, Lucas] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Cornell University,"Wright, L (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",law323@cornell.edu,,,,,,,43,0,0,13,13,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",2056-3051,,,SOC MEDIA SOC,Soc.

The findings of a survey of 797 students to track differences in perceptions of specific types of uncivil speech show that political incivility consists of a three-dimensional concept, that is, incivility as impoliteness, as individual delegitimization, and as institutional delegitimization.

While a lot of focus has been placed on affective politics as mechanisms for governance, little has been done regarding affective polarization after feminist protest. In this article, we bridge two bodies of literature-affective politics and political polarization-by proposing the notion of affective polarization. We focused on the case of a series of feminist mobilizations that took place to fight back against the impunity of police violence in Mexico. We conducted a mixed-method approach that combines, on one hand, quantitative analysis of data strand tweets encompassing #EllasNoMeRepresentan (TheyDoNotRepresentMe) (N= 17,698) and #EllasSiMeRepresentan (TheyDoRepresentMe) (N = 67 00) and, on the other hand, a qualitative analysis of 500 tweets of each hashtag. The results of the study revealed the existence of polarization that aims at disciplining the affective political participation of women. Almost half of our data contain negative sentiments. The toxic tweets include corrective threats, such as incitation to sexual violence, murder, hate against feminism, and patronizing discourses about how women should protest. We thus conclude that while it is true that social media has amplified feminist mobilization, it has also led to an increase of digital violence. With these findings, the article contributes to a better understanding of both feminist affective politics and its disciplining governing mechanisms in a patriarchal social media.","[Estrada, Marcela Suarez] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Latin Amer Studies, Polit Sci, Berlin, Germany; [Juarez, Yulissa; Pina-Garcia, C.

Results show that perceived social support via WeChat not only positively impacted empathy but also interacted with anxiety in influencing the degree to which participants could maintain empathy toward others. Those living in cities or towns with higher incomes were more empathetic to others.

In this experiment, we investigated the effects of disinformation (contrasted to both similar and dissimilar authentic political speeches), the role of modality (textual manipulation versus a deepfake), and the disinformation's embedding on social media (absent, endorsed or discredited by an (in)authentic citizen). Our main findings indicate that deepfakes are less credible than authentic news on the same topic. Deepfakes are not more persuasive than textual disinformation. Although we did find that disinformation has effects on the perceived credibility and source evaluations of people who tend to agree with the stance of the disinformation's arguments, our findings suggest that the strong societal concerns on deepfakes' destabilizing impact on democracy are not completely justified.","[Hameleers, Michael; van der Meer, Toni G.

Consistent with the theory, an online survey of Twitter users (n= 1,060) found that instrumental and experiential attitudes and descriptive and injunctive subjective norms regarding these behaviors were direct predictors of intentions. Perceived behavioral control had a moderating effect, such that subjective norm was a better predictor of intentions for participants high as opposed to low in perceived control.

However, it remains unclear how the APIs of leading social media relate to platform governance and how this relationship evolved. This article traces the evolution of Facebook's APIs, which evolved from a relatively simple programming interface for data access into a complex layered and interconnected governance arrangement. The study draws on a large corpus of (archived) developer pages and API reference documentation to examine the history of Facebook's API governance; that is, the governance of and by Facebook through its APIs. This historical analysis emphasizes the technical dimensions and dynamics of what, how, and whom powerful platforms seek to govern, thus highlighting the technicity of platform governance and how it evolved. Because APIs facilitate and govern the material conditions of app development and the social and economic processes they sustain, powerful platforms influence the evolution of their larger ecosystems. As such, the technicity of Facebook's API governance represents a major source of the platform's infrastructural power.","[van der Vlist, Fernando N.] Univ Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands; [van der Vlist, Fernando N.] Univ Siegen, Collaborat Res Ctr Media Cooperat, Herrengarten 3, D-57072 Siegen, Germany; [Burkhardt, Marcus; Seitz, Tatjana] Univ Siegen, Siegen, Germany; [Helmond, Anne] Univ Amsterdam, New Media & Digital Culture, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Utrecht University; Universitat Siegen; Universitat Siegen; University of Amsterdam,"van der Vlist, FN (corresponding author), Univ Siegen, Collaborat Res Ctr Media Cooperat, Herrengarten 3, D-57072 Siegen, Germany.",fernando.vandervlist@uni-siegen.de,"van der Vlist, Fernando N./GVS-1267-2022","van der Vlist, Fernando N./0000-0003-1401-0325; Helmond, Anne/0000-0003-4327-4012",Center for Advanced internet Studies (CAIS),Center for Advanced internet Studies (CAIS),"The authors thanks angeles Briones (DensityDesign Lab, Polytechnic University of Milan) for information visualization assistance during the research process, and the Center for Advanced internet Studies (CAIS) for funding and hosting our working group.

To lower the risk of health misinformation, fact-checking matters. However, most existing studies investigated fact-checking from the journalism angle, while little is known about how information-seekers' social media use affects their fact-checking behaviors. Also, it remains unclear how individuals' health worry is associated with health fact-checking. Based on the O-S-O-R model, this study explored the underlying mechanism through which health worry and social media might hinder users' fact-checking. Specifically, with a two-wave panel survey conducted in China during the COVID-19 pandemic, this study showed that individuals' worry about COVID-19 increased social media information overload, which resulted in social media fatigue that could reduce health fact-checking. Also, the direct relationship between worry and fact-checking was not significant, but was completely mediated by social media information overload and social media fatigue. The findings demonstrate the negative roles of worry and social media in inhibiting users' fact-checking behaviors. Important theoretical and practical implications for promoting effective factchecking are discussed.","[Jiang, Shaohai] Natl Univ Singapore, Commun, Singapore, Singapore",National University of Singapore,"Jiang, SH (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Commun & New Media, Blk AS6,03-41,11 Comp Dr, Singapore 117416, Singapore.",cnmjs@nus.edu.sg,,,,,,,71,0,0,55,55,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",2056-3051,,,SOC MEDIA SOC,Soc.

However, rather than making users feel more connected to others, social media may cause negative mental health and relational outcomes, including a fear of missing out (FoMO). Against the backdrop of the global coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic, this health communication study sought to understand the impact of physical and emotional isolation (i.e., prescribed social isolation) on people as we turned to social media more frequently. As the pandemic wore on, many remained online, watching people they knew returning to normal, potentially creating high levels of FoMO despite disagreeing with others' decisions. This study examines whether social media use (frequency and purpose) influences individuals' perception of the acceptability of others' behavior, and whether those perceptions impact individuals' own behavioral decisions. Participants (N = 459) from the United States were recruited from late 2021 to early 2022 to complete an anonymous online survey regarding the acceptableness of behavior shown in posts by friends and family. Results indicated that increased social media frequency was correlated with an increased sense of FoMO, which was significantly and positively associated with favorable perceptions of others' behaviors, such as gathering indoors with others, even when public health officials discouraged it. However, FoMO was not significantly related to users' personal intentions to follow public health recommendations. A post hoc analysis determined that fear of COVID-19 moderated the relationship between FoMO and the perception of others' behavior, as well as the relationship between FoMO and behavioral intentions.","[Scheinfeld, Emily] Kennesaw State Univ, Commun & Media, 402 Bartow Ave,MD 2207, Kennesaw, GA 30144 USA; [Voorhees, Heather L.] Univ Montana, Missoula, MT 59812 USA",University System of Georgia; Kennesaw State University; University of Montana System; University of Montana,"Scheinfeld, E (corresponding author), Kennesaw State Univ, Commun & Media, 402 Bartow Ave,MD 2207, Kennesaw, GA 30144 USA.",escheinf@kennesaw.edu,,,,,,,51,0,0,11,11,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",2056-3051,,,SOC MEDIA SOC,Soc.

How can designers create systems to earn and maintain public trust in large-scale online research? Procedural theories inform processes that enable individuals to make decisions about their participation. Substantive theories focus on the normative judgments that researchers and participants make about specific studies in context. Informed by these theories, we designed Bartleby, a system for debriefing participants and eliciting their views about studies that involved them. We evaluated this system by using it to debrief thousands of participants in a series of observational and experimental studies on Twitter and Reddit. We find that Bartleby addresses procedural concerns by creating new opportunities for study participants to exercise autonomy. We also find that participants use Bartleby to contribute to substantive, value-driven conversations about participant voice and power. We conclude with a critical reflection on the strengths and limitations of reusable software to satisfy values from both procedural and substantive ethical theories.","[Zong, Jonathan] MIT, Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Matias, J.

In particular, the author situates and interrogates Okayplayer as a dwelling space where self-identified Black identities developed digital voices and a communal ethic of acknowledgment. Indeed, 5 years before Facebook, and 7 years before Twitter; Okayplayer was a social media precursor-made for and by black folks. Prior to social media era, the OKP message boards were the rare space where black digital voices could be heard and acknowledged by peers and fellow recording artists such as Erykah Badu-a digital home or dwelling space. In this essay, I sample and extend Hyde's redefinition of ethos as home; to online communities of color. Hence, this essay retrospectively examines OKP's digital ethos as a cultural communal co-production where discourse is used to transform space and time into dwelling places where people can deliberate about and know together some matter of interest (p. xiii). By viewing OKP as discursive site, the paper interrogates the function of rhetorical voice in establishing dwelling spaces. My critical lens is informed by Mitra and Watts advocacy of marginalized digital voice. Voice is actualized as an architectural event, only when it is acknowledged. In relation to OKP, Watts contends that historically, Black voices that find acknowledgment develop a dwelling place based on  a sort of collaboration..as a kind of magic by a communal will.","[Hardy, Antoine] Borough Manhattan Community Coll, Dept Speech Commun & Theater Arts, New York, NY 10007 USA",,"Hardy, A (corresponding author), Borough Manhattan Community Coll, Dept Speech Commun & Theater Arts, New York, NY 10007 USA.",antoine.hardy@gmail.com,,,,,,,73,0,0,0,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",2056-3051,,,SOC MEDIA SOC,Soc.

She added that after being hooked up with the best brother on the plantation by her massa, she would be popping out superbabies every 9 months. Although the show is known for testing the limits of comedy and poking fun at everything, Jones was criticized for making light of such a serious topic. In early 2018, however, Black Twitter picked up right where Jones left off and slavery became a topic of amusement online. Using words, gifs, memes, and videos, users reimagined the lives of enslaved African Americans during the 1600s in a comical manner. This online exchange was marked by the #TweetLikeThe1600s hashtag and went in a series of directions. In what follows, I locate the hashtag in a longer tradition of Black humor as well as analyze subsequent discussions about who is allowed in on the joke.

These tools allow journalists to pursue stronger, more intimate connections with their audiences, to cultivate their own professional identities or brands, and to advocate for improved working conditions within their organizations. Yet, social media platforms have also created new risks and challenges for journalists, most notably in the form of dark participation, which refers to negative, selfish or even deeply sinister forms of online audience engagement. Although scholars have devoted considerable effort to exploring how this harassment unfolds and how it impacts journalists who face it, there is less research investigating the implications of this harassment for the future of journalism and its relationship with the public. To address this, this research uses interviews with a diverse group of 37 US journalists to propose larger structural changes to newsroom leadership and social media policy creation. The interview data suggest that newsroom leadership must become more diverse so that newsroom policy is assembled by a group of people that is representative of its staff-as well as the public at large. The authors conclude by observing that dark participation is not unique to journalism alone, and by discussing the implications of our findings for communication stakeholders invested in overcoming the current, global climate of populism that frequently results in hate, harassment, and hostility within social media.","[Miller, Kaitlin C.] Univ Alabama, 432A Reese Phifer Hall, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA; [Nelson, Jacob L.] Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ USA; [Nelson, Jacob L.] Univ Utah, Salt Lake City, UT USA",University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah,"Miller, KC (corresponding author), Univ Alabama, 432A Reese Phifer Hall, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA.",kcmiller6@ua.edu,,"Miller, Kaitlin/0000-0003-1368-0351",,,,,43,0,0,2,2,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",2056-3051,,,SOC MEDIA SOC,Soc.

My explicit interests are in the performances of far-right masculinity at work in this metapolitical project. Consequently, the article makes both empirical and theoretical contributions to the field. Empirically, the study provides a digital ethnography of the manner in which far-right performances of masculinity consolidate digital fraternities around a shared transnational far-right ethos of the underdog us. In so doing, they exploit Web2.0 sociotechnical affordances, presenting their capability of skillfully weaponizing the digital landscape for their metapolitical project. These performances of masculinity aim to re-naturalize the domination, hierarchy, and privilege of White cis heterosexual masculinities across such intersectional axes of inequality as gender, sexuality, race, and social class. This is underpinned by a syncretic theoretical construct, at the heart of which lies the concept of masculinity of crises, buttressed by a superordinate intersectionality perspective. This combination enables a more sophisticated analysis of Web2.0 sociotechnical affordances, highlighting the intersectional underpinnings of the co-constitutive dynamic between far-right performances of masculinity and crises.","[Norocel, Ov Cristian] Lund Univ, Gender Studies, Lund, Sweden",Lund University,"Norocel, OC (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Dept Gender Studies, Box 117, S-22100 Lund, Sweden.",ov_cristian.norocel@genus.lu.se,"Norocel, Ov Cristian/C-3112-2011","Norocel, Ov Cristian/0000-0002-7349-4000",Swedish Research Council (Vetenskapsradet) [2019-03363],Swedish Research Council (Vetenskapsradet)(Swedish Research Council),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Work for this study was supported by the Swedish Research Council (Vetenskapsradet) (2019-03363).",,68,0,0,3,3,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",2056-3051,,,SOC MEDIA SOC,Soc.

Research investigating the effect of sharing photos on a social media user's social connectedness, loneliness, and well-being has generated conflicting results. This study analyzed the effect of Instagram photo sharing on the relationships among social connectedness, loneliness, and well-being. The study focused on photos sharing separate to viewing photos to understand the specific effect of photo sharing. The research measured how those with transient and chronic levels of loneliness respond differently to photo sharing, which has not been previously considered. Well-being and loneliness are conceptualized as dependent variables that have a relationship with social connectedness as an independent variable, which is moderated by the number of photos shared. Results from an online survey of 373 participants found Instagram photo sharing does significantly moderate relationships among social connectedness, loneliness, and well-being. Highest levels of photo sharing were found to have the largest moderating effect. Levels of well-being decreased as social connectedness and photo sharing increased. Differences were found for types of loneliness where photo sharing was most beneficial at low levels of social connectedness for transient loneliness. In contrast, for those experiencing chronic trait loneliness, high levels of photo sharing were associated with highest levels of loneliness when social connectedness was high. One obvious implication for social media and policy may lie in education for users and technology enhancement for optimal photo sharing levels that minimize loneliness and maximize well-being.","[Maclean, Julie; Al-Saggaf, Yeslam; Hogg, Rachel] Charles Sturt Univ, Informat Technol, Wagga Wagga, NSW, Australia",Charles Sturt University,"Maclean, J (corresponding author), Charles Sturt Univ, Wagga Wagga, NSW 2678, Australia.",julie195195@gmail.com,,"Hogg, Rachel/0000-0002-2844-8064",,,,,56,0,0,19,19,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",2056-3051,,,SOC MEDIA SOC,Soc.

Subthemes nested beneath perpetrator identity included whether the perpetrator was known, as well as perpetrator gender identity. Subthemes nested beneath perpetrator tactic included the presence of multiple perpetrators, whether the assault was a crime of opportunity, engagement in physical aggression, utilization of psychological abuse, perpetration of sexual abuse, substance use at the time of the assault (victim and/or perpetrator), whether the abuse persisted, and whether the perpetrator used a weapon.

We found that both misinformation and debunking messages use a substantial amount of group identity languages when discussing the controversial science issue, which we define as science factionalism-discussion about science is divided by factions that are formed upon science attitudes. We found that posts that use science factionalism receive more digital votes and comments, even among the science-savvy community in China.

College students in the United States were introduced to a social media platform described as featuring either non-permanent or permanent content. Results showed participants in the non-permanent (vs. permanent) condition were more likely to believe they would remain anonymous. People who believed they could remain anonymous were in turn less likely to believe they would face consequences of anonymous cyber bullying. In addition, normative beliefs about cyber bullying were related to beliefs about facing retaliation and family disapproval. Overall, this study disentangles different concepts related to anonymity and provides causal evidence that a unique feature in digital spaces-content permanency-can impact perceptions of anonymity, which are in turn correlated with factors known to influence cyber bullying intentions.","[Yu, Muheng] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Commun, 469 Kerr Hall,One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Riddle, Karyn] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Strateg Commun, Sch Journalism & Mass Commun, Madison, WI USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Yu, MH (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Commun, 469 Kerr Hall,One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",muhyu@ucdavis.edu,,,,,,,61,0,0,8,11,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",2056-3051,,,SOC MEDIA SOC,Soc.

Is it the kind of problematic media use that takes over one's life or just habitual ritualized use characterized by mindless scrolling? How can we differentiate between the two based on the use of Instagram features and perceived gratifications from the technology itself? Drawing on the theoretical framework of Uses and Gratifications (U&G) and U&G 2.0, we conducted a survey study (N = 482) to answer these questions. Our findings show that habitual Instagram use is positively related to the use of lurking- and connection-related features and the gratification of play. By contrast, problematic Instagram use is positively correlated with the use of broadcasting-related features and the gratification of novelty. Theoretical implications for differentiating problematic from habitual Instagram use and practical implications for designing ethical interfaces, which consider the digital well-being of users, are discussed.","[Chen, Cheng] Elon Univ, Commun Design, Sch Commun, Elon, NC 27244 USA; [Cohen, Olivia; Sundar, S.

In this study, I conducted 21 semi-structured, in-depth interviews with individuals who engaged in eight different Black feminist hashtag conversations across Twitter and Instagram to expand our current understanding of how Black feminist intellectual production has developed and broadened through the affordances of social media. Findings suggest that while Black feminist hashtag discussions have allowed Black women to talk back to hegemonic mainstream and popular discourses about Black women, these conversations are constantly at stake of appropriation and co-optation replicating historical erasure of Black women's intellectual production.","[Peterson-Salahuddin, Chelsea] Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Northwestern University,"Peterson-Salahuddin, C (corresponding author), Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",chelseapeterson-salahuddin2022@u.northwestern.edu,,"Peterson-Salahuddin, Chelsea/0000-0001-7006-3259",,,,,51,0,0,2,3,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",2056-3051,,,SOC MEDIA SOC,Soc.

Aesthetics of otherness is the result of the interaction between platform users' selections and platform affordances that creates a gap between the marginalized other and the user. Based on a qualitative content analysis of posts with the hashtags #caravanamigrante and #migrantcaravan, this research reveals that the two hashtags form parallel, although not alike, communicative spaces where migrant caravan representation is mostly mediated by professionals and organizations interested in promoting their own work and not by the migrants themselves. Despite this trend, users posting with #caravanamigrante were less likely to hijack the intent of the public, more likely to reference reasons for migration, and overall less likely to employ the aesthetics of otherness, which point to the possibility of circumventing the role of the platform in shaping the representation of marginalized people and social justice movements.","[Rosa, Fernanda R.] Virginia Tech, Sci Technol & Soc, 280 Alumni Mall,321 Lane Hall, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Soto-Vasquez, Arthur D.] Texas A&M Int Univ, Commun, Laredo, TX USA",Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M International University,"Rosa, FR (corresponding author), Virginia Tech, Sci Technol & Soc, 280 Alumni Mall,321 Lane Hall, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",fernandarosa@riseup.net,,,,,,,59,0,0,1,1,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",2056-3051,,,SOC MEDIA SOC,Soc.

Yet while such social media conversations reflect existing tensions in the offline world, the same discourse has also become a target for information operations aiming to heighten social divisions. This article examines Twitter discussions of racism in the first and sixth months since COVID-19 was accorded pandemic status by the World Health Organization and uncovers dynamic associations with bot activity and hate speech. Humans initially constituted the most hateful accounts in online conversations about racism in March, but in August, bots dominated hate speech. Over time, greater bot activity likewise amplified levels of hate speech a week later. Moreover, while discourse about racism in March primarily featured an organic focus on racial identities like Asian and Chinese, we further observed a bot-dominated focus in August toward political identities like president, Democrat, and Republican. Although hate speech targeting Asian groups remained present among racism discussions in August, these findings suggest a bot-fueled redirection from focusing on racial groups at the onset of the pandemic to targeting politics closer to the 2020 US elections. This work enhances understanding of the complexity of racism discussions during the pandemic, its vulnerability to manipulation through information operations, and the large-scale quantitative study of inorganic hate campaigns in online social networks.","[Uyheng, Joshua] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Ctr Computat Anal Social & Org Syst CASOS, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Bellutta, Daniele] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Inst Software Res, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Carley, Kathleen M.] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Inst Software Res, Comp Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA",Carnegie Mellon University; Carnegie Mellon University; Carnegie Mellon University,"Uyheng, J (corresponding author), Carnegie Mellon Univ, Inst Software Res, CASOS Ctr, 5000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",juyheng@cs.cmu.edu,"Uyheng, Joshua/N-6269-2018","Uyheng, Joshua/0000-0002-1631-6566","Knight Foundation; Office of Naval Research (ONR) [N000141812106, N000141812108]; Center for Computational Analysis of Social and Organizational Systems (CASOS); Center for Informed Democracy and Social Cybersecurity (IDeaS)",Knight Foundation; Office of Naval Research (ONR)(Office of Naval Research); Center for Computational Analysis of Social and Organizational Systems (CASOS); Center for Informed Democracy and Social Cybersecurity (IDeaS),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported in part by the Knight Foundation and the Office of Naval Research (ONR) Grants N000141812106 and N000141812108.

In the spirit of documenting Black digital cultures, this article concludes with a conversation with founder Ikem Onyekwena, the Phi Beta Sigma photographer and tech entrepreneur who founded InDmix.com in 2004.","[Conley, Tara L.] Kent State Univ, Sch Media & Journalism, Kent, OH 44240 USA",University System of Ohio; Kent State University; Kent State University Kent; Kent State University Salem,"Conley, TL (corresponding author), Kent State Univ, Kent, OH 44240 USA.",tconle10@kent.edu,,"Conley, Tara/0000-0002-9725-7210",,,,,28,0,0,1,1,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",2056-3051,,,SOC MEDIA SOC,Soc.

Communication technologies enable the emergence of this digital lifestyle that is characterized by high mobility, selfefficacy, location-independent resource-sharing, and minimalism. The immediate outcome of the Covid-19 pandemic created an unprecedented space for debate between the DN community and the mainstream. On the one hand, the mainstream recognized the adaptive advantages of location independence and working remotely; on the other, DNs realized that one of their most fundamental values-the freedom to move-could become compromised by stringent border regulations forcing them to reassess nomadism. This article draws on risk society theories, Maslow's hierarchy of needs and self-actualization, to approach this problem. We Analyzed content produced by DN creators on YouTube, focusing on risk perceptions and arguments about the choice of staying nomad, compared with the alternative, that is, going back home seeking safety: (1) we found that most creators upheld core DN values, rather than shifting to fear-based or risk-control narratives driven by the effects of the pandemic. The narratives circulated in the videos thus contributed to reinforce the community's values related to self-actualization, in a time of crisis; (2) as a group, the creators we studied were not biased to one option (keep moving or go home) and rather offered strong arguments to support either choice.","[Ehn, Karine; Jorge, Ana; Marques-Pita, Manuel] Univ Lusofona, CICANT, Campo Grande 388, P-1700097 Lisbon, Portugal",Lusofona University,"Marques-Pita, M (corresponding author), Univ Lusofona, CICANT, Campo Grande 388, P-1700097 Lisbon, Portugal.",manuel.pita@ulusofona.pt,"Jorge, Ana/N-2163-2019","Jorge, Ana/0000-0002-4069-6212; Marques Pita, Manuel/0000-0003-2180-6823; Ehn, Karine/0000-0002-4872-8688",Portuguese Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia (FCT) [UI/BD/151501/2021],Portuguese Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia (FCT)(Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Karine Ehn acknowledges funding by the Portuguese Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia (FCT), PhD grant UI/BD/151501/2021.",,51,0,0,17,19,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",2056-3051,,,SOC MEDIA SOC,Soc.

In this study, we explore which citizenship norms people express related to their political participation in social media environments and which affordances and experiences in social media environments shape these norms. Through interviews and focus group discussions, we found that citizenship norms emerge in response to positive and negative experiences in social media environments. We found three groups of norms that are distinctive to the networked environments of social media: individual information care, discourse care, and considered contribution. These can serve as conceptual frames for understanding the normative underpinnings of discursive participation in social media environments from the perspective of ordinary citizens.","[Gagrcin, Emilija; Porten-Chee, Pablo; Leissner, Laura; Emmer, Martin] Free Univ Berlin, Weizenbaum Inst Networked Soc, Berlin, Germany; [Porten-Chee, Pablo] Heidelberg Univ, Commun Studies & Informat Soc Ibero Amer, Heidelberg, Germany; [Jorring, Louise] Copenhagen Business Sch, Frederiksberg, Denmark",Free University of Berlin; Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg; Copenhagen Business School,"Emmer, M (corresponding author), Free Univ Berlin, Weizenbaum Inst Networked Soc, Inst Media & Commun Studies, Garystr 55, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.",martin.emmer@fu-berlin.de,,"Emmer, Martin/0000-0002-0722-132X; Gagrcin, Emilija/0000-0002-2953-1871",Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung [16DII114],Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung 16DII114.",,71,1,1,7,11,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",2056-3051,,,SOC MEDIA SOC,Soc.

Questioning how journalists depict reality is important especially in an age of economic and technological uncertainty. A new group of media actors involved in the news cycles is increasingly able to hack the attention economy; non-elite actors by the algorithmic logics of platforms tend to be increasingly regarded as influential (if not authoritative) in journalists' decisions to transform facts into news. This study explores how in the various phases of newsmaking (i.e., discovering, gathering, spreading, and verifying news) non-elite actors are shaping journalists' everyday epistemology in the contemporary Italian hybrid media system. This study draws on an analysis of 147 semi-structured interviews conducted with Italian professional journalists from 2008 to 2020. The results of the analysis confirmed the most conventional view about Italian journalism, that is, that journalists present knowledge essentially by using elite actors' subjective reconstructions of reality. The integration of non-elite sources in the various stages of news production is due to an attitude of journalists aimed not so much at increasing pluralism as at producing news by providing evidence. The low level of journalists' reflexivity in the use of web platforms, while involving some non-elite actors, appears to favor platforms themselves and their requisites.","[Splendore, Sergio] Univ Milan, Media Sociol, Milan, Italy; [Iannelli, Laura] Univ Sassari, Sociol Culture & Commun, Sassari, Italy",University of Milan; University of Sassari,"Splendore, S (corresponding author), Univ Milan, Dept Social & Polit Sci, Via Conservatorio 7, I-20122 Milan, Italy.",sergio.splendore@unimi.it,,"SPLENDORE, SERGIO/0000-0001-5324-4496",Italian Ministry of Research and University [20175HFEB3]; University of Sassari,"Italian Ministry of Research and University(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)); University of Sassari","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the Italian Ministry of Research and University under the PRIN research program (National Projects of Relevant Interest, 2017) (Grant Number: 20175HFEB3); by the University of Sassari under the University Fund for Research 2020.",,60,0,0,3,3,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",2056-3051,,,SOC MEDIA SOC,Soc.

We offer a broader, more positive conceptualization of time on social media by highlighting an alternative set of time-related practices and experiences, mediated by bullet comments. Following recent studies of individuals' making and experiencing of time in media-saturated societies, our article investigates Chinese social media users' diverse time-sensitive practices and multi-dimensional temporal experiences. We outline their creative practices from the bottom up, which make use of the distinct technological design of bullet comments. Four interrelated themes in their temporal experiences are analyzed and the similarities and differences with the Deleuzian concept of crystal of time explained. Overall, we demonstrate the semiotic power of digital writing in facilitating new meaning-making practices, producing multi-layered mediated temporalities, and affording multisensory, enriching, bonding experiences.

It also aims to address some of the concerns raised by Humphreys about how studies on mobile social networks have mainly been location-based, while increasingly, the use of socializing apps is non-locative. This concern is addressed primarily by offering a non-location-based approach to study mobile spatiality and sociality. This approach involves studying spatial integration afforded by smartphone chat apps with their ubiquitous connectivity, portability, and fluidity. While content analysis showed that cross-directional hybrid space exists and that the elements from the physical space migrate to the virtual space, the use of space-event text matrix further helped in unraveling the nature of cross-directionality more closely.","[Singh Apte, Deepti; Upadhyay, Ashwani Kumar] Symbiosis Int Deemed Univ, Symbiosis Inst Media & Commun SIMC, Pune, Maharashtra, India; [Singh Apte, Deepti] Univ Mumbai, KES Shroff Coll Arts & Commerce, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India",Symbiosis International University; Symbiosis Institute of Media & Communication (SIMC); University of Mumbai,"Apte, DS (corresponding author), KES Shroff Coll, Bhulabhai Desai Rd, Mumbai 400067, Maharashtra, India.",deepapte@gmail.com,"Apte, Deepti/AAM-9741-2020; Upadhyay, Ashwani/D-8579-2015","Upadhyay, Ashwani/0000-0001-7994-1150",National Communication Association (NCA),National Communication Association (NCA),"The authors are indebted to National Communication Association (NCA) for supporting the study with Dale Leathers Grant, 2020 of $ 676.",,14,0,0,1,1,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",2056-3051,,,SOC MEDIA SOC,Soc.

We argue that practices of WhatsApp usage have multiplied and diversified experiences of co-presence at distance and made group socialities even more important than before. Building on the concepts of scalable socialities and polymedia, the article formulates the concept of scalable co-presence to account for ways in which WhatsApp has enabled multiple experiences of proximity to others across different scales of sociality, from one-to-one to large groups interactions. In this article, we also argue that the concept of scalable co-presence is relevant to bring the study of mediated co-presence out of media and migration studies into the broader field of media and cultural studies. With reduction in mobility, increased social distancing, and ubiquitous connectivity, the role of communication technologies in mediating proximity at distance has become crucial for many more people around the world outside the context of transnational migration.

Data were collected continuously and analyzed with a combination of topic modeling and social network analysis. Four unique archetypes were characterized based on the level of activity and longevity of interest. Participants for each were diverse, but not different. Structural differences in each network were noted with high levels of inter-group information flow within certain archetypes.

Overall, I illuminate how Instagram and YouTube became sites of contention between brands, users, influencers, to engage in discourse about the political economy and material culture of Black beauty.","[Childs, Kiara M.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Commun, 308 Bynum Hall, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,"Childs, KM (corresponding author), Univ N Carolina, Dept Commun, 308 Bynum Hall, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",kiarac@live.unc.edu,,,,,,,43,0,0,6,6,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",2056-3051,,,SOC MEDIA SOC,Soc.

We used social network analysis to segment publics based on their information sharing behaviors in the case of the Chinese #MeToo movement in 2018 on Sina Weibo. Besides, we conducted a content analysis to reveal the characteristics of each type of publics. We have identified three meaningful social-mediated publics in the Chinese #MeToo movement on Sina Weibo: (1) the provoking public, who plays an essential role in initiating the discussion; (2) the bridging public, which contributes to spreading the discussion to various groups of people; and (3) the powerful public, who has the advantages of the first two segments of publics and is the most powerful one in the formation and development of the online discussion. Three publics have different characteristics. The provoking public (e.g., media and internet celebrities) typically has many followers and is interested in various social issues. The bridging public has fewer followers (e.g., grassroots individuals) but tends to have a special interest in the issue and actively uses social media. The powerful public has a large number of followers, a particular interest in this issue, and is active on social media. This public segmentation provides a relatively new perspective to understand publics in digital activism in societies with strict social norms and media censorship. Limitations and future research are discussed.","[Ma, Lingyan] Univ Maryland, Commun, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Zhang, Yueqian] Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Zhang, Yueqian] AutoZone Inc, Memphis, TN USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Ma, LY (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Dept Commun, College Pk, MD 20740 USA.",lyma@umd.edu,,,,,,,39,0,0,10,11,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",2056-3051,,,SOC MEDIA SOC,Soc.

To understand processes of self-making on TikTok, we undertake two methods of data collection: a walkthrough of the app and its surrounding environment, and 14 semistructured participant interviews. A qualitative analysis of this data finds three distinct themes emerge: (I) awareness of the algorithm, (2) content without context, and (3) self-creation across platforms.

In this study, we explore how three major social media platforms (Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube) responded to this infodemic during early stages of the pandemic via emergent fact-checking policies and practices, and consider what this means for ensuring a well-informed public. We accomplish this through a thematic analysis of documents published by the three platforms that address fact-checking, particularly those that focus on COVID-19. In addition to examining what the platforms said they did, we also examined what the platforms actually did in practice via a retrospective case study drawing on secondary data about the viral conspiracy video, Plandemic. We demonstrate that the platforms focused their energies primarily on the visibility of COVID-19 mis/disinformation on their sites via (often vaguely described) policies and practices rife with subjectivity. Moreover, the platforms communicated the expectation that users should ultimately be the ones to hash out what they believe is true. We argue that this approach does not necessarily serve the goal of ensuring a well-informed public, as has been the goal of fact-checking historically, and does little to address the underlying conditions and structures that permit the circulation and amplification of false information online.","[Cotter, Kelley] Penn State Univ, Coll Informat Sci & Technol, E331 Westgate Bldg, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [DeCook, Julia R.] Loyola Univ, Advocacy & Social Change, Sch Commun, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Kanthawala, Shaheen] Univ Alabama, Dept Journalism & Creat Media, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Loyola University Chicago; University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa,"Cotter, K (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Coll Informat Sci & Technol, E331 Westgate Bldg, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",kcotter@psu.edu,,"Kanthawala, Shaheen/0000-0001-9321-0266; Cotter, Kelley/0000-0003-1243-0131",,,,,67,2,2,8,16,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",2056-3051,,,SOC MEDIA SOC,Soc.

We demonstrate the usefulness of our imagined audience framework using a multi-country survey data set. Results from the United States, South Korea, and Japan reveal that expressive use of social media is associated with more extreme political attitudes and heightened intolerance, but the effect is contingent on whom the expresser has in mind as their audience. In particular, expressing one's political self has a depolarizing effect for those expecting low audience reinforcement. We test the boundary conditions of our model in a more restricted information environment with a Chinese sample.

We unpack these notions by illustrating the process of extracting protest event data from the Global Database of Events, Language and Tone (GDELT) in six European countries over a period of seven years. To stand up to rigorous scientific scrutiny, we collected additional data by computational means and undertook large-scale neural-network translation tasks, dictionary-based content analyses, machine-learning classification tasks, and human coding. In a documentation and critical discussion of this process, we render visible opaque procedures that inevitably shape any dataset and show how this type of freely available datasets require significant additional resources of knowledge, labor, money, and computational power.

The aim is to capture both the semantic and syntactic structure of dialogue, in a format that is independent of the domain or topic, and which facilitates the computational modeling of dialogue. A labeling task undertaken by novice annotators is used to evaluate its efficacy on a selection of task-oriented and non-task-oriented dialogs, and to measure inter-annotator agreement. To deepen the human-factors analysis we also record and examine users' self-reported confidence scores and average utterance annotation times. Inter-annotator agreement is shown to be higher for task-oriented dialogs than non-task-oriented, though the structure of the dialogue itself has a more significant impact. We further examine the assumptions around expected agreement for two weighted agreement coefficients, Alpha and Beta, and show that annotators assign labels using similar probability distributions, small variations can result in large differences in agreement values between biased and unbiased measures.","[Duran, Nathan; Battle, Steve; Smith, Jim] Univ West England, Dept Comp Sci & Creat Technol, Frenchay Campus,Coldharbour Ln, Bristol BS16 1QY, Avon, England",University of West England,"Duran, N (corresponding author), Univ West England, Dept Comp Sci & Creat Technol, Frenchay Campus,Coldharbour Ln, Bristol BS16 1QY, Avon, England.",nathan.duran@uwe.ac.Uk,"; Smith, Jim/M-7533-2015","Duran, Nathan/0000-0001-6084-4406; Smith, Jim/0000-0001-7908-1859",,,,,71,0,0,4,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1931-2458,1931-2466,,COMMUN METHODS MEAS,Commun.

Despite being individual expressions, they vastly transcend the individual level as windows into and vehicles for wide-stretching social, cultural, and political narratives. Empirical research into meme culture is thriving, yet particularly compartmentalized. In the humanities and social sciences, most efforts involve in-depth linguistic and visual analyses of mostly handpicked examples of memes, begging the question on the origins and meanings of those particular expressions. In technical disciplines, such as computer science, efforts are focused on the large-scale identification and classification of meme images, as well as patterns of viral spread at scale. This contribution aims to bridge the chasm between depth and scale by introducing a three-step approach suitable for computational grounded theoretical studies in which (1) an automated procedure establishes formal links between meme images drawn from a large-scale corpus paving the way for (2) network analysis to infer patterns of relatedness and spread, and (3) practically classifying visually related images in file folders for the purpose of further local, hermeneutic analysis.

Our simulation revealed a strong impact of analytical choices, which invited disparate interpretations in terms of how polarized news audiences are, how strongly audience polarization structurally varies between news environments, and how news audience polarization is distributed cross-nationally. Alternative choices led to profound differences in the compatibility, consistency, and validity of the empirical news audience polarization estimates.

We empirically assess the consequences of these approaches based on both a quantitative comparison of models and a qualitative validation of each method's potentials and weaknesses. Our case study uses two text collections (of tweets and news articles) in three languages (English, Hebrew, Arabic), covering the ongoing local conflicts between Israeli authorities, settlers, and Palestinian Bedouins in the West Bank. We find that both methods produce a large share of equivalent topics, especially in the context of fairly homogenous news discourse, yet show limited but systematic differences when applied to highly heterogenous social media discourse. While the MD model delivers a more nuanced picture of conflict-related topics, it misses several more peripheral topics, especially those unrelated to the dictionary's focus, which are picked up by the MT model.

First, we contend that CTAM development has prioritized technological over validity concerns, giving limited attention to the operationalization of social scientific measurements. Second, we identify a mismatch between CTAMs' focus on extracting specific contents and document-level patterns, and social science researchers' need for measuring multiple, often complex contents in the text. Third, we argue that the dominance of English language tools depresses comparative research and inclusivity toward scholarly communities examining languages other than English. We substantiate our claims by drawing upon a broad review of methodological work in the computational social sciences, as well as an inventory of leading research publications using quantitative textual analysis. Subsequently, we discuss implications of these three gaps for social scientists' uneven uptake of CTAM, as well as the field of computational social science text research as a whole.

Researchers often rely on simple keyword searches to do this, even though this may introduce considerable selection bias. Such bias may be even greater when researchers lack the domain knowledge required to make informed search decisions, for example, in cross-national research or research on unfamiliar social contexts. We propose expert-informed topic modeling (EITM) as a hybrid approach to tackle this problem. EITM combines the validity of external domain knowledge captured through expert surveys with probabilistic topic models to help researchers identify subsets of documents that cover initially unknown domain-specific topics, such as specific events and debates, that belong to a researcher-defined master topic. EITM is a flexible and efficient approach to the thematic selection of documents from large text corpora for further study. We benchmark and validate the method by discovering blog posts that address the public role of religion within large corpora of Australian, Swiss, and Turkish blog posts and provide researchers with a complete workflow to guide the application of EITM in their own work.","[Rinke, Eike Mark] Univ Leeds, Sch Polit & Int Studies, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Rinke, Eike Mark; Dobbrick, Timo] Univ Mannheim, Mannheim Ctr European Social Res MZES, Mannheim, Germany; [Loeb, Charlotte; Wessler, Hartmut] Univ Mannheim, Inst Media & Commun Studies, Mannheim, Germany; [Zirn, Cacilia] Univ Mannheim, Data & Web Sci Grp, Mannheim, Germany",University of Leeds; University of Mannheim; University of Mannheim; University of Mannheim,"Rinke, EM (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Sch Polit & Int Studies, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",e.m.rinke@leeds.ac.uk,"Rinke, Eike/GWZ-8265-2022","Rinke, Eike Mark/0000-0002-5330-7634; Lob, Charlotte/0000-0002-5874-6986; Wessler, Hartmut/0000-0003-4216-5471; Dobbrick, Timo/0000-0002-6252-1157",German Research Foundation (DFG) [WE 2888/6-1],German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),This research was funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG) Grant WE 2888/6-1.,,36,4,4,1,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1931-2458,1931-2466,,COMMUN METHODS MEAS,Commun.

Simulated conversations between 108 trainees and 12 standardized patients were assessed by 7 coders using the two versions of CQA (transcript and realtime). Participants also completed two traditional communication quality assessment measures. Real-time CQA was feasible and yielded fair to excellent reliability, with some caveats that can be addressed in future work. CQA ratings were moderately correlated with traditional measures of communication quality, suggesting that CQA captures different aspects of communication quality than do traditional measures. Finally, CQA did not exhibit the ceiling effects observed in the traditional measures of communication quality.

In this paper, we first detail the experiences and insights of a data collection of 110 Instagram DDPs gathered from 102 adolescents. We successively discuss the challenges and opportunities of collecting and analyzing DDPs to help future researchers in their consideration of whether and how to use DDPs. DDPs provide tremendous opportunities to get insight in the frequency, range, and content of social media activities, from browsing to searching and posting. Yet, collecting, processing, and analyzing DDPs is also complex and laborious, and demands numerous procedural and analytical choices and decisions.","[van Driel, Irene I.; Beyens, Ine; Valkenburg, Patti M.] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Commun Res, Nieuwe Achtergracht 166, NL-1018 WN Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Giachanou, Anastasia; Boeschoten, Laura] Univ Utrecht, Dept Methodol & Stat, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Pouwels, J.

In this study, we propose two statistical bias correction methods-Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW) and Type II Tobit, which are designed to remedy selection bias of inference from digital trace data donated by research participants. Applying these methods to Facebook take-out data, we demonstrate how the correction methods can change estimated effect sizes, which is important for the translation of academic findings into real-world impacts. We conduct two simulation studies, one under fully synthetic and another under partially simulated conditions, and find that Type II Tobit generally provides a more robust and cost-efficient correction method for digital trace data.","[Pak, Chankyung] Kyungpook Natl Univ, Dept Journalism & Mass Commun, 80 Daehak Ro, Daegu 41566, South Korea; [Cotter, Kelley] Penn State Univ, Coll Informat Sci & Technol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Thorson, Kjerstin] Michigan State Univ, Dept Advertising Publ Relat, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Thorson, Kjerstin] Michigan State Univ, Sch Journalism, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Kyungpook National University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Michigan State University; Michigan State University,"Pak, C (corresponding author), Kyungpook Natl Univ, Dept Journalism & Mass Commun, 80 Daehak Ro, Daegu 41566, South Korea.",chankyungpak@uic.edu.hk,,"Cotter, Kelley/0000-0003-1243-0131; Pak, Chankyung/0000-0003-4348-6939",,,,,37,0,0,3,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1931-2458,1931-2466,,COMMUN METHODS MEAS,Commun.

To validate the scale, we use item response theory and report findings from two studies. In study 1, we tested 46 items among N = 331 participants, resulting in a 32-item pool. These items were tested in a second study among N = 1,041 German internet users. The final scale consists of each 11 items measuring algorithm awareness and knowledge.

The appeal of this model is that it derives lists of related clustered words in different languages with little reliance on translation or multilingual dictionaries and without the need for manual post-hoc matching of topics. PLTM bridges the gap between languages by making use of document connections in training documents. As these training documents are the crucial resource for the model, we compare model evaluation metrics for different strategies to build training documents.

Findings indicated that most of the IDEA communication on Facebook focused on gender and racial/ethnicity diversity, employee, and community stakeholders. The IDEA communication was almost equally value-and performance-driven and reflected external promotion level of investment. External stakeholders engaged more with performance-driven and external promotion IDEA communication. The volume of IDEA posts reflected corporate internal diversity practice and was positively related with Glassdoor ratings of the corporation by African American, Middle Eastern, and LGBTQ+ employees.","[Zhang, Xiaochen Angela] Univ Oklahoma, Gaylord Coll Journalism & Mass Commun, 395 W Linsey Room 3019, Norman, OK 73019 USA",University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman,"Zhang, XA (corresponding author), Univ Oklahoma, Gaylord Coll Journalism & Mass Commun, 395 W Linsey Room 3019, Norman, OK 73019 USA.",angelazhang@ou.edu,,,,,,,57,0,0,2,2,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0363-8111,1873-4537,,PUBLIC RELAT REV,Public Relat.

Lessons from a government program,PUBLIC RELATIONS REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,Listening; Citizen engagement; Community engagement; Social capital; Public sector,PUBLIC-RELATIONS; COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT; COMMUNICATION; PARTICIPATION; GAP,"In public relations research, the concept of engagement is often theorized but seldom observed in practice. This research focuses on what public leaders learn when they undertake actions centered on learning by listening to society to implement governmental citizen engagement programs. Taking an inductive grounded approach to data analysis which draws on tools and methods of grounded theory as well as including a review of key concepts from public relations literature, a reflexive analysis of an action learning intervention involving the members of a provincial government was conducted. Results show that, when reflecting on interaction with stakeholders of the program, government members: increase their knowledge about both sides of the public organization-society relationship; become more sensitive to what listening is and implies, and, hence, more supportive of two-way communication; are challenged about the authenticity of the motivations behind their listening; become more aware of ways in which they work to build social capital; and, subsequently, increase their willingness to act together with society. This paper shows that reflection on the real implementation of engagement programs gives policy makers a better understanding of normative assumptions, and hence it instantiates public relations theories and concepts about engagement. By identifying acting-by-listening as integral to citizen engagement, it presents implications for the study and practice of public relations in public sector organizations.","[Canel, Maria Jose] Univ Complutense Madrid, Madrid, Spain; [Barandiaran, Xabier] Univ Deusto, Bilbao, Spain; [Murphy, Anne] Univ Lancaster, Lancaster, England",Complutense University of Madrid; University of Deusto; Lancaster University,"Canel, MJ (corresponding author), Univ Complutense Madrid, Madrid, Spain.",mjcanel@ucm.es; xabier.barandiaran@deusto.es; a.murphy2@lancaster.ac.uk,,"Canel, Maria Jose/0000-0002-5048-124X; Murphy, Anne/0000-0002-0980-8183",,,,,50,1,1,2,3,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0363-8111,1873-4537,,PUBLIC RELAT REV,Public Relat.

Two narrative counter strategies to address misinformation about the safety of the MMR vaccine (i.e., personal stories of uneventful vaccinations where a parent talks about how their child was vaccinated and no injury happened to them, and narratives of anti-vax to pro-vax conversions, where a former anti-vaccine parent narrates their experience of their child getting sick with a vaccine-preventable disease and thus realizing the importance of vaccines) were compared to a non-narrative counter message (an infographic, in the case of the present study) in increasing belief in the counter, reducing vaccine misinformation, and increasing MMR vaccination intentions. Second, we tested a theoretically grounded model predicting MMR vaccination intentions and misinformation amplification likelihood, combining pre-existing issue-specific situational motivation in problem solving with perceived counter and misinformation source credibility and message effects.

Findings from the current study indicate that these perceptions are sensitive to cultural factors in a CSR context. Further, while scholars widely accept the need for transparent communication about CSR (Chaudhri & Wang, 2007), trade research indicates that organizational transparency falls short of consumer expectations (Edelman, 2016).

The authors argue that advocacy and accommodation can vary independently in response to a variety of contingent factors. To comprehensively capture the locations and motions that are possible in organization-public conflicts, a two-continuum approach is proposed. Separate assessment of the effects of contingency variables on advocacy and accommodation can be used to accurately locate organizational stance along advocacy and accommodation continua. Strategic alternatives that cannot be depicted using a single continuum (such as favorable alignment of organization advocacy/ public accommodation or unilateral change on the part of one party) can be captured if separate continua are employed. By depicting initial stances and desired directions of movement for both the organization and public, the dual-continuum approach can also provide practical guidance to public relations professionals in selecting strategies for achieving preferred outcomes and evaluating their effectiveness.","[Christen, Cindy T.; Lovaas, Steven R.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Journalism & Media Commun, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA",Colorado State University,"Christen, CT (corresponding author), 199 Davis Cup Dr,Unit 4063, Pagosa Springs, CO 81147 USA.",cindy.christen@colostate.edu,,,,,,,46,0,0,1,1,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0363-8111,1873-4537,,PUBLIC RELAT REV,Public Relat.

Some CSA campaigns have failed in the past (e.g., Pepsi's 2017 Live for Now Moments Anthem video) by generating public backlash and damaging corporate reputation. To test how to design CSA campaigns that are beneficial for both the corporation and the advocacy issue, the current between-subjects experiment (N = 508) employed a 2 (issue salience: moderate vs. high) X 2 (valence: negative vs. positive) X 2 (arousal: moderate vs. high) factorial design to test the effects of salience, valence, and arousal on memory and four persuasion outcomes: company attitudes, purchase intentions, political participation intentions, and social media intentions, while also analyzing the mediation of information processing. Findings support prior research suggesting that negative valence increases persuasion in CSA contexts. A high-salience issue and high-arousal language increased political participation and social media intentions but had no effect on company attitudes or purchase intentions. Practical implications for CSA campaign designers highlight the persuasive potential of negative valence in CSA messages, and the utility of high-salience and high-arousal for political action and social media engagement.","[DiRusso, Carlina] Ketchum Inc, 225 N Michigan Ave, Chicago, IL 60601 USA; [Buckley, Christen; Dardis, Frank E.; Eng, Nicholas] Penn State Univ, Donald P Bellisario Coll Commun, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Diddi, Pratiti] Lamar Univ, Dept Commun & Media, Beaumont, TX 77710 USA; [Vafeiadis, Michail] Auburn Univ, Sch Commun & Journalism, Auburn, AL 36849 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Texas State University System; Lamar University; Auburn University System; Auburn University,"DiRusso, C (corresponding author), Ketchum Inc, 225 N Michigan Ave, Chicago, IL 60601 USA.",dirusso.carlina@gmail.com; clb5344@psu.edu; pdiddi@lamar.edu; fed3@psu.edu; mzv0042@auburn.edu; nje49@psu.edu,,,,,,,65,0,0,7,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0363-8111,1873-4537,,PUBLIC RELAT REV,Public Relat.

In this study, we question this argument and provide empirical evidence by conducting a survey that links media channels' affordances to their capability to carry organizations' dialogic orientations. Results show that bandwidth and social presence affordances facilitate dialogic communication while anonymity slightly inhibits it, whether the communicative context is proactive or reactive. Social presence exerts the greatest impact on how publics perceive organizations' dialogic orientations, and anonymity's negative role was overstated by previous studies. Assessing media channels' dialogic affordances, we found video conferencing and instant messaging to be the most dialogic channels for mediated organization-public communication.","[Zhou, Alvin] Univ Minnesota, Hubbard Sch Journalism & Mass Commun, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Xu, Sifan] Univ Tennessee, Tombras Sch Advertising & Publ Relat, Knoxville, TN USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville,"Zhou, A (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Hubbard Sch Journalism & Mass Commun, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",alvinyxz@umn.edu; sifanxu@utk.edu,"Zhou, Alvin/L-3760-2019","Zhou, Alvin/0000-0001-5410-9712",,,,,90,0,0,6,6,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0363-8111,1873-4537,,PUBLIC RELAT REV,Public Relat.

This study provides a critical and comprehensive review of empirical studies on the role of emotional intelligence in various domains of public relations practice. Findings reveal that existing research has focused mostly on emotional intelligence as a competency vital to effective leadership and employee communication in organizations. Considerable research has also examined emotional intelligence as a necessity for effective crisis management and communication.

This corporate social responsibility (CSR) must be communicated effectively as too intensive communication could negatively affect the company's perception.

Two experiments show that increased CSR communication has a negative indirect effect on perceptions of a company's social responsibility, mediated by persuasive intent and reactance. However, depending on the extent of a company's actual CSR activities, there is also a countervailing direct effect: A high extent of CSR communication positively affects perceptions of a company's social responsibility if the company engages in a great number of CSR activities. In contrast, if a company only engages in a few activities but communicates a lot about it, this positive effect may even become negative.","[Viererbl, Benno; Koch, Thomas] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Dept Commun, Mainz, Germany",Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz,"Viererbl, B (corresponding author), Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Dept Commun, Mainz, Germany.",benno.viererbl@uni-mainz.de; thomas.koch@uni-mainz.de,,"Koch, Thomas/0000-0002-3495-5855",,,,,71,4,4,5,24,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0363-8111,1873-4537,,PUBLIC RELAT REV,Public Relat.

Considering the critical role of Twitter in the information transmissions during the ongoing pandemic, this study considered politicians' tweets as a proxy to access their crisis communication strategies and conducted a systematic content analysis to critically evaluate COVID-19 crisis communication strategies of two politicians, Trump and Cuomo, according to their perceived day-to-day circumstances during COVID-19. Three strategies categorized by SCCT, deny, diminish, and bolstering, surfaced with significance for both Trump and Cuomo. A new strategy specific to the political context, cohesion, was also identified. In addition, significant differentiation was observed in the strategic narratives between Trump and Cuomo, which reveals the evolving political dynamics in disease representation and crisis messaging. For example, Trump emphasized social exclusion and accusations of Democrats whilst Cuomo stressed care for vulnerable and minority groups and compassion delivery. Moreover, deny strategy, especially accusing other races, significantly boosted audience engagement for Trump. The results are discussed in relation to the idiosyncrasy of the complex COVID-19 pandemic and crisis communication in the political realm.

In particular, we examined the attribution of crisis responsibility related to the spread of COVID-19 and its relations to the negative emotions of U.S. citizens on Twitter for six months (from January 20 to June 30, 2020). The results of this study showed that social media analytics is a valid tool to monitor how the spread of COVID-19 evolved from an issue to a crisis for the Trump administration. In addition, the federal government's lack of response and inability to handle the outbreak led to citizens' engagement and amplification of negative tweets that blamed the Trump White House.

The results show that the Dieselgate was reframed in 2018 as an industry-wide scandal where the conflict, morality, and attribution of responsibility frame were most dominant. We argue that the first wrongdoer in an industry creates a crisis history, which potentially becomes an intensifying factor for competitors who are confronted with similar crises in a later stage.

Based on contingency and social identity theories, we test the dual orientation conflict model (DOCM) in the field of government public relations.

In addition, a display of empathy can mitigate reputational damage as well. But how can an organization in crisis put expressions of empathy into words? This study examines three distinct manners to verbally express empathy (i.e., claiming vs. demonstrating understanding; cognitive vs. affective empathy; intensified vs. unintensified verbal expression of empathy) and explores their impact on the post-crisis reputation through three experimental studies. The first two studies also examine the crisis type as a potential boundary condition. The results confirm that an expression of empathy can help protect an organization's reputation, during both a victim crisis and a preventable crisis. When an organization expresses empathy for those who suffer from a crisis, the public may in turn experience empathic concern towards the organization, which helps to alleviate reputational damage. The positive effect of empathy expressions differs, however, depending on the way in which it is verbally articulated.","[Fannes, Gijs] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Inst Media Studies, Parkstr 45, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium; [Claeys, An-Sofie] Dept Translat Interpreting & Commun, UGent Groot Brittannielaan 45, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",KU Leuven; Ghent University,"Fannes, G (corresponding author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, Inst Media Studies, Parkstr 45, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.",gijs.fannes@kuleuven.be; ansofie.claeys@ugent.be,,,,,,,62,0,0,9,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0363-8111,1873-4537,,PUBLIC RELAT REV,Public Relat.

The study proposes a new development project communication model which seeks to initiate, secure and sustain positive community outcomes and meet the project initiators' requirements. This is achieved through collaboration and the gradual relinquishment of power and decision-making from the latter to the former. The model emphasizes the importance of the processes of communication as well as outcomes, and considers rural communities as having agency, rather than as objects of or for development. By embracing community assets such as local knowledge and contextual wisdom and the characteristics of collective communities in non-Western countries such as togetherness, reciprocity, a strong sense of shared destiny, locality, and fraternity, the model offers a community centric approach which encourages progressive community empowerment and ownership.

Moreover, the relationship between communicating diverse alliance ties and positive public reactions in the form of likes went both ways.

Structural equation modeling results of 660 online survey responses suggest that OPDC has a positive association with communal relationships and negative association with exchange relationships. Facilitation behavior positively contributes to exchange relationships. Both communal and exchange relationships are positively associated with employees' positive megaphoning. Yet, negative megaphoning is negatively linked with communal relationships and positively linked with exchange relationships. This study contributes to the growing body of literature on internal CSR communication and management. More importantly, it uncovers the nuanced effects of CSR on employee-organization communal and exchange relationship building.","[Song, Baobao] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Robertson Sch Media & Culture, 901 West Main St, Richmond, VA 23284 USA; [Tao, Weiting] Univ Miami, Sch Commun, Dept Strateg Commun, 5100 Brunson Dr, Coral Gables, FL 33146 USA",Virginia Commonwealth University; University of Miami,"Song, BB (corresponding author), Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Robertson Sch Media & Culture, 901 West Main St, Richmond, VA 23284 USA.",weiting.tao@miami.edu,,"Tao, Weiting/0000-0002-5822-2648",,,,,79,2,2,7,11,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0363-8111,1873-4537,,PUBLIC RELAT REV,Public Relat.

Despite the overflow of these videos, their impact is still questionable to understand the magnitude of this online apology. Thus, applying image repair theory (IRT), this two-part exploratory study examined the message construction, strategies, sincerity and forgiveness of YouTubers' apology videos. Study 1 was a content analysis of YouTube apology videos (N = 117), and the findings indicated that YouTubers carefully curated their natural appearance and overemphasized the phrase I'm sorry  to direct their viewers, emphasizing on the mortification strategy. Study 2 utilized Logan Paul's infamous apology video to conduct an online survey (N = 194), which identified the relationship between perceived sincerity and forgiveness. Our findings suggest that prior connections with the YouTuber increased viewers' chance of forgiveness, and perceived sincerity was the predictor of forgiveness. Implications of the findings are discussed in terms of future guidelines for crisis communication.","[Choi, Grace Y.; Mitchell, Anne Marie] Columbia Coll, Chicago, IL 65201 USA",,"Choi, GY (corresponding author), Columbia Coll, Chicago, IL 65201 USA.",grchoi.choi@gmail.com; anmitchell@colum.edu,,,,,,,71,0,0,9,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0363-8111,1873-4537,,PUBLIC RELAT REV,Public Relat.

This study seeks to understand how CSR influences the nonprofit partners involved in these initiatives and what types of CSR partnerships lead to nonprofit supportive intentions. This study merges per-spectives on organization-public relationships (OPR) with nonprofit management literature. An online 2 (NPO reputation: low vs high) x 2 (partnership duration: short vs. long) x 2 (CSR fit: low vs. high) experiment was conducted. A few key factors emerged in the analysis: Positive nonprofit reputation strongly predicted all OPR outcomes and mission accomplishment. Unexpectedly, the short-duration condition led to more positive out-comes and intentions. Fit did not seem to have a direct effect on outcomes, but the high-fit, short-duration partnership led to increased levels of all outcomes. For mediation, satisfaction and commitment had the strongest indirect effects on nonprofit supportive intentions (donation, volunteer, and word-of-mouth). This study expands the understanding of CSR effects on nonprofit partners, specifically by showing how different CSR partnership types play a role in the relationship-building efforts of nonprofits. Additionally, demonstrating how mission accomplishment can strengthen these relationships helps to disentangle the unique position of nonprofits in CSR, whose reputation and mission are at stake.","[Harrison, Virginia S.] Clemson Univ, Dept Commun, 409 Strode Tower, Clemson, SC 29634 USA; [Vafeiadis, Michail] Auburn Univ, Sch Commun & Journalism, Auburn, AL USA; [Diddi, Pratiti] George Mason Univ, Dept Commun, Fairfax, VA USA; [Buckley, Christen; Dardis, Frank E.] Penn State Univ, Bellisario Coll Commun, State Coll, PA USA",Clemson University; Auburn University System; Auburn University; George Mason University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University,"Harrison, VS (corresponding author), Clemson Univ, Dept Commun, 409 Strode Tower, Clemson, SC 29634 USA.",virginia.s.harrison@gmail.com; mzv0042@auburn.edu; pdiddi@gmu.edu; clb5344@psu.edu; fed3@psu.edu,,,"Arthur W.

Using qualitative content analysis, this study examines 1000 public comments from the top 10 hashtag posts and explores the interaction between nationalist expression (i.e., content and sentiment of nationalism) and the public's perception of the United Airlines crisis in 2017. The findings demonstrate how nationalist content impinged upon the interpretation of United Airlines' misconduct. Six concrete emotions (anger, hared, amusement, pride, encouragement, and disgust) were identified from the sample comments, which were categorized into inward-directed and outward-directed nationalist sentiments. Given the findings, this study argues that nationalist expression has driven the evolution of the United Airlines crisis beyond the discussion of organizational misconduct. While inward-directed sentiment served to strengthen the Chinese public's national identity, outward-directed sentiment was utilized to exclude multinational cor-porations as out-groups.

Companies are also using CSV as business opportunities to develop their competitiveness. Only a few studies, however, have examined how organizations can develop and implement CSV programs, and the outcomes of those programs. We conducted a case study on how a multinational company, Yuhan-Kimberly, a joint venture of Kimberly-Clark and Yuhan, developed and implemented its CSV program, and created win-win, mutually beneficial impacts, in response to an increasingly aging society in Korea. South Korea is the world's most rapidly aging society with the highest poverty and suicide rates among older adults. Yuhan-Kimberly's CSV initiative includes fostering small-sized senior care businesses, creating jobs for older adults, changing the negative perception of older adults, and ultimately creating a market ecosystem for the older adult care industry. We used triangulation through company documents, including annual sustainability reports (N = 10), news reports (N = 623), company-conducted survey results (N = 80), and in-depth interviews (N = 14) with em-ployees and members of other organizations and publics. The results reveal how the company developed and implemented a CSV program to cultivate mutually beneficial relationships and shared value for the company, older adults, other organizations, and society. The results indicate that CSV programs can be powerful rela-tionship cultivation strategies to create mutual benefits both for society, by providing sustainable and feasible solutions, and for organizations, by enhancing their competitive advantages.","[Lim, JungKyu Rhys; Lee, Sun Young] Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Lim, JR (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",jk.rhys.lim@gmail.com; sunlee@umd.edu,"Lim, Jungkyu Rhys/AAI-3972-2020","Lim, Jungkyu Rhys/0000-0002-5006-2491",,,,,115,0,0,7,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0363-8111,1873-4537,,PUBLIC RELAT REV,Public Relat.

Specifically, this study examined whether a customer-credit-sharing CSR message, compared to a conventional self-promoting message, better mitigated the effects of skeptical comments from other SNSs users on values-driven motives perceived by customers, customers' positive attitudes, and behavioral intentions. It also explored whether the effects of strategic framing changed when skeptical comments were made online by friends or strangers. A total of 400 customers participated in an online between-subjects experiment. The results showed that the credit-sharing message better protected perceived values-driven motives and positive attitudes toward the company after the customers were exposed to skeptical comments, regardless of who posted the skeptical comments. Customers who read the credit-sharing message also showed stronger intention to defend the company's CSR efforts and stronger purchase intention when the skeptical comments came from a friend.

Our findings demonstrate the common trends and differences between regions or societies. Scholars from North America dominated this field and primarily used quantitative methods, such as content analysis and experiments. A Western-oriented situational crisis communication theory was the most frequently applied theoretical framework. Twitter and Facebook were the most frequently used social media tools, and natural crises were studied most frequently. Nearly half of the SMCC studies collected research data about crises within America, and none focused on African countries. Contextual factors, such as political, cultural, and media characteristics, were found to affect online crisis communication practices. Our study can thus inform future discussions by revealing current theoretical gaps.","[Cheng, Yang] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Commun, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Wang, Yuan] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Media & Commun, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Kong, Yeqing] Univ North Carolina Wilmington, Dept English, Wilmington, NC USA",University of North Carolina; North Carolina State University; City University of Hong Kong; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Wilmington,"Cheng, Y (corresponding author), North Carolina State Univ, Dept Commun, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",ycheng20@ncsu.edu; yuan.wang@cityu.edu.hk; kongy@uncw.edu,,"Kong, Yeqing/0000-0001-7815-0701; Wang, Yuan/0000-0003-3623-4354",,,,,101,1,1,11,11,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0363-8111,1873-4537,,PUBLIC RELAT REV,Public Relat.

Three main conclusions arise from these themes: PR agency self-identity is in a process of change from media-relations to strategic consultants; the main source of the change is perceived as media disruption rather than digital disruption (although they are interrelated); and the future in PR is predicted as the all-in-one marketing communications agency, which might develop into a new, hybrid, profession.","[Zimand-Sheiner, Dorit; Lahav, Tamar] Ariel Univ, Sch Commun, Ariel, Israel",Ariel University,"Zimand-Sheiner, D (corresponding author), Ariel Univ, Sch Commun, Ariel, Israel.",doritzs@ariel.ac.il; tamarlahav37@gmail.com,,,,,,,64,0,0,2,2,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0363-8111,1873-4537,,PUBLIC RELAT REV,Public Relat.

The study combines social network analysis with in-depth interviews to adopt a more holistic framework for studying online opinion leadership in the context of public relations research. Ultimately, results from this study extend the network paradigm in public relations by examining the role of individual users in the construction of the discursive landscape around issue networks.

Yet, keeping a good track record might also backfire to cause more reputational damages, which is often observed when organizations deal with value-oriented moral crises. Against this backdrop, drawing from the literature on crisis communication and moral psychology, we situated our study in the scansis context, a particular type of morality-focused negative situation featuring characteristics of both crisis and scandal, and explored effects of prior reputation on people's responses to an organizational scansis. Through an online experiment (N = 293), we found severe backlash towards the scansis-stricken organization in both the control condition (i.e., no indication of reputation) and the good reputation condition, whereas such prominent difference was not observed in the bad reputation condition. The findings thus implicated the need to take the unique role of morality in scansis into account in both pertinent research and practice.","[Wei, Lewen] Tampere Univ, Fac Informat Technol & Commun Sci, Gamificat Grp, Kanslerinrinne 1, Tampere 33100, Finland; [Diddi, Pratiti] Lamar Univ, Dept Commun & Media, Beaumont, TX USA",Tampere University; Texas State University System; Lamar University,"Wei, LW (corresponding author), Tampere Univ, Fac Informat Technol & Commun Sci, Gamificat Grp, Kanslerinrinne 1, Tampere 33100, Finland.",lewen.wei@tuni.fi; pdiddi@lamar.edu,,"Wei, Lewen/0000-0002-4387-2779",,,,,93,0,0,6,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0363-8111,1873-4537,,PUBLIC RELAT REV,Public Relat.

By analyzing two crises that affected the Maxim's and Yoshinoya groups during the Hong Kong social unrest in 2019, the paper commits to explicate how internal, socio-environmental, and external publics' factors shape the communication patterns of the crisis. By focusing on Facebook posts and information available online, this study examines how the two selected organizations responded to specific crisis situations, and how publics reacted during the regenerative crisis lifecycle. Results show that Maxim's took the advocative, while Yoshinoya engaged in the accommodative stance initially. Then, they both turned to an avoidance stance to deal with active online publics with opposing political stances. Contingent factors driving the organizations to adopt specific stances were relevant to internal members, organizational characteristics, social media environment, and external publics. Results provide insights about the complexities organizations face to respond to online publics in regenerative social-mediated crises. They also advance the contingency theory by refining the advocacyaccommodation stance continuum, re-defining contingent factors, and explicating the interactive effects of contingent factors on organizational response decision making in a polarized and social-mediated context.","[Ao, Song Harris] Univ Macau, Fac Social Sci, Dept Commun, Zhuhai, Peoples R China; [Mak, Angela K.

As the Internet industry increasingly commends tremendous financial resources, they also face growing stakeholder expectations for corporate social responsibility (CSR) actions. One way through which Chinese Internet companies conduct CSR is by building cross-sectoral collaborations with nonprofit and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and governmental agencies. Aiming to understand Internet companies' strategic relationship building on CSR issues, the researchers drew from stakeholder influence theory and research on a network approach to stakeholder influence, and applied multilevel network analysis to model three networks related to Chinese Internet companies' CSR collaborations. Specifically, we found that power and urgency are significant predictors of the structure of Internet companies' cross-sector CSR alliance network. Organizations affiliated or endorsed by the central Chinese government are the most desirable CSR stakeholders. Additionally, the study also revealed that for Internet companies, devoting their attention to Internet-related social issues could increase their desirability as strategic stakeholders from other sectors and among Internet companies.","[Li, Yiqi] Syracuse Univ, Sch Informat Studies, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA; [Yang, Aimei] Univ Southern Calif, Annenberg Sch Commun & Journalism, Los Angeles, CA USA",Syracuse University; University of Southern California,"Li, YQ (corresponding author), Syracuse Univ, Sch Informat Studies, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA.",YiqiLiyli360@syr.edu; aimei.yang@usc.edu,,,,,,,82,0,0,11,11,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0363-8111,1873-4537,,PUBLIC RELAT REV,Public Relat.

The study sought to determine whether institutional relations affect the perception of organizational legitimacy, focusing on the United Arab Emirates. In non-democratic countries, public relations tends to be perceived as less sophisticated, and legitimacy becomes even more critical for foreign corporations. Therefore, a one-factorial (corporate diplomacy with/without governmental involvement) between-subjects experimental design study surveying a representative sample of residents in the United Arab Emirates (N = 199) was conducted. The results imply that corporate diplomacy with governmental linkages leads to a higher perception of moral, pragmatic, and regulative organizational legitimacy, partially mediated by media credibility, governmental legitimacy, and issue legitimacy.","[Marschlich, Sarah] Univ Zurich, Dept Commun & Media Res IKMZ, Zurich, Switzerland; [Ingenhoff, Diana] Univ Fribourg, Dept Commun & Media Res, Fribourg, Switzerland",University of Zurich; University of Fribourg,"Marschlich, S (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, IKMZ, Andreasstr 15, CH-8050 Zurich, Switzerland.",s.marschlich@ikmz.uzh.ch,"Marschlich, Sarah/AAA-7805-2022","Marschlich, Sarah/0000-0003-4251-9700; Ingenhoff, Diana/0000-0003-3034-3605",Swiss National Science Foundation [P1FRP1_184401],Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission),The study was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation under Grant P1FRP1_184401.,,140,1,1,7,20,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0363-8111,1873-4537,,PUBLIC RELAT REV,Public Relat.

In order to capture public relations engagement and potential impact on such issues, the paper presents a new measurement framework to encourage metrics for issues, communities, and societies-not just organizational priorities. This approach ensures a wider scope of levels of analysis (from message-level metrics to societal and global levels) as well as recognition of the potential value of dissensus, agonism, and agonistic metrics (Davidson & Motion, 2018) for more nuanced understandings of the work of public relations practitioners in contentious contexts.","[Capizzo, Luke] Univ Missouri, Sch Journalism, 120 Neff Hall, Columbia, MO 65211 USA",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia,"Capizzo, L (corresponding author), Univ Missouri, Sch Journalism, 120 Neff Hall, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",capizzol@gmail.com,,"Capizzo, Luke/0000-0002-5813-8219",,,,,89,0,0,0,0,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0363-8111,1873-4537,,PUBLIC RELAT REV,Public Relat.

In that communitarian spirit, this paper draws on established research streams and strategic process-to-ends paradigms to argue that unique knowledge serves to collaboratively assist the constitution of community as place in search for order. Public relations' unique knowledge, constantly refined and critically guided, adds strategic, emergent force to human's communitarian imperative. This communitarian rationale for the constitutive paradigm reasons that as individuals, organizations and communities engage to communicate they communicate to organize through narrative continuity. Organizations, individuals, and groups engage on the winding path of agonistic, emergently epistemological and ontological cultural and societal moments to seek order in the public interest.

This study examines how different levels of LGBTQ+ diversity CSR (i.e., proactive, passive, refusal) affect public responses. The proposed model investigates how public perceptions of corporate support for LGBTQ+ diversity (PCSL), influenced by CSR level, affects two dimensions of corporate associations differently (corporate ability and CSR association), and consequently CSR responses (supportive communication intent, purchase intent, and corporate evaluation in this study). The role of perceived value-driven motivation as a mediator was also examined. An online experiment was conducted with two Fortune 500 companies (Dell and Kellogg's). Overall, the results suggest that proactive CSR leads to higher PCS-L and better CSR outcomes among the general public than a passive or refusal approach. PCS-L, directly and indirectly, affects individuals' CSR associations, which are mediated by value-driven motives. In turn, CSR associations positively influence publics' supportive communication intent, purchase intent and corporate evaluations. As for CA associations, we found that they had a rather complicated relationship with PCS-L. Specifically, PCS-L had a direct negative effect on CA associations (Dell) or no effect (Kellogg), indicating possible backlash effects. However, higher PSC-L resulted in more favorable perceived motives of the CSR program, driven by the company's moral grounds and corporate values, consequently resulting in greater CA associations (positive indirect impact). Thus, perceived value-driven motives can offset potential backlash effects related to CA associations and corresponding CSR outcomes.","[Kim, Yeonsoo] Univ Texas, Sch Advertising & Publ Relat, 300W Dean Keeton A0900, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Bhalla, Nandini] Texas State Univ, Sch Journalism & Mass Commun, San Marcos, TX USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; Texas State University System; Texas State University San Marcos,"Kim, Y (corresponding author), Univ Texas, Sch Advertising & Publ Relat, 300W Dean Keeton A0900, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",yskim.payne@gmail.com; Tkk21@txstate.edu,,,,,,,67,0,0,2,2,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0363-8111,1873-4537,,PUBLIC RELAT REV,Public Relat.

To be effective, a sufficient number of individuals need to install the app and disclose information like COVID-19 infection to such an app. Yet, usage data demonstrate that a large number of app users does not disclose COVID-19 infection to the app. Hence, in two studies (overall N = 1522), we investigate factors related to individuals' willingness to actively disclose information to such an app. In a preregistered online experiment conducted two months before the app launch onto the German market, we find that disclosure willingness increases when the app's prosocial benefit or a social-life-enabling benefit is emphasized (vs. no benefit emphasized). In a subsequent, quota-representative survey study conducted two months after the app launch onto the German market, we adapted and extended the Technology Acceptance Model 2 (TAM2) to the context of prosocial information sharing in tracing apps. We find that the perceived prosocial benefit of the app, trust in public institutions, and fear of COVID-19 are the relevant predictors. Moreover, we demonstrate that the relation between perceived prosocial benefit and disclosure willingness is moderated by perceived ease of use. Results are discussed with regard to effective implementation and communication strategies for tracing apps, and the general role of prosocial concerns for technology usage to address major societal challenges.","[Joerling, Moritz] Emlyon Business Sch, Mkt Dept, 23 Av Guy Collongue, F-69130 Ecully, France; [Eitze, Sarah; Schmid, Philipp; Betsch, Cornelia] Univ Erfurt, Ctr Empir Res Econ & Behav Sci Media & Commun Sci, Erfurt, Germany; [Betsch, Cornelia] Univ Hamburg, Bernhard Nocht Inst Trop Med, Hamburg, Germany; [Allen, Jennifer] Robert Koch Inst, Dept Epidemiol & Hlth Monitoring, Berlin, Germany; [Boehm, Robert] Univ Vienna, Fac Psychol, Vienna, Austria; [Boehm, Robert] Univ Copenhagen, Copenhagen Ctr Social Data Sci SODAS, Dept Psychol, Copenhagen K, Denmark",EMLYON Business School; University of Erfurt; Bernhard Nocht Institut fur Tropenmedizin; University of Hamburg; Robert Koch Institute; University of Vienna; University of Copenhagen,"Jorling, M (corresponding author), Emlyon Business Sch, Mkt Dept, 23 Av Guy Collongue, F-69130 Ecully, France.",joerling@em-lyon.com,,"Schmid, Philipp/0000-0003-2966-0806; Betsch, Cornelia/0000-0002-2856-7303; Jorling, Moritz/0000-0002-8556-3931; Bohm, Robert/0000-0001-6806-0374",,,,,87,0,0,18,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Research reveals that mere access to networks without active community involvement can fail to empower already marginalized and disenfranchized users. Building upon these findings, this article uses ethnographic methods to explore the meanings of 'network sovereignty' in rural, low-income communities in developing countries. It presents two case studies focused on local network initiatives in Oaxaca, Mexico and Bunda, Tanzania and then offers an assessment matrix to support future network sovereignty research based on five categories: community engagement; local cultures/ontologies; digital education and technological knowledge; economic ownership; and community empowerment. Our comparative research reveals that communities that are able to assert collective ownership over local infrastructure, embed network initiatives within local cultures, and prioritize digital education are much more likely to create and sustain local networks that support their economic, political, and cultural lives.","[Parks, Lisa] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Global Media Technol & Cultures Lab, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Srinivasan, Ramesh] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Informat Studies, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Aragon, Diego Cerna] MIT, Dept Comparat Media Studies, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Parks, L (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Film & Media Studies, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",parks@ucsb.edu; srinivasan@ucla.edu; dcernaa@mit.edu,,"Cerna Aragon, Diego/0000-0002-3345-6974",National Science Foundation [1755106],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),This work was supported by National Science Foundation [grant number 1755106].,,35,0,0,4,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

These modern technologies create a trust challenge, insofar as individuals have to trust data collectors such as private organizations, government institutions, and researchers that their data is not misused. Privacy regulations should increase trust because they provide laws that increase transparency and allow for punishment in cases in which the trustee violates trust. The introduction of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in May 2018 - a wide-reaching regulation in EU law on data protection and privacy that covers millions of individuals in Europe - provides a unique setting to study the impact of privacy regulation on trust in data collectors. We collected survey panel data in Germany around the implementation date and ran a survey experiment with a GDPR information treatment. Our observational and experimental evidence does not support the hypothesis that the GDPR has positively affected trust. This finding and our discussion of the underlying reasons are relevant for the wider research field of trust, privacy, and big data.","[Bauer, Paul C.; Gerdon, Frederic; Keusch, Florian] Univ Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany; [Kreuter, Frauke] Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Kreuter, Frauke] Inst Employment Res, Nurnberg, Germany; [Kreuter, Frauke] Ludwig Maximilian Univ Munich, Munich, Germany; [Vannette, David] Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of Mannheim; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; University of Munich; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Bauer, PC (corresponding author), Univ Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany.",paul.bauer@mzes.uni-mannheim.de; fgerdon@mail.uni-mannheim.de; f.keusch@uni-mannheim.de; frauke.kreuter@stat.uni-muenchen.de; dave.vannette@gmail.com,"Keusch, Florian/Q-8594-2018; Gerdon, Frederic/ABB-3848-2021","Keusch, Florian/0000-0003-1002-4092; Gerdon, Frederic/0000-0003-4442-6698; Kreuter, Frauke/0000-0002-7339-2645; Bauer, Paul Cornelius/0000-0002-8382-9724",German Research Foundation (DFG) through the Collaborative Research Center SFB2 884 'Political Economy of Reforms' [139943784]; Volkswagen Foundation; Pro Unlimited; Facebook,German Research Foundation (DFG) through the Collaborative Research Center SFB2 884 'Political Economy of Reforms'(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Volkswagen Foundation(Volkswagen); Pro Unlimited; Facebook(Facebook Inc),"This work was supported by the German Research Foundation (DFG) through the Collaborative Research Center SFB2 884 'Political Economy of Reforms' (Project A9) [139943784 to Markus Frolich, F.K., and F.K.].

Employing an ethnographic approach, this study examines the digitized resistance of Chinese rural-urban migrant women (n = 41) against sexual harassment faced in their workplaces. We adopt the lens of intersectionality to reveal the nuanced impacts of mobile communication practices negotiated in the context of gender, class, and the organizational structure across informal and formal economies. We find contrasting pictures of bottom-up disruption in the informal labor market and top-down transformation occurring in the modern factory. Migrant women working in the unregulated market restructured the existing patriarchal culture by deploying mobiles to establish collaborative groups for job information sharing. This mobile-mediated sharing enabled the rise of self-employed entrepreneurship, thus avoiding male intermediation in their livelihoods and thereby reducing the chances of encountering harassment. However, these benefits were uneven, with digitally-challenged women missing out. In contrast, migrant women employed in a registered factory with established rules actively negotiated top-down transformation of patriarchal culture. Female managers, in newly gained leadership roles, exercised their professional authority to encourage female workers to re-shape the discursive gender power of mobile spaces shared with male workers. Women actively confronted sexually provocative behavior of men on chat groups. We argue that subtle and covert mobile practices, in addition to visible and direct ones, allow for the construction of digitized female resistance culture as part of broader societal change influenced by mobile communication. We conclude with comments on the complexity and dynamism of mobile-mediated gender transformation in the context of rapid socio-economic development in the Global South..","[Pei, Xin] Univ Nottingham Ningbo China, Sch Int Commun, Ningbo, Peoples R China; [Chib, Arul; Ling, Rich] Nanyang Technol Univ, Wee Kim Wee Sch Commun & Informat, Singapore, Singapore",University of Nottingham Ningbo China; Nanyang Technological University & National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore; Nanyang Technological University,"Chib, A (corresponding author), Nanyang Technol Univ, Wee Kim Wee Sch Commun & Informat, Singapore, Singapore.",arulchib@ntu.edu.sg,,"Chib, Arul/0000-0002-3833-8889; PEI, XIN/0000-0003-3807-2264",Nanyang Technological University [M4081081],Nanyang Technological University(Nanyang Technological University),This work was supported by Nanyang Technological University [grant number: M4081081].,,66,4,4,7,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

In this study, I investigate how social power through algorithms is exercised in media consumption, particularly through curation algorithms. This conceptual paper then contributes to the understanding of social power through algorithms by suggesting the concept of algorithmic meta-capital. The concept derives from Bourdieu's theory on meta-capital which has also been applied to legacy media. I then argue that this algorithmic meta-capital is an extension of the power traditionally held by the state and legacy media. The study also contributes to the understanding of meta-capital as it proposes how the meta-capital possessed by digital intermediaries functions. It does so by legitimating representations of the world and by creating a necessity for algorithmic visibility across different fields, thereby shaping habitus. This Bourdieusian approach enables researchers to take a balanced view on the power of algorithms on the structure/agency continuum.","[Lundahl, Outi] Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, POB 800, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen,"Lundahl, O (corresponding author), Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, POB 800, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands.",o.k.lundahl@rug.nl,,,,,,,69,2,2,21,46,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Our results indicate the influence of parties' structural power position on networked communication: The ecologies around RRPs in government reflect their integration in national discourses and competition. The networks of RRPs in opposition display a self-referential campaign ecology for the promotion and distribution of candidates, content, and positions.

We used agent-based testing to emulate Google searches performed in 17 countries and in 16 different languages as a direct replication and extension of previous work. We compare data collected in 2017 with data collected in 2021. Our analyses revealed that Google searches in English from within the United States still have the highest likelihood of triggering the display of additional crisis-prevention information prominently shown in addition to the regular search results (i.e., Google's suicide-prevention result). Searches in Spanish from within the United States are informationally disadvantaged. Display rates are only slightly lower in other English-speaking countries and when searches are performed in English. While information disparities and digital divides narrowed between 2017 and 2021, substantial differences in the display of crisis-prevention resources remain observable within multilingual countries, especially when other languages compete with English. In Bahrain, South Africa, and Sweden, the crisis-prevention information functionality seems unimplemented. Our findings suggest that the use of automated computational methods is both useful to continuously observe the implementation of new algorithmic functionalities and necessary to hold global media institutions accountable for their actions.","[Scherr, Sebastian] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Commun, Hlth Commun, College Stn, TX USA; [Arendt, Florian] Univ Vienna, Dept Commun, Hlth Commun, Vienna, Austria; [Haim, Mario] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Media & Commun, Commun Sci, Computat Commun Res, Munich, Germany",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; University of Vienna; University of Munich,"Scherr, S (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",scherr@tamu.edu,,"Arendt, Florian/0000-0003-1107-8682",,,,,41,0,0,7,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Artists, however, are not necessarily perceived as political actors and are heard for their political activism only through a legitimacy cross-over from artistic field to political field. In this paper, therefore, we theorize that audience attention has become an important resource for political legitimacy and study how a set of artivists are received on social media. To this end we have analyzed over two million tweets and argue that content on social media platforms such as Twitter provides insight into how people talk about social issues, such as politics and activism. We employ the methods of topic modeling and semantic network analysis to study how Twitter users engage with artivists and find that very few Twitter users are interested in the societal issues that artivists raise. Instead, the majority of tweets in our data involves attention to state prosecution, media-centric artistic recognition and consumerism. These findings indicate that even though some artivists succeed in bringing their activist art to Twitter audiences, political activism that originates from artists is rarely a topic of discussion among Twitter users in terms of its activist content.","[Weij, Frank; Berkers, Pauwke] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Hist Culture & Commun, Dept Arts & Culture Studies, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Berkers, P (corresponding author), Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Hist Culture & Commun, Dept Arts & Culture Studies, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.",berkers@eshcc.eur.nl,,"Berkers, Pauwke/0000-0002-8132-6007",NWO [NWO - PGW-15-23],NWO(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)),This work was supported by NWO [Grant Number NWO - PGW-15-23].,,49,0,0,5,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Funded under the European Commission's Horizon 2020 programme, the system is analysed in relation to the wider political economy of 'emotional AI' and the history of deception detection technologies. We then move on to interrogate the design of iBorderCtrl using publicly available documents and assess the assumptions and scientific validation underpinning the project design. Finally, drawing on a Bayesian analysis we outline statistical fallacies in the foundational premise of mass screening and argue that it is very unlikely that the model that iBorderCtrl provides for deception detection would work in practice. By interrogating actual systems in this way, we argue that we can begin to question the very premise of the development of data-driven systems, and emotional AI and deception detection in particular, pushing back on the assumption that these systems are fulfilling the tasks they claim to be attending to and instead ask what function such projects carry out in the creation of subjects and management of populations.

The embedding of social media platforms into peoples' daily routines has blurred the boundaries between work and non-work domains. This presents a host of ethical, legal, and moral challenges pitting the rights and interests of employees against the authority and power of employers. In seeking to investigate whether, and the extent to which, employees' off-duty expression is becoming subject to increasing employer control we conducted a systematic content analysis of Canadian judicial opinions from some 50 arbitration and court decisions involving the porous boundary between employees' off-duty and work lives. The findings offer insights into the governance trajectory being charted by jurisdictional expressions in Canada that deal with reconciling employees' right to freedom of expression with their contractual obligation to avoid harming employers' public reputation. The analysis shows that employers are seeking to impose strong disciplinary measures for employee off-duty social media postings they deem contrary to their interests, and that adjudicators are upholding the imposing of such discipline while mitigating employer disciplinary excesses. These observations suggest the classic dichotomy between owners' time and own time is being reconfigured into a distinction between owners' time/space and one's own tethered time/space. The recent introduction of 'right to disconnect' legislation offers labour unions a unique opportunity to develop collective bargaining proposals aimed at eliminating the tethering of employees' time/space and better protecting their off-duty expression.","[Pare, Daniel J.] Univ Ottawa, Dept Commun, 55 Laurier Ave East, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada; [Smith, Charles] Univ Saskatchewan, St Thomas Moore Coll, Dept Polit Sci, Saskatoon, SK, Canada",University of Ottawa; University of Saskatchewan,"Pare, DJ (corresponding author), Univ Ottawa, Dept Commun, 55 Laurier Ave East, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada.",daniel.pare@uottawa.ca; csmith@stmcollege.ca,,,"Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council, Canada [430-2018-00880]","Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council, Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC))","This work was supported by an Insight Development Grant from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council, Canada [grant number 430-2018-00880].",,80,0,0,2,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

What is behind this interdependence, and how does it manifest in news texts? We argue that social media platforms (and Twitter in particular) have situated themselves as purveyors of legitimated content, a projection that journalists have not fully challenged and at times abetted. Instead, journalists rely on these platforms both for access to powerful users and as conduits to surface the words of 'ordinary people.' This practice treats tweets more like content, an interchangeable building block of news, than like sources, whose ideas and messages must be verified. Using a corpus of U.S. news stories with tweets in them, we provide empirical evidence for our argument of the power of platforms to legitimate speech and shape journalism. This study illuminates journalists' role in transferring some of the press's authority to Twitter, thereby shaping the participants in and content of public deliberation.","[Molyneux, Logan] Temple Univ, Klein Coll Media & Commun, 2020 N 13th St, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA; [McGregor, Shannon C.] Univ N Carolina, Hussman Sch Journalism & Media, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,"Molyneux, L (corresponding author), Temple Univ, Klein Coll Media & Commun, 2020 N 13th St, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA.",logan@temple.edu,"Molyneux, Logan/I-9791-2019","Molyneux, Logan/0000-0001-7382-3065; McGregor, Shannon/0000-0002-3275-0397",,,,,60,8,9,8,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

We conceptualize engagement in the sharing economy as a form of online participation, and apply a digital inequalities perspective to examine the social stratification of commercial sharing. Based on the Internet access model established by Van Dijk, we analyze the effects of social structural antecedents on various access stages. Initial studies indicate that the sharing economy is characterized by second-order consumption, addressing user wants more than needs. Therefore, we draw on Bourdieu to complement Van Dijk's model through a habitual perspective. Analyzing data collected in a survey of more than 6000 individuals from 12 European countries, we find that while social structural antecedents are critical in explaining initial usage of sharing services, their effect on repeat usage is less evident. Some indicators, such as education and social capital, even negatively relate to usage intensity. In turn, we find that a habitus of innovativeness and community-orientation significantly bolsters initial usage, but materialism, rather than material requirements, characterizes higher levels of engagement in the sharing economy.","[Eichhorn, Thomas; Juerss, Sebastian] Univ Leipzig, Inst Commun & Media Studies, Leipzig, Saxony, Germany; [Hoffmann, Christian P.] Univ Leipzig, Inst Commun & Media Studies, Commun Management, Leipzig, Saxony, Germany",Leipzig University; Leipzig University,"Eichhorn, T (corresponding author), Univ Leipzig, Inst Commun & Media Studies, Leipzig, Saxony, Germany.",thomas.eichhorn@uni-leipzig.de,,,H2020 LEIT Information and Communication Technologies [732117],H2020 LEIT Information and Communication Technologies,This work was supported by H2020 LEIT Information and Communication Technologies [grant number 732117].,,66,8,8,5,46,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

As a result, the once ostensibly uniform content moderation practices of social media companies are becoming increasingly territorialized, and the governance of online political speech is constantly negotiated between global social media platforms and national governments. To comprehend the evolving landscape of online political speech governance, this paper scrutinizes how Facebook has adapted its content moderation practices to the political and legal contexts of three democratic nations: the United States, Germany, and South Korea. We assessed national laws and governmental documents to explain the regulatory landscapes of the three countries, and used VPNs and corporate PR materials to see how Facebook's platform design and public communication diverge by location. The findings suggest that the seemingly 'splintering' regulatory frameworks still have a 'centralizing' effect: Facebook formally complies with national laws, but its platform interface and communication activities steer users away from the local systems and towards its centralized operations. We discuss future implications for the regulation of online political speech in democratic nations.","[Ahn, Soyun] Univ Southern Calif, Annenberg Sch Commun, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Baik, Jeeyun (Sophia)] Univ San Diego, San Diego, CA USA; [Krause, Clara Sol] European Commission, Directorate Gen Communicat Networks, Content & Technol, Brussels, Belgium",University of Southern California; University of San Diego,"Ahn, S (corresponding author), Univ Southern Calif, Annenberg Sch Commun & Journalism, Los Angeles, CA USA.",soyunahn@usc.edu,,"Ahn, So Yun/0000-0002-3677-0299; Baik, Jeeyun (Sophia)/0000-0001-5057-1432",,,,,55,0,0,5,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

However, the phenomenon is far from being fully conceptualized or effectively measured. The key question, whether digital divide is a mere extension of other social inequalities, or it has significant new meaning, remains largely unanswered; a reason is the lack of effective instruments of quantitative study of the phenomenon that would capture its complex nature. The present paper addresses both conceptualizing and measurement issues, suggesting that separation of supply- and demand-side considerations is crucial in understanding the digital divide and introducing a composite Digital Life Index, measures separately the digital supply and demand across seven independent dimensions. The Index is based on Internet-borne data, a distinction from traditional research approaches that rely on official statistics or surveys. Though the empiric part of the paper is focused on the sub-national digital divide in Russia we argue that its methodology can be applied on many other levels and its conceptual findings are relevant to understanding the phenomenon globally. The hierarchical regression analysis is used to determine the relative importance of factors like income, human capital, and policy in shaping the digital divide. The result of the analysis suggests that the digital divide is driven more by the differences in demand than in supply; the role of income is insignificant, and the quality of policy and human capital is the key determinant of the divide. The paper advances the existing conceptual and methodological literature on the issue and can also inform practical decision-making regarding the strategies of national and regional digital development.","[Korovkin, Vladimir] Moscow Sch Management SKOLKOVO, Skolkovo, Russia; [Park, Albert] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Inst Emerging Markets Studies, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Kaganer, Evgeny] IESE Business Sch, Barcelona, Spain",Hong Kong University of Science & Technology; University of Navarra; IESE Business School,"Korovkin, V (corresponding author), Moscow Sch Management SKOLKOVO, Skolkovo, Russia.",Vladimir_korovkin@skolkovo.ru,"Korovkin, Vladimir/V-4347-2018","Korovkin, Vladimir/0000-0002-0068-9544",,,,,174,0,0,29,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

To examine these dimensions, we analysed the 100 most circulated TikTok videos and associated comments depicting victims of police brutality using the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag through multimodal critical discourse analysis. We identified how users attempted to increase visibility of their content, and how this was supported or criticised by commenters depending on the perceived motives of these efforts. Furthermore, we showcased how influencers raised awareness of the movement with little personal effort or risk, sometimes appearing to leverage the movement for self-exposure. Our analysis showed that many of the most liked videos were made by white content creators who, in their videos, seemed to be addressing an imagined white audience. While these efforts portrayed the movement favourably, the content creators remain outsiders who have not themselves been in harm's way of police brutality. While there were exceptions that promoted the perspectives of marginalised communities, and while the white narratives were consistently supportive of the movement, they also work to displace focus on racial (in)justice away from those directly affected by it, that is, away from Black people's own experiences of police brutality. We discuss these findings in relation to questions about digital representations of Black victimhood, digital visibility and practices of whiteness, on TikTok and beyond.","[Krutrok, Moa Eriksson; Akerlund, Mathilda] Umea Univ, Dept Culture & Media Studies, Humanities Bldg,Biblioteksgrand 3, S-90187 Umea, Sweden",Umea University,"Krutrok, ME (corresponding author), Umea Univ, Dept Culture & Media Studies, Humanities Bldg,Biblioteksgrand 3, S-90187 Umea, Sweden.",moa.eriksson.krutrok@umu.se,,"Eriksson Krutrok, Moa/0000-0003-3665-2476",Swedish Crime Victims Authority [09413/2020],Swedish Crime Victims Authority,This work was supported by Swedish Crime Victims Authority [grant number 09413/2020].,,61,3,3,11,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

We find evidence of a significant negative impact of internal migration on generalized trust. We also investigate the moderating role of Internet use, and find that whilst Internet use significantly attenuates the negative impact on generalized trust of internal migration, this moderating effect is much stronger for urban-to-urban migrants than it is for rural-to-urban migrants. The results further indicate that internal migration in China has led to the deterioration of subjective well-being, changing perceptions of fairness, increased likelihood of downward social mobility, and deterioration in social relations, which we interpret as potential mechanisms behind our findings.","[Lu, Haiyang] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, West Ctr Econ Res, 555 Liutai Ave, Chengdu 611130, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Kandilov, Ivan T.] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Raleigh, NC USA",Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China; University of North Carolina; North Carolina State University,"Lu, HY (corresponding author), Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, West Ctr Econ Res, 555 Liutai Ave, Chengdu 611130, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",luhy@swufe.edu.cn,"Lu, Haiyang/AAB-1478-2019","Lu, Haiyang/0000-0001-5789-2319",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71603052],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This study was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant number 71603052).,,57,0,0,11,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

With the resources afforded by the Web, a brand-new way of linking up words and images, text and visual sources, has become possible, providing the study of history and memory with unexplored tracts of promising terrain. But the importance of this emerging material is not just to do with historical knowledge and methodology. Its main contribution is political: the persecutors and the victims of those years have spoken out, they have deposited their memories online, exercising a faculty that the Cultural Revolution and post-Maoist political institutions had denied them for decades. Through the bottom-up perspective that the Internet provides, the historical protagonists have been able to bear witness in potential perpetuity without needing the researcher's mediation. By speaking directly to the public, the witnesses cease to be merely pieces of the past. They are not just victims or perpetrators who condemn past deeds, but, as the actors who made and endured history, they can turn themselves from passive historical figures into active political agents.","[Tesini, Mario] Univ Parma, Dipartimento Discipline Umanist Sociali & Imprese, Parma, Italy; [Zambernardi, Lorenzo] Univ Bologna, Dipartimento Sci Polit & Sociali, Bologna, Italy",University of Parma; University of Bologna,"Zambernardi, L (corresponding author), Univ Bologna, Dipartimento Sci Polit & Sociali, Bologna, Italy.",lorenzo.zambernardi3@unibo.it,,"ZAMBERNARDI, LORENZO/0000-0003-3232-5320",,,,,69,1,1,3,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

We find that mobile phones have become identification technologies central to both migrants' survival and border infrastructures' attempts to deter cross-border mobility with profound consequences for human life and agency.

However, what is meant by the 'subject' is not neutral and subjectification can differ according to cultural context. This study takes Middle Eastern women influencers' subjectification on TikTok as a case to illustrate postdigital transnational subjectification. The novel framework of feminist postdigital transnational inquiry is applied to the corpus assisted study of three Middle Eastern women influencers' short-form TikTok videos. The findings reveal observable audio-visual elements while embedding conceptual meanings surrounding subjectification. Discussion postulates subjectification on TikTok as living postdigital practices with transnational meanings both within and beyond their immediate context. It is suggested that subjectification could occur beyond regional, generational, traditional, fixed or essentialist terms. Theorising offers nuanced insights into the curatorial potential of TikTok for subjectification as consecutively interdependent with contextual issues, trends and deeper traditional audio-visual ontologies. At the same time, it suggests that platforms' transnational affordances in Global South contexts occur independently to Northcentric frameworks and interpretations.","[Hurley, Zoe] Zayed Univ, Coll Commun & Media Sci, Dubai, U Arab Emirates",Zayed University,"Hurley, Z (corresponding author), Zayed Univ, Dubai, U Arab Emirates.",zoe.hurley@zu.ac.ae,"Hurley, Zoe/GSO-3933-2022; Hurley, Zoe/AFS-0568-2022","Hurley, Zoe/0000-0002-9870-8677",,,,,54,0,0,6,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Based on analyzing court rulings, exchanges with the Parliamentary Ombudsmen and in-depth interviews, the article shows how different, partly conflicting definitions of what automated decision-making in social services is and does, are negotiated between the municipality, a union for social workers and civil servants and journalists.

Using a combination of qualitative and computational methods, 140,000 AI-related articles published between 2015 and 2018 were studied. Findings reveal that AI-related discourse on WeChat is surprisingly similar to that on People's Daily Online. That is, it is dominated by industry and political actors, such as government agencies and technology companies, and is mostly characterised by discussions about the economic potential of the technology, with strongly positive evaluations, and little critical debate.","[Zeng, Jing; Schafer, Mike S.] Univ Zurich, Dept Commun & Media Res, Zurich, Switzerland; [Chan, Chung-hong] Univ Mannheim, Mannheim Ctr European Social Res, Mannheim, Germany",University of Zurich; University of Mannheim,"Zeng, J (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Dept Commun & Media Res, Zurich, Switzerland.",j.zeng@ikmz.uzh.ch,"Schafer, Mike/F-7238-2010; Chan, Chung-hong/D-6946-2013","Schafer, Mike/0000-0002-0847-7503; Chan, Chung-hong/0000-0002-6232-7530; ZENG, JING/0000-0001-5970-7172",,,,,60,9,9,15,52,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

The geographical information embedded in digital collections - such as where objects were made or the locations they depict and describe - can help varied audiences to discover digital heritage records that are significant to them. Yet the interactive web maps used by cultural heritage organisations have not presented the breadth of collections effectively. Audience research conducted by the Locating a National Collection project offered insights into how the presentation of local heritage using web maps can broaden engagement. A survey explored the values, motivations and identities of the UK public in relation to geography and web technologies. 'Pretotypes' or sketches of interfaces prompted focus groups to offer insights into interface design and the suitability of collections. The public were not only interested in heritage connected to the area where they reside but also a range of familiar locations drawn from memory, genealogy and community, termed their 'own places'. Only particular collections offer geographical information of suitable quality and distribution to support engagement with familiar locations at a local scale. This user-centred approach can help organisations to design web maps that help audiences discover the parts of collections they find meaningful. The article offers the first step in a pathway to achieving social impact such as community building through digital collections.","[Rees, Gethin] British Lib, Contemporary British Publicat, 96 Euston Rd, London NW1 2DB, England; [Hunt, Alex] Natl Trust, Swindon, Wilts, England; [Vitale, Valeria] Alan Turing Inst, London, England; [Horgan, John; Strachan, Peter] STRAT7 ResearchBods, London, England",,"Rees, G (corresponding author), British Lib, Contemporary British Publicat, 96 Euston Rd, London NW1 2DB, England.",dr.gethin.rees@gmail.com; alex.hunt@nationaltrust.org.uk; vvitale@turing.ac.uk; jhorgan@researchbods.com; pstrachan@researchbods.com,,,Arts and Humanities Research Council [AH/T01119X/1],Arts and Humanities Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC)),This work was supported by the Arts and Humanities Research Council under grant number AH/T01119X/1.,,45,0,0,7,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

This study examines the relation of PSMU with economic inequality, measured at country, school and individual levels. It also evaluated the moderating role of family and peer support in these associations. The 2017/18 Health Behavior in School-aged Children (HBSC) study measured PSMU in 179,049 adolescents aged 11-, 13- and 15-year-olds in 43 countries and sub-regions of Belgium (Flanders and Wallonia) and the United Kingdom (England, Scotland, and Wales). Associations between inequality and PSMU were tested using multilevel logistic regression analyis. Results showed that adolescents who were relatively more deprived than their schoolmates and attended more economically unequal schools had a higher likelihood of reporting PSMU. In addition, school wealth inequality was more closely related to PSMU among adolescents with lower levels of peer support. A similar effect of country income inequality was found, but only in adolescents who reported low family support. Our findings expand the existing literature on the detrimental impact of inequalities in different social contexts on adolescent wellbeing by showing the role of inequalities in the engagement in PSMU.","[Lenzi, Michela; Marino, Claudia; Canale, Natale; Vieno, Alessio] Univ Padua, Dept Dev & Social Psychol, Via Venezia 8, I-35131 Padua, Italy; [Elgar, Frank J.] McGill Univ, Sch Populat & Global Hlth, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Berchialla, Paola] Univ Torino, Dept Clin & Biol Sci, Turin, Italy; [Stevens, Gonneke W.

A large number of studies from the social and behavioral sciences have investigated the antecedents, types, and consequences of its use. In addition or as an alternative to self-reports from users, many studies have used data from the platform itself, usually collected via its Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). However, with the drastic reduction of data access via the Facebook APIs following the Cambridge Analytica scandal, this data source has essentially become unavailable to academic researchers. Hence, there is a need for different modes of data access for what Freelon (2018) has called the 'post-API age'. One promising approach is to directly collaborate with platform users to ask them to share (parts of) their personal Facebook data with researchers. This paper presents experiences from two studies employing such approaches. The first used a browser plugin to unobtrusively observe Facebook use while users are active. The second asked participants to export and share parts of their personal Facebook data archive. While both approaches yield promising insights suitable to extend or replace self-reports, both also entail specific limitations. We discuss and compare the unique advantages and limitations of both approaches and provide a list of recommendations for future research.","[Breuer, Johannes] GESIS Leibniz Inst Social Sci, Survey Data Curat, Cologne, Germany; [Breuer, Johannes] Ctr Adv Internet Studies, Res Data & Methods, Bochum, Germany; [Kmetty, Zoltan] Eotvos Lorand Univ, Fac Social Sci, Budapest, Hungary; [Kmetty, Zoltan] Hungarian Acad Sci, CSS Recens Res Grp, Ctr Social Sci, Budapest, Hungary; [Haim, Mario] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Media & Commun, Munich, Germany; [Stier, Sebastian] GESIS Leibniz Inst Social Sci, Computat Social Sci, Cologne, Germany",Leibniz Institut fur Sozialwissenschaften (GESIS); Eotvos Lorand University; Hungarian Academy of Sciences; Hungarian Centre for Social Sciences; University of Munich; Leibniz Institut fur Sozialwissenschaften (GESIS),"Breuer, J (corresponding author), GESIS Leibniz Inst Social Sci, Survey Data Curat, Cologne, Germany.;Breuer, J (corresponding author), Ctr Adv Internet Studies, Res Data & Methods, Bochum, Germany.",johannes.breuer@gesis.org,"Breuer, Johannes/I-9514-2019","Breuer, Johannes/0000-0001-5906-7873",,,,,34,0,0,5,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Firstly, this is the first misinformation audit not to implement a national but a cross-national research design. Secondly, it retrieves results not in response to the most popular query terms. Instead, it theorizes two semantic dimensions of search terms and illustrates how they impact the number of misinformative results returned. Furthermore, the analysis not only captures the mere presence of misinformative content but in addition whether the source websites are affiliated with a key misinformation actor (Russia's ruling elites) and whom the conspiracy narratives cast as the malicious plotters. Empirically, the audit compares Covid-19 conspiracy theories in Google search results across 5 key target countries of Russia's foreign communication (Belarus, Estonia, Germany, Ukraine, and the US) and Russia as of November 2020 (N = 5280 search results). it finds that, across all countries, primarily content published by mass media organizations rendered conspiracy theories visible in search results. Conspiratorial content published on websites affiliated with Russia's ruling elites was retrieved in the Belarusian, German and Russian contexts. Across all countries, the majority of conspiracy narratives suspected plotters from China. Malicious actors from the US were insinuated exclusively by sources affiliated with Russia's elites. Overall, conspiracy narratives did not primarily deepen divides within but between national communities, since across all countries - only plotters from beyond the nation& borders were blamed.

This increasingly popularity of Zoom has led to growing debates about its negative health impacts. In particular, 'Zoom fatigue' is a rapidly popularizing phenomena that describes the mental exhaustion or burnout arising from Zoom use. However, the specific mechanisms through which Zoom leads to Zoom fatigue are not well understood. To fill this gap, this study tested a mediated model linking Zoom use with the camera on ('ZUC') to Zoom fatigue, through the mediator of social interaction anxiety on Zoom, with a survey sample from the United Kingdom. It was also posited that self-monitoring positively moderated the effects of ZUC on social interaction anxiety on Zoom. The results demonstrated that the direct effects of ZUC on Zoom fatigue was significant and positive. The paper also showed that social interaction anxiety on Zoom increased Zoom fatigue. However, ZUC failed to indirectly increase Zoom fatigue due to the insignificant effects of ZUC on social interaction anxiety on Zoom. Self-monitoring also did not moderate the insignificant relationship between ZUC and social interaction anxiety on Zoom.

Parent involvement has been recommended as a prevention strategy; it remains unclear how it is associated with media use and health outcomes. The purpose of this study was to develop profiles of media use, parent involvement and health outcomes among adolescents. Early adolescents were recruited to a cross-sectional online survey using the Qualtrics platform and panels. Media use measures included ownership and bedroom use of devices, social media platforms and video games. Parent media involvement assessed media rules and role-modeling. Health measures included physical activity, sleep and PIU. We used latent class analysis (LCA) to identify distinct profile groups across these three areas. The 1155 participants had a mean age of 13.6 years (SD = 1.1), of whom 49.7% were female, 73.7% were White and 61.1% had parent education with a college degree. We found that most participants owned personal media devices, including smartphones (81.4%), computers (64.6%) and video game systems (58.9%). The LCA identified three distinct profile groups: (1) Active Autonomous Media Users, (2) Young Low-Tech Sleepers and (3) Risky Regulated Media Users. Findings support that media use patterns vary across adolescents, suggesting different education and prevention approaches may be needed. Targeting educational messages to different media profiles may be an effective strategy to optimize productive media use and health.","[Moreno, Megan A.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Pediat, 2870 Univ Ave,Suite 200,Mailcode 9010, Madison, WI 53705 USA; [Gower, Aubrey D.] Univ Washington, Sch Med, Seattle, WA USA; [Pham, Daniel] Univ Washington, Dept Biostat, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Zhao, Qianqian; Eickhoff, Jens] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Biostat & Informat, Madison, WI USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Moreno, MA (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Pediat, 2870 Univ Ave,Suite 200,Mailcode 9010, Madison, WI 53705 USA.",moreno@wisc.edu,,,"Seattle Children's Research Institute; Center for Child Health, Behavior and Development","Seattle Children's Research Institute; Center for Child Health, Behavior and Development","Funding for this project was provided by Seattle Children's Research Institute; Center for Child Health, Behavior and Development.",,54,2,2,8,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

This project qualitatively explores US college students' exposure to and experiences with content on social media that they consider to be related to race and racial discrimination. Based on analysis of focus groups, we highlight the role of digital documentation, mediated spillover, and platform collapse as key processes in propagation and communication visibility of racial discourses. We begin by delineating first level-digital documentation that digitally captures local campus and national events from second-level digital documentation - the copying of already digitized content (e.g., via screenshotting). We then introduce the concept of 'platform collapse' - second-level digital documentation that enables mediated spillover of content in ways that disrupt discourse architectures, affordances, and audience contexts. Platform collapse emerged in student discussions of how content was documented and moved from relatively private to more public spaces to call attention to racist events, messages, and behavior, and to spur conversations and action. This extended reach and frequency, and also changed the context of racial discourses. Conversely, there was also evidence of platform collapse where content was moved from public to more private spaces to address social groundlessness and avoid masspersonal engagement on social media. We conclude by discussing implications of digital documentation and platform collapse for communication theory and methods.","[Bigman, Cabral A.] Univ Illinois, Dept Commun, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Planey, Arrianna Marie] Univ N Carolina, Gillings Sch Global Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA; [Williamson, Lillie D.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Commun Arts, Madison, WI USA; [Smith, Marisa A.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Advertising Publ Relat, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Smith, Sharde McNeil] Univ Illinois, Dept Human Dev & Family Studies, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; Michigan State University; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Bigman, CA (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Coll Liberal Arts & Sci, Dept Commun, Lincoln Hall,702 S Wright St, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",cbigman@illinois.edu,,"McNeil Smith, Sharde/0000-0002-9310-2369; Planey, Arrianna Marie/0000-0003-4739-090X; Bigman, Cabral/0000-0002-4510-7878; Williamson, Lillie/0000-0001-5735-1416; Smith, Marisa/0000-0001-8517-4998",Funding Initiative for Multiracial Democracy at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,Funding Initiative for Multiracial Democracy at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,This research was supported by the Funding Initiative for Multiracial Democracy at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

In addition, by setting the respondents' political orientation as the moderator, conditional indirect effect of CSR authenticity was further confirmed. An online survey was conducted on of Korean Naver users who actively use Internet portal services. Among the various CSR efforts of IPOs, strengthening of democratic contributions, universal service delivery, and consumer protection were shown to increase both cognitive and socio-political legitimacy through CSR authenticity. In particular, the effect of CSR efforts on cognitive legitimacy through perception of CSR authenticity was significantly higher in users with progressive political orientation.

The study contributes to the scarce research on the reception of narratives transmitted by the Russian state-supported media platforms RT and Sputnik, exposing characteristics, political attitudes, and sharing behaviors of RT/Sputnik consumers. A nationwide, representative survey (n: 3033) from November 2020 revealed a surprisingly high number of Swedish RT/Sputnik consumers (7%), with an overrepresentation of young, men and supports of non-parliamentarian parties and the right wing, nationalist Sweden Democratic Party. These consumers are somewhat more willing than non-consumers to disseminate news on social media and in real life despite being distrustful of the sources. The findings strengthen previous research in demonstrating the attractiveness of identity grievance narratives among alternative media consumers, yet the results show that RT/Sputnik consumers also aligned with narratives that contrasts with national security policy. They state less trust in politicians, institutions, the media, news, and journalism, yet are comparatively prone to share unreliable or untrue news content on social media and in real life. The analysis thus identified a section of media consumers who can function as vehicles for the dissemination of MII. The article contributes to the under-researched problem of the potential of MII to take root and provides a basis for future qualitative research that can refine and provide nuance to the knowledge of reception of MII.","[Wagnsson, Charlotte] Swedish Def Univ, Box 278 05115 93, Stockholm, Sweden",,"Wagnsson, C (corresponding author), Swedish Def Univ, Box 278 05115 93, Stockholm, Sweden.",charlotte.wagnsson@fhs.se,,,Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency,Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency,This work was supported by the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency.,,56,1,1,4,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

In-depth interviews with Generation Z, who heavily use Instagram, identify visual and verbal elements of politicians' Instagram posts that they consider influential on their beliefs and actions. Responses reveal several elements, including two that expand the contours of what constitutes persuasive political personalization. Successful personalization includes politicians participating in two-way conversations with followers and adopting a backstage pass aesthetic when showing what politicians do on the job and how they feel about it.

The empirical research has followed the #Occupy and #Anonymous hashtags around popular social media, reconstructing their highly heterogeneous adoption. A branding perspective on contentious politics is aimed at highlighting the diverse and sometimes contradictory appropriations of the 'semiotic repertoires' of protest movements, particularly apparent within digital networks of communication. A contentious branding perspective on social movements not only tries to fit these specific cases better: it intends to provide an epistemological and methodological device to sustain a non-essentialist understanding of social movements in general, and to face the challenges and opportunities of digital social movement research in particular. The first section of the paper briefly discusses the concepts 'social movement' and 'branding', characterizing the proposed idea of 'contentious branding'. Some insights derived from a broader digital exploration on the uses of the hashtags #Occupy and #Anonymous then serve to emphasize their variable, incoherent and at times contradictory utilization: few of the several reiterations of the brand Occupy, deviating from its original use, are presented, and a heuristic categorization of Anonymous' diverse issues of involvement is proposed. Based on this, the discussion further develops the concept of contentious branding, clarifying its analytical boundaries vis a vis neighboring approaches in social movement theory. The conclusion discusses some of the epistemological and methodological implications that contentious branding bears for the study of social movements in the digital age.","[Beraldo, Davide] Univ Amsterdam, Dept Media Studies, Turfdraagsterpad 9, NL-1012 XT Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam,"Beraldo, D (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Dept Media Studies, Turfdraagsterpad 9, NL-1012 XT Amsterdam, Netherlands.",d.beraldo@uva.nl,,,,,,,43,2,2,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

The results of the regression analysis evidence the moderating role of the internet on the relationship between living alone and feelings of loneliness in individuals aged 50 and over, so that the impact of living alone on loneliness is diminished for internet users as compared to their peers who do not use the internet. The results therefore reinforce the importance of policies aimed at fostering e-inclusion as a way of reducing the loneliness of older adults.","[Silva, Patricia] Univ Minho, Commun & Soc Res Ctr, Inst Social Sci, Braga, Portugal; [Matos, Alice Delerue] Univ Minho, Dept Sociol & Commun, Inst Social Sci, Braga, Portugal; [Matos, Alice Delerue] Univ Minho, Soc Res Ctr, Inst Social Sci, Braga, Portugal; [Martinez-Pecino, Roberto] Univ Seville, Dept Social Psychol, Seville, Spain",Universidade do Minho; Universidade do Minho; Universidade do Minho; University of Sevilla,"Silva, P (corresponding author), Univ Minho, Commun & Soc Res Ctr, Social Sci Inst, Campus Gualtar, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal.",patriciasilva@ics.uminho.pt,"Delerue Matos, Alice/AAC-3838-2020; Martinez-Pecino, Roberto/L-1294-2014","Delerue Matos, Alice/0000-0002-2394-4077; Martinez-Pecino, Roberto/0000-0003-0765-1407; Silva, Patricia/0000-0003-4074-5368",European Commission; Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia; U.S National Institute on Aging; Fundacao Calouste Gulbenkian; German Ministry of Education and Research,European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre); Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia(Portuguese Foundation for Science and TechnologyEuropean Commission); U.S National Institute on Aging(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)); Fundacao Calouste Gulbenkian(European Commission); German Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),This work was supported by European Commission; Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia; U.S National Institute on Aging; Fundacao Calouste Gulbenkian; German Ministry of Education and Research.,,107,13,14,13,54,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

In the current study, we examine whether organizational expectations towards after-hours communications for work purposes (off-job e-communication expectations) and perceptions of technology as causing family conflict (technology to family conflict), may be experienced differently by two generations of employees. Moreover, segmentation preference is examined as a moderator of the relationship between off-job e-communication expectations and technology to family conflict. Data from 238 employees that reported to have used, over the last 6 months, their ICT for work purposes during non-work time, from various industries were collected. Findings revealed that segmentation preferences are related to technology to family conflict directly for both groups.

By analyzing private chat logs of the group administrators, we explore the group's organizationality and the ways in which organizational and interactional communication become intertwined to produce and curate digital political discussions. Our findings illustrate how technological affordances built for moderation also support the strategic organization of discussions to orchestrate political talk.

In doing so, we provide an account of the ways in which the technology affects how babies and parents' bodies are (re)imagined, assessed, controlled, interrelated, experienced, and cared for and move beyond generic social debate around the quantified-objectified baby and fears of touch deprivation in contemporary digital culture.","[Leder Mackley, Kerstin; Jewitt, Carey; Price, Sara] UCL, UCL Knowledge Lab, Culture Commun & Media, 23-29 Emerald St, London WC1N 3QS, England",University of London; University College London; UCL Institute of Education,"Jewitt, C (corresponding author), UCL, UCL Knowledge Lab, Culture Commun & Media, 23-29 Emerald St, London WC1N 3QS, England.",c.jewitt@ucl.ac.uk,"Price, Sara/AAG-5856-2021","Price, Sara/0000-0002-5092-1663",European Research Council [681489],European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)European Commission),This work was supported by H2020 European Research Council Consolidator Award [grant number 681489].,,34,2,2,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

One challenge facing such protest campaigns is how internal disagreements about key issues can be resolved or contained. To what extent can movement participants handle disagreements constructively through digital communication? This article addresses this question through a case study of online discussions surrounding the political consumerism campaign during the Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill Movement in Hong Kong. Qualitative content analysis illustrates the range of disagreements that could arise in a self-directed political consumerism campaign and uncovers the various types of engaging and disengaging communications that people practiced. Quantitative content analysis shows that disengaging communications were more common, yet people were more responsive to engaging communications. The latter was more obvious as the campaign proceeded. Implications of the findings on the capability of decentralized protests to resolve internal differences are discussed.","[Fong, Ivy W.

We identify two major narratives concerning Transsion's FRT patenting practice. First is 'empowerment', through which Transsion argues that there are 'blind spots' in conventional AI technologies and presents its AI camera as a remedy and an empowerment tool for dark-skinned users by 'seeing' their beauty. Second is the 'warfare' narrative, which is shaped by the heightening market competition and accelerating patent races among Chinese phone makers. As the battle for tech supremacy intensifies in Africa, Transsion expresses a strong sense of crisis and considers its FRT patents as 'weapons of competition' in preparation for a future smartphone warfare in Africa. This study makes two contributions. Empirically, through analyzing patents, we examine a relatively less-known Chinese tech company that has tremendous impact in the Global South. Theoretically, we interrogate the possibility of algorithmic empowerment against racist AI and technological independence through patents, although developing AI as weaponry, in the China-Africa context, also hampers the politics of decolonization.","[Lu, Miao] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Sch Journalism & Commun, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Qiu, Jack Linchuan] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Commun & New Media, Singapore, Singapore",Chinese University of Hong Kong; National University of Singapore,"Lu, M (corresponding author), Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Sch Journalism & Commun, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",miaolu@cuhk.edu.hk,,"LU, MIAO/0000-0001-8455-8308",,,,,53,1,1,4,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

The study of children's mediatised activities within epidemic isolation can be approached from the perspective of radical contextualism, which has been widely used since the ethnographic turn in audience research that began in the late 1980s. Following this conceptual framework, the aim of the study is to identify the predominant experiences of isolated everyday life in a case study of schoolchildren and uncover typical collective groupings among young people. Based on a follow the child perspective, an online survey was conducted at a selected primary school, targeting children from 6th to 9th grade, to capture children's perceptions of online education and distance learning, prevalent digital use and their personal digital positioning. In an analytical sense, the collected sample of 110 schoolchildren was categorised using a cluster analysis to identify the typical scenarios of digital culture and show the diversity of online practices that children experienced during the COVID-19 isolation, even in a relatively homogeneous group of schoolchildren.","[Crnic, Tanja Oblak; Brecko, Barbara Neza] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Social Sci, Ljubljana, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana,"Crnic, TO (corresponding author), Univ Ljubljana, Fac Social Sci, Ljubljana, Slovenia.",tanja.oblak@fdv.uni-lj.si,,,"Slovenian Research Agency [P5-0136, P5-0399, J52564]",Slovenian Research Agency(Slovenian Research Agency - Slovenia),"This work was supported by Slovenian Research Agency: [Grant Number P5-0136, P5-0399, J52564].",,67,0,0,3,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Participants (n (study 1) = 69 (32 men, mean age = 20.83), n (study 2) = 119 (61 men, mean age = 20.09)) played either a sexist or non-sexist video game. We measured subsequently implicit association of self with masculinity, women's objectification (measured with two different measurements in Study1 and 2) and identification with video game character. Results showed that greater identification with video game character predicted stronger association between self-concept and masculinity but not with women's objectification. Thus, it seems that identification with video game character may play an important role in video games' influence.","[Sarda, Elisa; Begue, Laurent] Univ Grenoble Alpes, LIP PC2S, Grenoble, France; [Zerhouni, Oulmann] Univ Paris Nanterre, LAPPS, Nanterre, France; [Gentile, Douglas A.] Iowa State Univ, Ames, IA USA; [Bry, Clementine] Univ Savoie Mt Blanc, LIP PC2S, Chambery, France",Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Iowa State University,"Sarda, E (corresponding author), Univ Grenoble Alpes, LIP PC2S, Grenoble, France.",sarda.ely@gmail.com,,"Zerhouni, Oulmann/0000-0002-4026-1921",Mission Interministerielle de Lutte Contre les Drogues et les Conduites Addictives InterministA(C)rielle de Lutte Contre les Drogues et les Conduites Addictives,Mission Interministerielle de Lutte Contre les Drogues et les Conduites Addictives InterministA(C)rielle de Lutte Contre les Drogues et les Conduites Addictives,This work was supported by the Mission Interministerielle de Lutte Contre les Drogues et les Conduites Addictives InterministA (c) rielle de Lutte Contre les Drogues et les Conduites Addictives.,,42,0,0,1,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

To combat online health misinformation, numerous studies have been conducted to taxonomize health misinformation or examine debunking strategies for various types of health misinformation. However, one of the root causes - strategies in such misinformation that may persuade the readers - is rarely studied. This systematic review aimed to fill this gap. We searched Web of Science, Scopus, PsycINFO, and Communication and Mass Media Complete for studies published between 2011 and 2021 on 29 May 2021. Peer-reviewed studies that discussed persuasive strategies in online misinformation messages were included. Of 1,700 articles identified, 58 were eligible and 258 persuasive strategies were extracted. Following the affinity diagraming process, 225 persuasive strategies in online health misinformation were categorized into 12 thematic groups, including: fabricating narrative with details, using anecdotes and personal experience as evidence, distrusting government or pharmaceutical companies, politicizing health issues, highlighting uncertainty and risk, inappropriate use of scientific evidence, rhetorical tricks, biased reasoning to make a conclusion, emotional appeals, distinctive linguistic features, and establishing legitimacy. Possible antecedents for why and how these persuasive strategies in online health misinformation may influence individuals were discussed. The findings suggest that media literacy education is essential for the public to combat health misinformation.","[Peng, Wei] Michigan State Univ, Dept Media & Informat, 404 Wilson Rd, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Lim, Sue; Meng, Jingbo] Michigan State Univ, Dept Commun, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Michigan State University; Michigan State University,"Peng, W (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Media & Informat, 404 Wilson Rd, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",pengwei@msu.edu,,"Peng, Wei/0000-0003-1576-4532",,,,,102,1,1,36,36,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Based on the case study of Didi Chuxing, China's ride-hailing giant, this article introduces some additional complexities into the dominant storyline by bringing two managerial elements to the fore, namely, labor intermediaries and communication technologies. Although both have long been integral to the control of flexible labor forces in the post-Fordist era, they remain underexplored in the context of the on-demand economy. I argue that labor intermediaries emerge as quick solutions to the indeterminacy of labor mobility power, a critical problem inherent in the just-in-time labor strategies that challenge on-demand platform companies. Communication technologies are crucial for the functioning of this mediated relationship, formulating a virtual space where daily managerial practices take place. Ultimately, I stress that, while the labor process of on-demand platforms represents a shift towards fluid workspace, it does not mean the elimination of the organization-based control that usually occurs in a physical and formal workspace. This case study urges scholars to understand labor control of on-demand platforms as a regime of hybridity that features both continuity and renewal of the various forms of managerial strategies common to flexible production.","[Li, Angela Ke] Natl Univ Singapore, New Media & Commun, Singapore, Singapore",National University of Singapore,"Li, AK (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, New Media & Commun, Singapore, Singapore.",cnmlk@nus.edu.sg,,"Li, Ke/0000-0001-8141-769X",Chiang Ching-Kuo Foundation for International Scholarly Exchange [DD039-A-18],Chiang Ching-Kuo Foundation for International Scholarly Exchange,This work was supported by Chiang Ching-Kuo Foundation for International Scholarly Exchange [Grant Number DD039-A-18].,,48,6,6,17,44,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Search engines are central in information seeking during elections, and have important implications for the distribution of information and, by extension, for democratic society. Using a method involving surveys, qualitative coding, and quantitative analysis of search terms and search results, we show that the sources of information that are returned by Google for both liberal and conservative search terms are strongly correlated. We collected search terms from people with different ideological positions about Senate candidates in the 2018 midterm election from the two main parties in the U.S., in three large and politically distinct states: California, Ohio, and Texas. We then used those search terms to scrape web results and analyze them. Our analysis shows that, in terms of the differences arising from individual search term choices, Google results exhibit a mainstreaming effect that partially neutralizes differentiation of search behaviors, by providing a set of common results, even to dissimilar searches. Based on this analysis, this article offers two main contributions: first, in the development of a method for determining group-level differences based on search input bias; and second, in demonstrating how search engines respond to diverse information seeking behavior and whether that may have implications for public discourse.","[Trielli, Daniel] Northwestern Univ, Sch Commun, Media Technol & Soc Program, Evanston, IL USA; [Diakopoulos, Nicholas] Northwestern Univ, Sch Commun, Evanston, IL USA",Northwestern University; Northwestern University,"Trielli, D (corresponding author), Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",dtrielli@u.northwestern.edu,"Trielli, Daniel/AAA-1023-2021","Trielli, Daniel/0000-0001-6544-1083; Diakopoulos, Nicholas/0000-0001-5005-6123",National Science Foundation [IIS-1717330],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),This work was supported by National Science Foundation [IIS-1717330].,,55,7,7,2,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

In its open and private-based dimension, the Internet is possibly the twenty-first century's epitome of the liberal international order in its global spatial dimension. Therefore, many see deep normative challenges deriving from the rise of powerful, non-liberal actors such as China. In particular, China and Chinese stakeholders are often portrayed as supporters and promoters of a multilateral Internet governance model based on digital sovereignty aimed at completely replacing the existing multistakeholder, private-based model. Academic views on this topic have become less dichotomous throughout the years, especially as China's position on it has become more nuanced. However, this academic and policy debate is still open. This article analyses Chinese stakeholder actions in the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), the key venue for Internet standard-making. Through network analysis, this article maps the engagement of Chinese stakeholders in selected working groups of the IETF over time. Through expert interviews, this article interprets the drivers, evolution, and impact of such engagement. This research yields two main findings: first, it shows that the Chinese government does not have full control of its domestic private actors, among which there is both collaboration and conflict. Second, it concludes that Chinese stakeholders have increasingly accepted the existing functioning of IETF standard-making as they grew influential within it.","[Nanni, Riccardo] Univ Bologna, Dept Polit & Social Sci, Alma Mater Studiorum, Str Maggiore 45, I-40125 Bologna, BO, Italy",University of Bologna,"Nanni, R (corresponding author), Univ Bologna, Dept Polit & Social Sci, Alma Mater Studiorum, Str Maggiore 45, I-40125 Bologna, BO, Italy.",riccardo.nanni9@unibo.it,,"NANNI, RICCARDO/0000-0002-2773-4093",University of Bologna,University of Bologna,The author's work is solely funded by his PhD scholarship at the University of Bologna.,,56,0,0,7,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

This paper relies on both qualitative and quantitative data from an audience survey, supplemented by thematic analysis to explore these themes. We show how the alternative media model of Facebook Watch and the series itself act as rebellions against institutionalized narratives that perpetuate stereotypes against people of color.

However, in limiting the role of brokering to creating horizontal connections among decentralized actors, previous research is missing an account of grassroots movements that were able to make vertical connections with the power structures and grow to have a significant political impact. By comparing two cases of feminist networked social movements from South Korea, I examine brokerage and conditions that enabled brokerage through the lens of leadership. I argue that brokerage is a crucial dimension of movement leadership and propose the concept of meso-level leadership to elaborate how some grassroots leaders could facilitate grassroots representation in mainstream legislative agenda-setting by forming relationships with actors across a broad organizational and institutional spectrum.","[Lee, Yena] Northwestern Univ, Media Technol & Soc, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Northwestern University,"Lee, Y (corresponding author), Frances Searle Bldg,2240 Campus Dr, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",yenalee2024@u.northwestern.edu,"Lee, Yena/GON-8167-2022","Lee, Yena/0000-0001-7700-5756",,,,,33,0,0,1,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Drawing from face-negotiation theory, we recast the model in terms of face concern. Results of a survey of 715 participants indicated that mutual-face concern served as a particularly potent predictor of channel preferences. Channel net benefits mediated the association between the IMM predictors (i.e., face concern and valence) and likelihood of channel use, with communication competence serving as a weak moderator of several IMM predictors (specifically, other-face concern, mutual-face concern, and valence). These results highlight the importance of mutual-face concern in evaluating channel options, and also suggest that channel choice may have more to do with the avoidance of the risk of synchronous communication than a draw to the control of mediated channels.","[Ledbetter, Andrew M.; Herbert, Corley B.] Texas Christian Univ, Commun Studies, TCU Box 298045, Ft Worth, TX 76129 USA",Texas Christian University,"Ledbetter, AM (corresponding author), Texas Christian Univ, Commun Studies, TCU Box 298045, Ft Worth, TX 76129 USA.",a.ledbetter@tcu.edu,,,,,,,38,1,1,4,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

According to this principle, sovereignty depends on more than supra-national alliances or international legal instruments, military might or trade: it depends on locally owned, controlled and operated innovation ecosystems, able to increase states' technical and economic independence and autonomy. Presently, digital sovereignty is understood primarily as a legal concept and a set of political discourses. As a consequence, it is predominantly analyzed by political science, international relations and international law. However, the study of digital sovereignty as a set of infrastructures and socio-material practices has been comparatively neglected. This article explores how the concept of digital sovereignty can be studied via the infrastructure-embedded 'situated practices' of various political and economic projects which aim to establish autonomous digital infrastructures in a hyperconnected world.

Second, that this phase is best understood by examining the relationality between mobile permissions and embedded, third party services known as SDKs (software development kits). Our innovative method seeks to cultivate greater technical fluency for humanities and social science researchers and to offer non-experts greater agency over the myriad ways in which datafication increasingly subsumes our everyday lives. We proceed by (i) a review of existing technical and social scientific literatures; (ii) introducing the platform and resources we created, which holds the permissions and SDKs of over 7000 applications; and (iii) presenting preliminary findings from workshops held at 2019 OrgCon Digital Rights conference with Berlin based non-profit organisation, Tactical Tech.

This article examines the interfaces that Facebook uses to present its audience to three different user groups (ordinary Facebook members, publishers, and finally advertisers) using a social semiotic analytical framework to analyse visuals, interactive elements and desired user paths. The interface displayed to ordinary users, the Facebook Friends page, uses a visual language with roots in the college yearbook, showing rows of faces with minimal available interactivity. This interface preserves the humanity of the audience, suggesting egalitarian social structures and timeless space outside Facebook's ordinary flow. The interfaces displayed to institutional users, Page Insights and Audience Insights, for publishers and advertisers respectively, are quite different, characterised by a multiplicity of charts and high interactivity, with a clear path for the user that ends in 'boosting' your page or 'buying' your audience. The Audience Insights pages for advertisers feature advanced interactive tools which use the conventions of experimental science. These two interfaces do significant rhetorical work, dehumanising and abstracting audiences into data quantities which can be packaged as products, and encouraging publishers to focus on the production of data measuring engagement. Both the promotion of the value of data and the elision of audience work and surveillance, graphically represented in the different interfaces, help platform businesses like Facebook strategically, by increasing the value of their data and by suppressing audience concerns about surveillance.","[Van Couvering, Elizabeth] Karlstad Univ, Dept Geog Media & Commun, Univ Gatan 2, S-65188 Karlstad, Sweden",Karlstad University,"Van Couvering, E (corresponding author), Karlstad Univ, Dept Geog Media & Commun, Univ Gatan 2, S-65188 Karlstad, Sweden.",elizabeth.van-couvering@kau.se,"Van Couvering, Elizabeth/AAH-1185-2020","Van Couvering, Elizabeth/0000-0003-1430-4964",Anne-Marie and Gustaf Ander Foundation for Media Research: [Algorithms and Media Organisations],Anne-Marie and Gustaf Ander Foundation for Media Research: [Algorithms and Media Organisations],This work was supported by Anne-Marie and Gustaf Ander Foundation for Media Research: [Algorithms and Media Organisations].,,56,0,0,3,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Results revealed that narrative fear appeal messages are effective in promoting health experts to correct online health misinformation for the public. Message threat can arouse the emotion of fear through the identification with the narrative character. Moreover, message efficacy plays a moderating role between fear and health misinformation correction. Theoretical implications for EPPM development and practical message strategies for motivating health experts to correction misinformation are discussed.","[Chen, Liang; Tang, Hongjie] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Journalism & Commun, Beijing, Peoples R China",Tsinghua University,"Tang, HJ (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Sch Journalism & Commun, Beijing, Peoples R China.",thj22@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn,,"Chen, Liang/0000-0003-0968-2936",National Office for Philosophy and Social Sciences Fund [19CXW033],National Office for Philosophy and Social Sciences Fund,This work was supported by the National Office for Philosophy and Social Sciences Fund [19CXW033].,,74,0,0,15,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Taken by the Uber as an instrument to measure and regulate market conditions, SP mediates drivers' pragmatic and affective daily practices, materialising a asymmetrical power relation embedded into a neoliberal governmentality. The study explores 25 videos produced and shared by five consolidated Brazilian ubertubers, focusing on how this specific kind of digital influencer systematises and perform collective knowledge on how to increase earnings with surge pricing. The metaphors, hypotheses, and theories, the ubertuber's tactics to deal with SP's instability and with the risks of working on peripheral areas, and the efforts to investigate the logics of a 'new surge' are the main issues approached in the case study. In the conclusions, we discuss how ubertubers' ambivalent relations with surge pricing reveal their wider attempts to navigate neoliberal governmentality and precarious conditions.","[Guerra, Abel] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Media & Commun, London, England; [d'Andrea, Carlos] Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Commun Studies, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais,"Guerra, A (corresponding author), Fawcett House,Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",a.goncalves-guerra@lse.ac.uk; carlosdandrea@ufmg.br,,"d'Andrea, Carlos/0000-0001-7328-6714",Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq/Brasil) [313032/2021-1]; CNPq/Brasil Masters Studentship; London Arts and Humanities Partnership (LAHP/AHRC/UK) Doctoral Studentship,Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq/Brasil)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); CNPq/Brasil Masters Studentship; London Arts and Humanities Partnership (LAHP/AHRC/UK) Doctoral Studentship,This work was supported by Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq/Brasil) -BolsaProdutividade 313032/2021-1; A CNPq/Brasil Masters Studentship; and a London Arts and Humanities Partnership (LAHP/AHRC/UK) Doctoral Studentship.,,47,0,0,6,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Furthermore, Internet skills moderate the relationship between online social engagement and social capital.

This article demonstrates the growing centrality of mobile network operators in managing global health crises through a case study of South Korea's epidemic governance. In South Korea, KT, one of the country's three telecommunications companies, has been actively developing and investing in health surveillance platforms since 2015, promoting that its big-data-based surveillance and ICT infrastructures may prevent the spread of infectious diseases. Conducting a situational analysis of archival materials, I document the process through which such mobile network operators emerge as essential producers of the data infrastructures that shape the understanding and management of public health emergencies. The article also addresses the sociocultural implications of such private technology corporations' capturing of emergency power. In the end, I argue that Korea's public health surveillance systems are increasingly constructed within the capitalist logic of the telecom industry, mainly via 'platformization' - a shift that offers telecom firms to transform from network to platform operators by extracting and aggregating subscribers' data. The case analyzed here demonstrates how granting such extraordinary authority to ICT companies during national emergencies becomes routinized, and even instrumentalized for economic purposes.","[Kim, Youngrim] Univ Michigan, Dept Commun & Media, 5370 North Quad,105 S State St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Kim, Y (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Commun & Media, 5370 North Quad,105 S State St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",youngrim@umich.edu,,"KIM, Youngrim/0000-0001-7771-2872",,,,,52,7,7,2,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Largely missing in these discourses, however, are the potential costs of datafication for pupils' and teachers' agency and the meaning of education itself. This article explores the general discursive framing by which these surveillant practices in education have come to seem natural. Through a study of commercial suppliers of educational platforms, we show how the prevailing vision of datafication in their discourses categorises software systems, not teachers, as central to education, reimagining space, time, and agency within educational processes around the organisation of data systems and the demands of commercial data production. Not only does this legitimate the new connective environment of dataveillance (that is, surveillance through data processing), but it also naturalises a widernormativeenvironment in which teachers and students are assigned new roles and responsibilities. In the process, the panoptic possibilities of ubiquitous commercial access to personal educational data are presented as part of a virtuous circle of knowledge production and even training for good citizenship. This broader rethinking of educationthroughsurveillance must itself be critiqued.","[Yu, Jun; Couldry, Nick] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Media & Commun, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Yu, J (corresponding author), London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Media & Commun, London WC2A 2AE, England.",j.yu20@lse.ac.uk,,"Yu, Jun/0000-0001-6178-3764",John Templeton Foundation; University of Chicago,John Templeton Foundation; University of Chicago(University of Chicago),This work was supported by John Templeton Foundation; University of Chicago.,,85,6,6,4,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

However, the actual trend in the 21st century has been the opposite. Knowledge spillovers have fuelled urbanisation and pulled job-seekers into large cities, increasing the gap with rural areas. We argue that new assemblages of technologies and social practices, so-called 'online labour platforms', have recently started to counter this trend. By providing effective formal and informal mechanisms of enforcing cooperation, these platforms for project-based remote knowledge work enable users to hire and find work across distance. In analysing data from a leading online labour platform in more than 3000 urban and rural counties in the United States, we find that rural workers made disproportionate use of the online labour market. Rural counties also supplied, on average, higher-skilled online work than urban areas did. However, many of the most remote regions of the country did not participate in the online labour market at all. Our findings highlight the potentials and limitations of such platforms for regional economic development.

From the opening scene of the first episode, viewers are positioned to see this series as one that is not afraid to represent explicitly the details of a range of sexual experiences. The series' frank depiction of sexual relationships between characters, and its exploration of characters' hopes, fears, and choices regarding ways to express their sexual desire is, arguably, ground-breaking. This paper focuses upon the ways in which the series represents young people as producers and consumers of pornographic/erotic narratives, harnessing the communication options within their social settings to develop understandings of, and share, information that is often structured as 'inappropriate' for under-18 year-olds. Sex Education sits at the intersection of information (seeking), communication, and society, as young people explore issues of crucial interest and importance to them, which have been all but ignored in most of their school curriculum offerings. Challenging a dominant social perception of sexually-explicit materials as harmful to young people, and suggesting instead that such materials may be beneficial, the series demonstrates how young people may come together to learn about themselves and each other, even as they confront the double standards of a hypersexualised society that offers no legitimate speaking position to under-18s. In this environment, with adults absent from authentic discussion, young people co-construct their future adult selves through producing, consuming, and discussing sexual content (and activities) in conversation with other young people.","[Dudek, Debra; Woodley, Giselle; Green, Lelia] Edith Cowan Univ, Sch Arts & Humanities, Mt Lawley, Australia",Edith Cowan University,"Dudek, D (corresponding author), Edith Cowan Univ, Sch Arts & Humanities, Mt Lawley, Australia.",d.dudek@ecu.edu.au; g.woodley@ecu.edu.au; l.green@ecu.edu.au,,"Dudek, Debra/0000-0003-2882-8830; Green, Lelia/0000-0003-4587-4679; , Giselle/0000-0002-7521-5001",Australian Government through the Australian Research Council [DP190102435],Australian Government through the Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),This research was supported by the Australian Government through the Australian Research Council's Discovery Projects funding scheme (project DP190102435).

Even though extant literature has provided theoretical arguments for a discursive affinity between false or deceptive information and uncivil speech, we lack empirical evidence on whether and how false information and incivility converge. Against this backdrop, we rely on an extensive content analysis of fact-checked statements in the US (N = 894) to assess to what extent and how different forms of incivility are present in different degrees of false information. Our main findings illustrate that partisan attacks, negativity, and hate speech are most likely to occur in false information that deviates furthest from reality. These findings help us to dissect different degrees of untruthfulness based on their content features: Disinformation (goal-directed deception) may be distinguished from misinformation (unintentionally misleading content) based on the centrality of hostility, partisan attacks, and hate speech in the former.","[Hameleers, Michael; Vliegenthart, Rens] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Commun Res, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [van der Meer, Toni] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Commun Res, Dept Corp Commun, Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam; University of Amsterdam,"Hameleers, M (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Commun Res, Amsterdam, Netherlands.;Hameleers, M (corresponding author), Nieuwe Achtergracht 166, NL-1018 WV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",m.hameleers@uva.nl; G.L.A.vandermeer@uva.nl; r.vliegenthart@uva.nl,,,Facebook's Content Policy Research Initiative,Facebook's Content Policy Research Initiative(Facebook Inc),This project was supported by a gift from Facebook's Content Policy Research Initiative.,,30,10,10,4,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

In the United States, the military has rigorously limited journalists' access to military bases, operations, and personnel, but the logics invoked by the government actors who decide whether journalists should be allowed, for the sake of a story, to see what happens on military bases often remain unknown. Drawing on archival research, I introduce what I call anticipatory witnessing, the use of analytical techniques to identify a priori certain people, such as media practitioners, whom state actors foresee will draw on specific elements of professionalism, credentialism, and objectivity in conveying what they have seen to their audiences. The notion of anticipatory witnessing encompasses a form of organizational vetting that is attuned to the specific social, cultural, political, and legal dimensions of those who see and subsequently speak. To engage in anticipatory witnessing is therefore to attempt to limit not just what is seen but who sees it. By analyzing practices adopted by military servicemembers at Guantanamo Bay, I demonstrate the ways in which cross-institutional communications preceding journalists' arrival reveal elements of anticipatory witnessing, including efforts to imagine how specific rhetoric, technologies, modes of address, and partnerships might damage the reputation of the US security state. Anticipatory witnessing thus considers the logics invoked and constellations of stakeholders responsible for limiting access to tightly controlled spaces, such as military bases.","[McCammon, Muira] Univ Penn, Annenberg Sch Commun, 3620 Walnut St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania,"McCammon, M (corresponding author), Univ Penn, Annenberg Sch Commun, 3620 Walnut St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",muira.mccammon@asc.upenn.edu,,,,,,,40,1,1,2,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Using thematic analysis, this study found that responses were characterised by disbelief. Posters questioned the type and nature of evidence that had been provided, they questioned whether these problems resulted from sexism and they questioned the feminist agenda behind the blogs. While voices expressing disbelief were dominant, there were counter-voices attempting to critique the scepticism by advocating for the importance of the lived experience women and girls.

Although traditionally associated with harassment, blocklists are increasingly engaged to create individualised environments that align with users' personal convictions and exclude apparent transgressors. This study uses a pro-choice blocklist (Repeal Shield) created during the 2018 Irish abortion referendum campaign to explore how users interpret these altered boundaries and blocklists' influence on the Twitter landscape. A metaphor analysis of more than 2,000 tweets discussing the blocklist highlights the dominant concepts in how users visualise Twitter as both a personal space and a battlefield, in which mental health is a key factor. By drawing on discussions of spatiality, agency, gender and online interactions, we can see how these blocking affordances allow users to exist in spaces in which they construct their own parameters to feel safer, raising questions about how harm, health and risk are understood. The article explores how users make sense of conflicting images like 'safe spaces' or 'echo chambers', highlighting the apparent policing role held by blocklists. Users are negotiating the type of civic space in which they want to exist as norms of engagement versus avoidance collide; although digital spaces have always accommodated fragmented interests, the technological affordances of blocklists provide more rigid boundaries, highlighting how the evolving architecture of social media allows users to redefine the parameters of their own online spaces.","[Wheatley, Dawn] Dublin City Univ, Sch Commun, Dublin, Ireland; [Vatnoey, Eirik] Univ Oslo, Dept Linguist & Scandinavian Studies, Oslo, Norway",Dublin City University; University of Oslo,"Wheatley, D (corresponding author), Dublin City Univ, Sch Commun, Dublin, Ireland.",dawn.wheatley@dcu.ie,,"Wheatley, Dawn/0000-0002-8751-4535",,,,,46,3,3,3,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Danlan endeavors to form a symbiosis with the government to pursue its survival and development, yet eventually risks alienating from the gay community and colluding with the state in governing homosexuality.

In most countries, however, their uptake has been too low to realize their full potential. This study contributes to the understanding of CTA adoption by investigating the influence of public perceptions on adoption and the role of media in forming these perceptions in Singapore and Switzerland. In a comparative approach, online surveys in both countries (Singapore: N = 998; Switzerland: N = 1,022) and multigroup structural equation modeling reveal national differences. First, attention to media was associated more strongly with app-related perceptions in Singapore than in Switzerland, with news media attention correlating positively with favorable perceptions in both countries (i.e., perceived usefulness of the CTA, perceived social norms of adoption) and social media attention correlating negatively with these perceptions in Singapore. Second, regarding the influence of these perceptions on CTA adoption, perceived usefulness was associated with CTA adoption in Switzerland but not in Singapore; conversely, perceived social norms were more important in Singapore than in Switzerland. These results suggest that the communicative formation of public perceptions and their behavioral relevance are contingent on media systems (authoritarian vs. democratic media system) and cultural values (collectivism vs. individualism), highlighting the theoretical value of a country-comparative approach and the practical need for a culturally sensitive implementation of health technologies.","[Geber, Sarah] Univ Zurich, Dept Commun & Media Res, Andreasstr 15, CH-8050 Zurich, Switzerland; [Ho, Shirley S.] Nanyang Technol Univ, Wee Kim Wee Sch Commun & Informat, Singapore, Singapore",University of Zurich; Nanyang Technological University & National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore; Nanyang Technological University,"Geber, S (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Dept Commun & Media Res, Andreasstr 15, CH-8050 Zurich, Switzerland.",s.geber@ikmz.uzh.ch,,"Ho, Shirley/0000-0003-1079-103X; Geber, Sarah/0000-0002-0541-9148",Leading House for the Bilateral Science and Technology Cooperation Programme with Asia [COV_08_062020]; Digital Society Initiative of the University of Zurich; ETH Zurich,Leading House for the Bilateral Science and Technology Cooperation Programme with Asia; Digital Society Initiative of the University of Zurich; ETH Zurich(ETH Zurich),"This work was supported by the ETH Zurich, Leading House for the Bilateral Science and Technology Cooperation Programme with Asia [COV_08_062020] and the Digital Society Initiative of the University of Zurich.",,69,1,1,3,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Results point to a majority for moderate post-pandemic HCA use, while almost four out of ten users support expansive HCA use and the voice for restricted or terminated use is tiny.

Our findings reveal that the maternal is strategically invoked in anti-vaccine content by appealing to three interrelated ideal types: the protective mother; the intuitive mother and the doting mother. These portrayals of the maternal are used to encourage vaccine refusal by presenting hegemonic ideals of the 'good mother' as one who is natural, holistic and authentic; depicting anti-vaccination as a feminine ideal to which mothers ought to aspire. Authenticity is framed here as a form of embodied expertise, uncorrupted by culture, politics and the medical establishment.

It juxtaposes the rural migrant workers' encouraged engagement with digital dating with interview accounts which reveal that digital dating presents a large sum of obstacles to the fulfilment of sexual and romantic desire. Our research shows that these obstacles (both 'virtual' and 'real') are highly gendered, which is partly related to a cultural shift towards materialism in the Chinese society. Specifically, rural migrant men have described themselves as being harshly excluded or exploited on the dating scene, whereas rural migrant women have reported that they have unwittingly dated men with deceptive profiles or developed romantic relationships that were dashed by economic turmoil. Hence, the study empirically extends the literature on digital dating beyond its traditional focus on Western contexts. It also clearly demonstrates that, while digital dating ignites a sense of possibility and desire, particularly among individuals of lower socioeconomic status, it fails to support these users in tackling the structural inequalities obstructing realization of their desire.","[Liu, Tingting; Wang, Yinan; Lin, Zhongxuan] Jinan Univ, Sch Journalism & Commun, Guangzhou, Peoples R China",Jinan University,"Lin, ZX (corresponding author), 601 Huangpu West Ave, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",lzhongx55@sina.com,"liu, ting/GZM-3326-2022",,,,,,72,10,10,12,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

While much of the public discourse surrounding platforms evolves at a policy level between think tanks, journalists, academics and political actors, little attention is paid to how people think about regulation of and by platforms. Through a representative survey study of US internet users (N = 1,022), we explore antecedents of support for social media content moderation by platforms, as well as for regulation of social media platforms by the government. We connect these findings to presumed effects on self (PME1) and others (PME3), concepts that lie at the core of third-person effect (TPE) and influence of presumed influence (IPI) scholarship. We identify third-person perceptions for social media content: Perceived negative effects are stronger for others than for oneself. A first-person perception operates on the platform level: The beneficial effects of social media platforms are perceived to be stronger for the self than for society. At the behavioral level, we identify age, education, opposition to censorship, and perceived negative effects of social media content on others (PME3) as significant predictors of support for content moderation. Concerning support for regulation of platforms by the government, we find significant effects of opposition to censorship, perceived intentional censorship, frequency of social media use, and trust in platforms.

For example, videos from individualistic countries included significantly more instances of trolling behaviors than those from collectivistic countries. We found that in global trolling collective intelligence patterns of replication, innovation, and customization were prominent along with the impact or omission of the original idea. While most of these patterns have been documented by other scholars, we identified the additional pattern of omission that in an extreme case led to a minimalist approach, excluding most of the original idea. This study is unique and timely in that it focuses on global trolling and analyzes internet videos as a medium of trolling.","[Fichman, Pnina] Indiana Univ, Rob Kling Ctr Social Informat, Luddy Sch Informat Comp & Engn, Bloomington, IN USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Fichman, P (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Luddy Hall 2114,700 N Woodlawn Ave, Bloomington, IN 47408 USA.",fichman@indiana.edu,,"FICHMAN, Pnina/0000-0002-9440-7615",,,,,37,1,1,8,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

This article critically examines how the participation of Chinese women digital gamers has taken on a distinctive shape in the context of newly emerging local online games that serve as an extension of the market mechanism. We examine the players' experience of two games: namely, a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game,King of Glory(wangzhe rongyao), and an otome love simulation game,Evol LoveR(lian yu zhizuoren). Results of 31 in-depth qualitative interviews with Chinese women gamers show that Chinese women's gaming experience has been profoundly shaped by both changes and continuities in the norms governing Chinese women's participation in play, romance and sex. We conclude that Chinese MOBA and otome games are not isolated new media products, but actually part and parcel of a broader digital media economy which provides audiences and players with information and cues that reinforce the dominant view that women and men have fundamentally different characteristics.","[Liu, Tingting] Jinan Univ, Sch Journalism & Commun, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Lai, Zishan] Univ Sydney, Media & Commun, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",Jinan University; University of Sydney,"Lai, ZS (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Media & Commun, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",laizishan1@gmail.com,"liu, ting/GZM-3326-2022","Lai, Zishan/0000-0001-9577-5834",,,,,89,9,9,26,78,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

It introduces the notion of 'embedded reproduction': the relationship between embeddedness, the degree to which non-economic institutions and their social environment constrain socioeconomic activity, and social reproduction, or the activities that nurture, maintain, and regenerate the workforce. The analysis of 38 interviews with platform workers suggests they are situated in a highly disembedded market due to the lack of regulations on the data production process, giving free rein to platforms to set rules to their detriment. This article explores how this disembeddedness shapes social reproduction by studying three forms of collective social support received by workers: from family members, neighbors and local communities, and online groups. The support of these networks is primarily local, depends on high levels of trust, and is gendered. These findings suggest that platform data work is unsustainable from an embedded reproductive perspective since platform intermediation leads workers and local communities to carry out the social and economic risks associated with this form of gig work. This research invites a dialogue between the embeddedness framework with social reproduction as well as a consideration of the importance of nature and natural resources in the study of social environments.","[Posada, Julian] Univ Toronto, Fac Informat, Toronto, ON, Canada",University of Toronto,"Posada, J (corresponding author), Massey Coll, 4 Devonshire Pl, Toronto, ON M5S 2E1, Canada.",julian.posada@mail.utoronto.ca,,"Posada, Julian/0000-0002-3285-6503",International Development Research Centre; Schwartz Reisman Institute,International Development Research Centre; Schwartz Reisman Institute,This work was supported by International Development Research Centre [Doctoral Research Award] and Schwartz Reisman Institute [Graduate Fellowship].,,60,0,0,5,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Recent successes of populist parties and politicians, especially in Europe and in the US, have given rise to extensive debates in the academic literature and beyond. Yet the link between populism and climate change scepticism (henceforth 'scepticism'), has so far received little attention. This paper examines the link between scepticism and populism by means of a unique dataset: a survey and detailed web browsing histories of participants from France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the US, and the UK. The web tracking data includes more than 150 million website visits over a period of three months and the survey contains questions about political attitudes and attitudes towards climate change. We analyse the 8893 websites which contained 'climate change' and its cognates in the URLs and link these website visits and the content of these websites to the political attitudes and climate change orientation of those who visited them. The contribution is both methodological (linking surveys and web tracking data, including cross-country comparison) and substantive (uncovering links between populists, their climate change orientations, and the content of related websites they visited). Our analysis demonstrates the value of computational methods in political communication research and provides insights into the link between populists and climate change scepticism.","[Yan, Pu; Schroeder, Ralph] Univ Oxford, Oxford Internet Inst, Oxford, England; [Stier, Sebastian] GESIS Leibniz Inst Social Sci, Dept Computat Social Sci, Cologne, Germany",University of Oxford; Leibniz Institut fur Sozialwissenschaften (GESIS),"Schroeder, R (corresponding author), 1 St Giles, Oxford OX1 3JS, England.",ralph.schroeder@oii.ox.ac.uk,"Stier, Sebastian/AAH-4394-2019","Stier, Sebastian/0000-0002-1217-5778; Yan, Pu/0000-0003-2589-5050",Volkswagen Foundation [94758],Volkswagen Foundation(Volkswagen),This work was supported by Volkswagen Foundation Grant No. 94758.,,32,9,9,7,30,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

These platforms nevertheless have the potential to facilitate informal learning about the color blind racism through which whites rationalize the inequalities and injustices experienced by People of Color (PoC). This paper adds to the emergent literature in this area by exploring a high-profile Twitterstorm in February 2018 following a tweet from Cambridge University Professor Mary Beard about the sexual misconduct of Oxfam aid workers in Haiti. Academics like Dr Priya Gopal faced much criticism for suggesting the tweet was evidence of the white fragility and privilege to which they were frequently subjected. A qualitative content analysis of 1718 unique tweets containing 'Mary Beard', posted between 16 and 20 February 2018, was conducted to assess whether there was much evidence of agonistic debate between critics and supporters of Beard about whiteness. Results indicate that there were twice as many tweets criticizing Beard for her performative white privilege and frailty than those defending her. While the framing of the Twitterstorm was generally agonistic, there was little evidence of informal learning, with PoC conspicuously under-represented. Indeed, the burden of talking about racism and whiteness fell on the few PoC in the corpus, in much the same way as the 'pre-social media' era.","[Ashwell, Ceri] Univ Sheffield, Affiliated Informat Sch, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Reilly, Paul] Univ Glasgow, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland",University of Sheffield; University of Glasgow,"Reilly, P (corresponding author), Univ Glasgow, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland.",Paul.Reilly@glasgow.ac.uk,"Reilly, Paul J/P-3803-2016","Reilly, Paul J/0000-0002-6890-778X; Ashwell, Ceri/0000-0002-2806-9611",University of Sheffield,University of Sheffield,This work was supported by University of Sheffield.,,64,0,0,1,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

At stake, we argue, is children's agency. Yet free play is under threat in both digital and nondigital contexts. Recognising that different configurations of the contexts in which play occurs affect whether and how children can play on their own terms, this article draws on the long tradition of research on child-led or free play in natural or nondigital contexts to explore children's play in digital contexts. Combining qualitative and quantitative research methods, we examine the qualities of children's play and the factors that shape it so as to reimagine, together with children, parents and professionals working with children, a digital environment that could better serve children's best interests. The findings show that the qualities of children's play are strikingly similar in digital and nondigital contexts but that children find certain social-technical configurations restrictive of their agency and freedom to develop their identity through play in digital contexts. Based on children's implicit and explicit calls for change, we propose a 'playful by design' approach by which designers and providers of digital products and services could urge those with the powers to redesign digital environments to prioritise digital features that promote children's imaginative, social, open-ended, risk-taking and stimulating play while limiting the risks to children's safety, privacy and self-determination that arise from commercial interests.","[Livingstone, Sonia; Pothong, Kruakae] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Media & Commun, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Livingstone, S (corresponding author), London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Media & Commun, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",s.livingstone@lse.ac.uk,,"Livingstone, Sonia/0000-0002-3248-9862",5Rights Foundation; LEGO,5Rights Foundation; LEGO,This work was funded by 5Rights Foundation and LEGO (in 2020/21).,,57,0,0,6,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Drawing on frequency counts, structural topic modeling, and qualitative content analysis, our data reveal the important role electoral communication plays in framing current events and the extent to which email is an essential node in the right-wing media ecosystem.","[Tripodi, Francesca; Ma, Yuanye] Univ N Carolina, Sch Informat & Lib Sci, 216 Lenoir Dr,CB 3360 100 Manning Hall, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,"Tripodi, F (corresponding author), Univ N Carolina, Sch Informat & Lib Sci, 216 Lenoir Dr,CB 3360 100 Manning Hall, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",ftripodi@email.unc.edu,,,,,,,80,1,1,2,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

On social media direct feedback mechanisms such as retweets or likes signal to politicians which message and tone are popular. Current research suggests that negative language increases the number of retweets a single tweet receives, indicating preferences for negativity in the audience on Twitter. However, it remains unclear whether politicians adapt to the logic of Twitter or simply follow the rules determined by the broader political context, namely the state of their electoral race. We use sentiment analysis to measure the tone used by 342 candidates in 97,909 tweets in their Twitter campaign in the 2018 midterm elections for the US House of Representatives and map the ideological composition of each politician's Twitter network. We show that the feedback candidates receive creates an incentive to use negativity. The size and direction of the tonal incentive is connected to the ideological composition of the candidate's follower network. Unexpectedly, the platform-specific incentive does not affect the tone used by candidates in their Twitter campaigns. Instead we find that the tone is mainly related to characteristics of the electoral race. We show that our findings are not dependent on our sentiment measurement by validating our results using hand coding and machine learning.","[Mueller, Samuel David; Saeltzer, Marius] Univ Mannheim, Polit Sci, A5,6, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany",University of Mannheim,"Mueller, SD (corresponding author), Univ Mannheim, Polit Sci, A5,6, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany.",sammuell@mail.uni-mannheim.de,"Saeltzer, Marius/AAM-8268-2021","Saeltzer, Marius/0000-0002-8604-4666",University of Mannheim's Graduate School of Economic and Social Sciences (GESS),University of Mannheim's Graduate School of Economic and Social Sciences (GESS),This work was supported by the University of Mannheim's Graduate School of Economic and Social Sciences (GESS).,,52,6,6,1,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

The mechanics of an algorithmic model may be hard to comprehend for experts and can be virtually incomprehensible to non-experts. This is of consequence because such black boxing can introduce power asymmetries and may obscure bias. This paper explores the practices through which experts and non-experts determine the credibility of algorithmic models.

Amidst the heightened geopolitical competition between the US and China, the growing power of Chinese infrastructuralized platforms has made them the center of recent geopolitical dynamics. Drawing from an exploratory case study, this paper discusses Alibaba, one of the most prominent Chinese Internet giants, as an infrastructuralized platform, and highlights its geopolitical struggles. Often perceived as an e-commerce company, Alibaba has become 'infrastructuralized': its now-massive digital empire has moved beyond e-commerce, expanding into almost every aspect of China's and global digital economy such as logistics, finance, offline retailing, and cloud computing. This paper traces three highly visible cases in Alibaba's global journey - its failed deal with MoneyGram in 2017, the uneven global journey of Alibaba Cloud, and the construction of the electronic World Trade Platform - to illustrate three key dimensions of the geopolitics of infrastructuralized platforms - namely, the geopolitics of everyday data, the geopolitics of the visibility-invisibility tension, and the geopolitics of modularity. By doing so, it contributes to the following two areas of scholarship. On the one hand, it contributes to the growing literature on 'infrastructures and platforms' by foregrounding the geopolitical dimensions of Chinese infrastructuralized platforms. On the other hand, it adds to the literature on the 'geopolitics of infrastructures' by bringing in a new type of infrastructure, complementing previous discussions on the geopolitics of traditional material infrastructures.","[Shen, Hong] Human Comp Interact Inst, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [He, Yujia] Univ Kentucky, Patterson Sch Diplomacy & Int Commerce, Lexington, KY 40506 USA",University of Kentucky,"Shen, H (corresponding author), Carnegie Mellon Univ, Human Comp Interact Inst, 5000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",hongs@cs.cmu.edu,,,Qatar National Library,Qatar National Library(Qatar National Research Fund (QNRF)),Open Access funding provided by the Qatar National Library.,,81,0,0,9,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

A less explored area, however, is how these divides relate to potential divides in morality. The Habermasian conceptualization of the public sphere prioritizes deliberative reasoning as a way to solve moral conflicts. In contrast, this study argues that divides in reasoning and opinion are associated with divides in morality. To make the argument, this study focuses on the case of public debates over whether social media companies should deplatform Trump and his supporters in the aftermath of the January 6, 2021 Capitol insurrection. Public comments were obtained from a dataset compiled and released by Facebook Oversight Board. First, I used structural topic modeling to identify the reasoning and used the dictionary based on the Moral Foundations Theory to gauge moral foundations in each document. Then, I used statistical analysis to examine whether there was a correlation between specific reasoning and moral foundations. The results show that the pro- and anti-deplatforming camps in the debate are divided not only in reasoning, but also in morality. Supporters of deplatforming argue that it would fulfill tech companies' public responsibility, and protect society at large. These arguments are correlated with the care foundation. In contrast, opponents argue that deplatforming Trump violated freedom of speech. This argument is correlated with the fairness, loyalty, and authority foundations, but not the care foundation. The findings support my argument that divides in reasoning should be analyzed with consideration of morality.","[Luo, Zhifan] York Univ, Inst Res Digital Literacies, Toronto, ON, Canada",York University - Canada,"Luo, ZF (corresponding author), York Univ, Inst Res Digital Literacies, Toronto, ON, Canada.",luozhifan0310@gmail.com,,"Luo, Zhifan/0000-0001-5572-5680",,,,,63,1,1,4,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

The study uses multiple correspondence analysis on a national survey deployed in Sweden (n=3,902). Various place-exposing practices are analyzed in relation to the contemporary Swedish class structure. Results reveal a connection between various forms and volumes of capital and the places that people visit and chose to put on display for online audiences. We are thus able to verify how the socio-technological regime of geomedia, with its new arenas for online exposure, extends deep-seated dynamics of socio-cultural reproduction and even reinforces the classificatory linkages between spatial appropriation and social identity work.","[Lindell, Johan] Uppsala Univ, Dept Informat & Media, Kyrkogardsgatan 10, S-75120 Uppsala, Sweden; [Jansson, Andre] Karlstad Univ, Dept Geog Media & Commun, Karlstad, Sweden; [Fast, Karin] Univ Oslo, Dept Media & Commun, Oslo, Norway",Uppsala University; Karlstad University; University of Oslo,"Lindell, J (corresponding author), Uppsala Univ, Dept Informat & Media, Kyrkogardsgatan 10, S-75120 Uppsala, Sweden.",johan.lindell@im.uu.se,,"Lindell, Johan/0000-0001-6689-0710",Anne-Marie och Gustaf Anders stiftelse for medieforskning,Anne-Marie och Gustaf Anders stiftelse for medieforskning,This work was supported by Anne-Marie och Gustaf Anders stiftelse for medieforskning.,,74,3,3,3,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

The observed patterns of network evolution suggest that the simultaneous migration of these actors to Telegram has allowed them to swiftly recreate their connections and gain prominence in the network thus casting doubt on the effectiveness of deplatforming for curbing the influence of far-right and other extremist actors.","[Urman, Aleksandra] Univ Bern, Inst Commun & Media Studies, Bern, Switzerland; [Katz, Stefan] Bern Univ Appl Sci, Inst Digital Enabling, Bern, Switzerland",University of Bern,"Urman, A (corresponding author), Univ Bern, Inst Commun & Media Studies, Bern, Switzerland.",aleksandra.urman@ikmb.unibe.ch,"Urman, Aleksandra/AAD-2217-2020","Urman, Aleksandra/0000-0003-3332-9294; Katz, Stefan/0000-0002-7828-3835",,,,,56,37,37,8,30,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Using social role theory (Eagly, 1987) and role congruity theory (Diekman & Eagly, 2008) as theoretical frameworks, it is proposed that attitudes and beliefs related to traditional gender roles account for differences in the way that games are played and experienced by women compared to men. World of Warcraft (WoW), one of the most popular, best-selling computer games (Entertainment Software Association, 2016), was chosen to investigate gender roles in gaming. Using controlled observations of actual WoW gameplay, the current study (N = 229 observations) examined the amount of negative feedback player characters received from other online players based on the character's gender and role type. Findings indicated that female characters playing in masculine roles did not receive more negative feedback than comparable male characters in masculine roles, counter to role congruity theory. However, female characters in feminine roles received significantly less negative feedback than female characters in masculine roles. Together, these results suggest that stereotypical gender roles have an impact on gameplay and future research needs to examine the explanatory factors behind this.","[Chappetta, Kelsey C.; Barth, Joan M.] Univ Alabama, Inst Social Sci Res, POB 870216, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA",University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa,"Chappetta, KC (corresponding author), Univ Alabama, Inst Social Sci Res, POB 870216, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA.",kchappetta@crimson.ua.edu,,,,,,,37,0,0,4,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

An e-government website is an essential communication platform that supports government-citizen interaction. The current research examines the relationship between e-government website evaluation and the variables indicative of the usage of e-government services (user satisfaction and intention to use) with basic social perceptions toward the government as the mediators using structural equation modelling. According to the stereotype content model (Fiske, 1993; Fiske et al., 2002), people form an impression of others based on two basic social dimensions (warmth and competence), and different levels of these dimensions determine how one forms attitudes and behaves toward the target. Our analysis confirms that both warmth and competence judgment function as crucial mediators for the relationship between e-government website evaluation and the intention to utilize e-government websites. This suggests that the government agency is not simply viewed as a service provider but also as a social entity that encompasses both warmth and competence from the perspective of citizens. By observing the aspects of website evaluation that are associated with the social dimensions, policymakers can strategically enhance citizens' perception toward the government as well as their relationship with the government for the optimal operation of a country in a long-term perspective.","[Lee, Byung-Kwan] Kwangwoon Univ, Coll Humanities & Social Sci, Dept Ind Psychol, Seoul, South Korea; [Lee, Eun Hee] Univ Nottingham Malaysia, Fac Sci, Sch Psychol, Semenyih, Malaysia; [Lee, Taejun (David)] KDI Sch Publ Policy & Management, 263 Namsejong Ro, Sejong 30149, South Korea",Kwangwoon University; University of Nottingham Malaysia; KDI School of Public Policy & Management,"Lee, T (corresponding author), KDI Sch Publ Policy & Management, 263 Namsejong Ro, Sejong 30149, South Korea.",davidtjlee@kdischool.ac.kr,,"Lee, Eun Hee/0000-0002-3877-0962; Lee, Byung-Kwan/0000-0002-5624-7518",KDI School of Public Policy and Management; Kwangwoon University,KDI School of Public Policy and Management; Kwangwoon University,We are grateful to the KDI School of Public Policy and Management for providing financial support.

This article addresses the question of how networks of Australian health professionals engaged with COVID-19 facts and myths on Twitter between August and October 2020. After reviewing selected literature on COVID-19 misinformation, we present our analytical choices and the methodology we used to constitute datasets of COVID-19 factual and mythical hashtags and of verified Australian health professional accounts (N:377). The article distinguishes between the capacities of 'actor-actants' and 'issue-actants,' and between the adoption of 'field' and 'contested' hashtags during a controversy. We identify categories of Australian health professional Twitter accounts such as GPs, nurses, specialists, public health professionals and researchers, and analyse the patterns of connections between these actor-actants and COVID-19 facts and myths. We find that these categories exhibit clearly distinct behaviour when tweeting or retweeting factual and mythical hashtags. Even though the rate of Australian health professionals' connection with myths in comparison to facts on Twitter is low, hashtags such as #hydroxychloroquine attracted significant engagement. We examine these hashtags' context and find that they were mainly being debunked, though a minority of accounts endorsed them. We analyse these adoption patterns, and critically assess the 'echo chamber effect.' We also consider public health and privacy implications for the dissemination of accurate information, for trust in health professionals during a pandemic, and for combatting misinformation.","[O'Neil, Mathieu; Khan, Irfan; Holland, Kate; Cai, Xiaolan] Univ Canberra, Fac Arts & Design, News & Media Res Ctr, Canberra, ACT, Australia",University of Canberra,"O'Neil, M (corresponding author), Univ Canberra, Fac Arts & Design, News & Media Res Ctr, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",mathieu.oneil@canberra.edu.au,,"Khan, Md Irfanuzzaman/0000-0003-2671-7053; Cai, Xiaolan/0000-0002-1708-7304; Holland, Kate/0000-0003-3873-5769; O'Neil, Mathieu/0000-0002-3537-9036",University of Canberra,University of Canberra,This work was supported by the University of Canberra.,,61,1,1,4,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

This article examines the marketing and design of such products in relation to historical systems of racial, ethnic, moral, and psychological differentiation based on the face, such as physiognomy and eugenics. In particular, it explores user-generated 'Which Are You?' filters and apps such as FaceApp, Fantastic Face, and Gradient, which provide visual forecasting, horoscopes, and beauty and ethnic analysis based primarily on face scans. It argues that affinities of these automated optical tools to racist and discriminatory historical systems of face analysis - especially within the context of the representation or performance of identity on social media - can have important implications for the adoption of more extensive systems of facial detection and recognition. Packaging diagnostic and predictive face analysis in these ways can generate acceptance of, and support for, government and corporate applications of these technologies to identify or categorize individuals and predict their behavior, despite widespread social justice concerns over the design, accuracy, administration, and ethics of such systems.","[Monteiro, Stephen] Concordia Univ, Montreal, PQ, Canada",Concordia University - Canada,"Monteiro, S (corresponding author), Concordia Univ, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",stephen.monteiro@concordia.ca,,,,,,,91,0,0,6,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

This paper inductively explores whether popular music is a source of cultural frames about inequality. We construct an original dataset combining user data from Spotify with lyrics from Genius and employ unsupervised computational text analysis to classify the content of the 3,660 most popular songs across 23 European countries. Drawing on Lizardo's enculturation framework, we analyze lyrics through the lens of public culture and explore their link with individual beliefs as a reflection of personal culture. We find that, in more unequal societies, songs that frame inequalities as a structural issue (lyrics about 'Struggle' or omnipresent 'Risks') are more popular than those adopting a meritocratic frame (songs we describe as 'Bragging Rights' or those telling a 'Rags to Riches' tale). Moreover, we find that the presence in public culture of a certain frame is associated with the expression of frame-consistent individual beliefs about inequality. We conclude by reflecting on the promise of automatic text classification for the study of lyrics, the theorized role of popular music in the study of culture, and by proposing venues for future research.","[Carbone, Luca] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Leuven Sch Mass Commun Res, Fac Social Sci, Parkstr 45, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium; [Mijs, Jonathan] Boston Univ, Dept Sociol, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Mijs, Jonathan] Erasmus Univ, Dept Publ Adm & Sociol, Rotterdam, Netherlands",KU Leuven; Boston University; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Carbone, L (corresponding author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, Leuven Sch Mass Commun Res, Fac Social Sci, Parkstr 45, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.",luca.carbone@kuleuven.be,"Carbone, Luca/AAB-6088-2022","Carbone, Luca/0000-0003-1688-9468; Mijs, Jonathan J.B./0000-0002-7895-0028",,,,,60,1,1,6,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Studies from the Global North have examined children and social media from several perspectives, with discourse now veering towards a rights-based approach to foreground young people's voices in a digital and social media world, something that is missing in countries like India. This paper drew on deep interactions with young people from a large Indian city to gain preliminary insights into social media practices and modes of engagement with particular reference to management of access, privacy, safety, and negotiating challenges or problem solving. Our study suggests that conversations about digital platforms, particularly social media spaces, in relation to children's everyday life practices need to begin early, at the point when children begin interacting with these technologies. Critical digital literacy must recognize the agency of young people, their naturalized interactions with the digital world, as well as the complexities of family and school life that moderate such interactions. These contextual nuances become significant when framing regulatory policies, parental advisories and critical digital literacy and media education programs. This article adds to the slowly growing literature from the Global South that enhances and diversifies our understanding of how the 'born digital' generation lives with/in social media.","[Sarwatay, Devina; Raman, Usha] Univ Hyderabad, Sarojini Naidu Sch Arts & Commun, Dept Commun, Prof CR Rao Rd, Hyderabad 500046, India",University of Hyderabad,"Sarwatay, D (corresponding author), Univ Hyderabad, Sarojini Naidu Sch Arts & Commun, Dept Commun, Prof CR Rao Rd, Hyderabad 500046, India.",devina.sarwatay@gmail.com; usharaman@uohyd.ac.in,"; Sarwatay, Devina/E-7265-2015","Raman, Usha/0000-0002-9023-9853; Sarwatay, Devina/0000-0003-3453-5786",,,,,43,1,1,5,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Through an analysis of the smartphone feature called Apple Memories, the paper seeks to highlight the narratives algorithms tell, how they are constructed, and the potential impacts they may have on everyday life.

An important difference to traditional educational videos is that the instructor is often not a professional educator, but an amateur or peer. Building on work on social learning from models, this paper explores how instructor characteristics such as model-observer similarity, instructor credibility (expertise, trustworthiness, attractiveness), and conversational human voice influence choice and evaluation of a how-to video. A survey (n = 401) among active Internet users was conducted. Most respondents had used YouTube and had watched how-to videos on YouTube. Respondents preferred videos with instructors that they perceived as experts and trustworthy, and who talked in a conversational human voice. Instructors of the same gender as the viewer were also preferred, especially by males. The instructor variables explained variance in perceived usefulness and intention to use how-to videos above and beyond the technical and instructional quality of the video. However, only conversational human voice and same gender of the instructor turned out to be significant predictors of perceived usefulness and intention to use.","[Utz, Sonja; Wolfers, Lara N.] Leibniz Inst Wissensmedien, Social Media, Schleichstr 6, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; [Utz, Sonja] Univ Tubingen, Dept Psychol, Tubingen, Germany",Leibniz Institut fur Wissensmedien; Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen,"Utz, S (corresponding author), Leibniz Inst Wissensmedien, Social Media, Schleichstr 6, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany.",s.utz@iwm-tuebingen.de,"Wolfers, Lara/AAJ-5679-2021; Utz, Sonja/B-7256-2008","Wolfers, Lara/0000-0002-1074-1617; Utz, Sonja/0000-0002-7979-3554",,,,,49,7,7,9,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

The paper addresses an unexplored question about this phenomenon: which characteristics are associated with higher levels of ostensive user engagement with political infographics in social media? We conceptualize ostensive user engagement as the outward-facing metrics afforded by a platform (e.g., like, share, and comment count) that serve both as means for self-presentation and shape the informational environment that others are exposed to. A corpus comprised of all infographics posted on Facebook by the four leading candidates in the 2016 US presidential campaign (N = 252) was coded for cognitive, behavioral, and emotional characteristics. We found that two of the cognitively oriented dimensions enhanced engagement, while behavioral cues (calls to action) were, surprisingly, negatively linked. The inclusion of emotions did not show an overall association; however, a deeper look revealed a candidate-specific effect: anger was associated with greater engagement on Trump's infographics, and similarly, pleasure on Sanders'. In conclusion, we discuss the implications of our findings for understanding the informational environment shaped by engagement with infographics in light of the two seemingly opposing perceptions of internal and external authenticity.","[Amit-Danhi, Eedan R.; Shifman, Limor] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Commun & Journalism, Jerusalem, Israel",Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"Amit-Danhi, ER (corresponding author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Commun, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel.",eedan.amit-danhi@mail.huji.ac.il,,"Amit-Danhi, Eedan R./0000-0002-7029-218X",Smart Family Institute of Communications at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem,Smart Family Institute of Communications at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem,This work was supported by The Smart Family Institute of Communications at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.,,54,4,4,1,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Parents' accounts highlight the affective dimensions of their enactments of Facebook for information and support. Situated in the literature on connective and disconnective strategies on Facebook, I argue that the affective forces users experience in relation to Facebook extend beyond what we would traditionally think of as the boundaries of the Facebook user assemblage, with experiences of anxiety and judgment continuing after the choice to disconnect.

One aspect that is missing from efforts to resolve the revolving door effect is how access to and use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) might improve the reentry process. Focus groups with 73 male and female returning citizens in a large Midwestern city examined which types of ICTs parolees use and for what purposes; what the key barriers to access and use are; and which kinds of ICTs parolees need for reentry services. Our findings show that both access and lack of skills are barriers to using ICTs, with many perceived negative effects reported by our participants. As part of our policy recommendations, we stress the importance of including ICT training during and after incarceration.","[Reisdorf, Bianca C.] Univ North Carolina Charlotte, Dept Commun Studies, 9201 Univ City Blvd, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA; [DeCook, Julia] Loyola Univ Chicago, Sch Commun, Advocacy & Social Change, Chicago, IL USA; [Foster, Megan] Univ Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [Cobbina, Jennifer; LaCourse, Ashleigh] Michigan State Univ, Sch Criminal Justice, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Charlotte; Loyola University Chicago; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; Michigan State University,"Reisdorf, BC (corresponding author), Univ North Carolina Charlotte, Dept Commun Studies, 9201 Univ City Blvd, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA.",bianca.reisdorf@uncc.edu,,/0000-0002-2704-1318,Michigan State University,Michigan State University,This work was supported by Michigan State University: [Grant Number S3 Funding (no award number)].,,34,2,2,1,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

We analyze the reach and strategic aims of the '120 decibels' campaign, launched by members of the Austrian Identitarian Movement via social media in early 2018 in an attempt to latch onto the prominence of the MeToo hashtag (#MeToo). We argue that this constituted a form of discursive 'hijacking,' marked by a narrowing of the scope of the problem definition and a reformulation of the political demands. We draw on user-generated Twitter data and focus on geolocation markers and language clusters in order to investigate the transnational scope of these coordinated efforts. We employ content analysis to investigate the campaign's strategic use of #MeToo. Our findings show distinct clusters of German-Austrian - and UK-US-based user groups, from which we infer directionalities in the transnational spread of the campaign. We demonstrate how the initial dissemination of the hashtag was driven by influential individual nodes within their respective networks and tied to #MeToo. The results point toward transnational networking activities among the far right and illustrate emerging dynamics between progressive and reactionary forms of digitally enabled networked framing.","[Knuepfer, Curd] Free Univ Berlin, John F Kennedy Inst, Berlin, Germany; [Hoffmann, Matthias; Voskresenskii, Vadim] Free Univ Berlin, Weizenbaum Inst Networked Soc, Berlin, Germany; [Hoffmann, Matthias; Voskresenskii, Vadim] Res Grp Digitalizat & Transnatl Publ Sphere, Berlin, Germany",Free University of Berlin; Free University of Berlin,"Knupfer, C (corresponding author), Free Univ Berlin, John F Kennedy Inst, Berlin, Germany.",curd.knuepfer@fu-berlin.de,"Knüpfer, Curd Benjamin/AFT-1547-2022","Hoffmann, Matthias/0000-0001-6480-3679; Knupfer, Curd Benjamin/0000-0002-9850-8325",Federal Ministry of Education and Research of Germany (BMBF) [16DII111],Federal Ministry of Education and Research of Germany (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),This work has been funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research of Germany (BMBF) under grant no. 16DII111 (Deutsches Internet-Institut).,,40,11,11,5,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Specifically, we analyze a unique survey data set from a national sample of 1512 U.S. adults that includes information about background attributes and behaviors, detailed measures of Internet experiences and skills, as well as questions about whether study participants had completed specific steps necessary to becoming a task worker on two prominent gig economy platforms: Amazon Mechanical Turk and TaskRabbit. We use Bayesian regression to compare four stages of gig economy participation. Workers who participate in the gig economy tend to be younger, more highly educated, and more skilled Internet users.

However, when that content is shared over larger intermediary networks of aligned supporters and media sites, it may become laundered or disconnected from its original sources so that parties can play it back as official communication. With a dynamic network analysis and various-time series analysis we tracked content flows from the German version of a global far-right anti-immigration campaign across different media platforms, including YouTube, Twitter, and collections of far-right and mainstream media sites. The analysis shows how content from the small extremist Identitarian Movement spread over expanding networks of low-level activists of the Alternative for Germany party and far-right alternative media sites. That network bridging enabled party leadership to launder the source of the content and roll out its own version of the campaign.

Digital methods - techniques exclusively focused on online data and shaped by the environment hosting these data - have become part and parcel of these investigations, often approaching platforms as hybrid assemblages of users, infrastructures, and algorithms. In its 'online groundness', this type of digital methods research, however, often tends to skim over the socio-cultural, contextual dimension of both wider social phenomena and social media uses and practices. In this paper, we advance a threefold contribution aimed at both sparking future efforts to address this limitation and aligning digital methods inquiry with contemporary epistemological debates that counter universalistic views of platforms and data. First, we question the degree to which digital methods can inform social investigations of collective events, issues or causes. Second, we advance a digital methods paradigm that addresses platforms as socio-cultural artifacts rather than hybrid assemblages. Finally, by reflecting on how we accessed, handled, and explored 9,000 Instagram visuals and around 400,000 Facebook comments to understand influences on middle class understandings of food consumption in Brazil and South Africa, we illustrate a way to design culturally sensitive digital methods research built on 'quanti-quali' practices.","[Vicari, Stefania; Kirby, Daniel] Univ Sheffield, Dept Sociol Studies, Elmfield Bldg,Northumberland Rd, Sheffield S10 2TU, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Vicari, S (corresponding author), Univ Sheffield, Dept Sociol Studies, Elmfield Bldg,Northumberland Rd, Sheffield S10 2TU, S Yorkshire, England.",s.vicari@sheffield.ac.uk,"Vicari, Stefania/AAG-7400-2022; Vicari, Stefania/AFL-7458-2022","Vicari, Stefania/0000-0002-4506-2358; Vicari, Stefania/0000-0002-4506-2358",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/R005303/1],Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),This work was supported by Economic and Social Research Council [grant number: ES/R005303/1].,,57,1,1,3,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Transmitting this data to the cloud, with its centralized data centers and high latency, is both economically and technically unviable. As a result, the industry is moving towards processing data closer to the source, a major shift from the cloud to the so-called edge. This new architecture is understood as a necessary augmentation to the cloud. Indeed, in many ways, the edge is the polar opposite of the cloud: ad hoc networks, composed of resource-poor devices, that function at the hyperlocal level of the home, office, or neighborhood. However, this article argues that such technical supplementation is also about control, filling a critical void in contemporary formations of power. Coupled together, this cloud-edge formation is both centralized and decentralized, resource intense yet geographically dispersed. Drawing on Foucauldian theory, such power augments heavy, situated force with a more flexible, economic architecture - conforming to a trajectory of 'intensification' while also complicating it.

We address this debate by studying how interest groups' utilization of digital media is associated with their success in influencing news media. We suggest digital media is characterized by the coexistence of old and new media logics that benefit resource-rich and resource-poor groups in different ways. Analyzing a dataset of 1,127 Finnish interest groups, we found that groups' utilization of digital media is positively associated with their news media success, yet traditional ways of influencing the news media remain more effective. Among resource-rich groups with larger public relations staff, blog publishing is positively associated with both media access (media visibility) and agenda-building success (influencing news topics). In contrast, utilization of digital media among resource-poor groups only correlates with agenda-building success, and audiovisual content is more effective than other content. We suggest that while resource-poor groups benefit from network media logic in which the flow of information is initially based on popularity among social media users, resource-rich groups can exploit mass media logic where traditional journalistic gatekeeping is more important. The findings also imply that digital media has not decreased resource-related bias in interest groups' media access.","[Vesa, Juho; Poutanen, Petro; Vehka, Mika] Univ Helsinki, Fac Social Sci, Unioninkatu 35,POB 18, Helsinki 00014, Finland; [Sund, Reijo] Univ Eastern Finland, Inst Clin Med, Kuopio, Finland",University of Helsinki; University of Eastern Finland,"Vesa, J (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Fac Social Sci, Unioninkatu 35,POB 18, Helsinki 00014, Finland.",Juho.vesa@helsinki.fi,"Poutanen, Petro/AAA-9472-2021; Sund, Reijo/N-5471-2016","Poutanen, Petro/0000-0001-7481-8495; Sund, Reijo/0000-0002-6268-8117; Vehka, Mika/0000-0001-8537-4180","Academy of Finland [309934]; Kone Foundation [088880]; Finnish Government's Analysis, Assessment and Research Activities under the 'KAMU'-project","Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland); Kone Foundation; Finnish Government's Analysis, Assessment and Research Activities under the 'KAMU'-project","This work was supported by the Academy of Finland under Grant number 309934; Kone Foundation under Grant 088880; and the Finnish Government's Analysis, Assessment and Research Activities under the 'KAMU'-project.",,59,2,2,3,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Non-disclosure and non-disparagement agreements, or HR blocking access for embedded research, are examples of how the industry can shield itself from outside view. Furthermore, when access is granted, researchers might find themselves constrained by their own timelines (tenure clocks, graduation deadlines, etc.) that are antithetical to long-term, embedded ethnographic research. In this article, I discuss an opportunity to look behind the curtain of the game industry via employee reviews left on Glassdoor, a popular job-seeking website. These reviews provide a means to gather worker perspectives in a way that reduces the potential for harm for those who speak out to counter the dominant, PR-polished narratives about working in the game industry being a 'dream job.' To demonstrate Glassdoor's utility as a supplemental data source for investigations of industry workplace cultures, I draw on employee reviews describing their experiences at Riot Games, developer of the Multiplayer Online Battle Arena League of Legends.

However, no one has demonstrated a causal effect of cell phone access on health and well-being. Using a 7-month longitudinal field experiment we investigated how stable cellphone access impacts health and quality of life of people experiencing poverty (N = 45, median annual income = $7,216). Participants received phone cards providing unlimited talk, text, and data (n = 23) or were given grocery store gift cards of the equivalent amount (n = 22). Over the course of the experiment, participants in the treatment group reported better health and quality of life compared to those in the control group. Emotional social support moderated this relationship in such a way that those with the least social support benefited the most from stable cellphone access (supporting a 'poor-get-richer' hypothesis).

The Mandarin translations in some ways operate like the English word, 'sharing'.Fenxianghas the meaning of participating in social media, andgongxiangrefers to technological aspects of sharing, while also conveying a sense of harmony. However, the interpersonal relations implied byfenxiang, and the political order implied bygongxiang, are quite different from those conveyed by 'sharing'. Together,fenxiangandgongxiangconstruct a convergence of micro-level interpersonal harmony and macro-level social harmony. Thus, the language of sharing becomes the lens through which to observe the subtlety, complexity and idiosyncrasies of the Chinese internet. This article offers a new heuristic for understanding Chinese social media, while also pointing to an important facet of the discursive construction of Chinese social media. This implies a continuing need to de-westernize research into the internet and to identify cultural-specific meanings of social media.","[Zhao, Luolin] Wuhan Univ, Ctr Studies Media Dev, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [John, Nicholas] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Commun & Journalism, Jerusalem, Israel",Wuhan University; Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"Zhao, LL (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, Ctr Studies Media Dev, Wuhan, Peoples R China.",luolin.zhao@whu.edu.cn,,,,,,,40,4,4,3,31,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

The search engines' algorithmic content selection strongly influences the diversity of the content received by the users - particularly since most users highly trust search engines and often click on only the first result. A widespread concern is that users are not informed diversely by search engines, but how far this concern applies has hardly been investigated. Our study is the first to investigate content diversity provided by five search engines on ten current political issues in Germany. The findings show that sometimes even the first result is highly diverse, but in most cases, more results must be considered to be informed diversely. This unreliability presents a serious challenge when using search engines as political news sources. Our findings call for media policy measures, for example in terms of algorithmic transparency.","[Steiner, Miriam; Stark, Birgit] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Dept Commun, Mainz, Germany; [Magin, Melanie; Geiss, Stefan] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Sociol & Polit Sci, Trondheim, Norway",Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz; Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Steiner, M (corresponding author), Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Dept Commun, Mainz, Germany.",miriam.steiner@uni-mainz.de,,"Magin, Melanie/0000-0003-2545-3594",research program 'media convergence' (located at the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz),research program 'media convergence' (located at the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz),This work was supported by the research program 'media convergence' (located at the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz).,,59,15,15,5,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

'Shared networks' are first-mile signal-sharing practices that articulate interconnection infrastructure and values of coexistence to, in the cases studied, extend the internet to areas where the services of existing larger internet service providers are unsatisfactory or unavailable. It argues that by infrastructuring their own local networks and interconnecting to the global internet, Tseltal and Zapoteco people are effectively internet codesigners, building Latin-Centric Indigenous networks and shaping internet governance from below. When comunalidad values, supported by unlicensed frequencies of the electromagnetic spectrum, towers, radio antennas, houses' rooftops, routers, and cables, intersect with the values of the internet service providers and their policies, hybrids emerge. Shared networks are a result of what these hybrids enact and constrain, as well as evidence of the vivid struggles for a more inclusive and pluriversal internet.","[Rosa, Fernanda R.] Virginia Tech, Sci Technol & Soc, 280 Alumni Mall,321 Lane Hall, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA",Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University,"Rosa, FR (corresponding author), Virginia Tech, Sci Technol & Soc, 280 Alumni Mall,321 Lane Hall, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",fernandarosa@riseup.net,,,Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs; Carnegie Corporation of New York; Red en Defensa de los Derechos Digitales,Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs; Carnegie Corporation of New York; Red en Defensa de los Derechos Digitales,This work was supported by Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs and Carnegie Corporation of New York: [Grant Number Tech & Policy Fellowship]; Red en Defensa de los Derechos Digitales: [Grant Number Google Policy Fellowship].,,77,1,1,2,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Prerequisites for and impacts of user (consumer) engagement with the Internet of Things are becoming increasingly recognized as an important study area. To support related research and policy development, there is a need for more theoretically informed, reliable, and valid instruments that are able to measure what people do and gain from the IoT. In the current contribution, we focus on a key component in digital inclusion debates: digital skills. The development of the IoT Skills Scale (IoTSS) started with examining existing digital skills theory which led to a first instrument. We used a threefold approach to test the validity and reliability of the latent skill constructs and the corresponding items: cognitive interviews, followed by a first survey of IoT skills. During the final step, we examined the consistency of the IoT skills scales and their characteristics when measured in second survey among a representative sample survey of Dutch Internet users. The result is a theoretical and empirical consistent framework consisting of two types of IoT skills: operational and data IoT skills and strategic IoT skills.","[van Deursen, Alexander J. A.

Video games have become a reference framework for teenagers, in which gaming practices may be important parts of their identity and social context. In addition, many teens see gaming as a professional possibility. This study provides five new gamer categories based on data from four focus groups carried out in Spain with teens from 12 to 16 years old. The 'escapist-gamer' and the 'ashamed-gamer' categories are based on teens' gaming practices, and the 'celebrity-platform-gamer', the 'professional-gamer' and the 'poser-gamer' are based on the adolescents' cultural imaginaries and aspirations. These categories demonstrate that certain male game practices are explicit, while female game practices are silenced. Moreover, sociodemographic characteristics complexify inequalities further, resulting in a struggle against normative models of femininity and masculinity, and determining teens' aspirations and conceptions of the video game world. Thus, the gamer categories exemplify how video games are currently playing a pivotal role in forging unequal gender and social identities. And, at the same time, these categories show how teens struggle against heteronormative values associated with the game industry.","[Vilasis-Pamos, Julia] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Dept Commun, C Roc Boronat 138, Barcelona 08018, Spain; [Pires, Fernanda] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Audiovisual Commun & Advertising, Bellaterra, Spain",Pompeu Fabra University; Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Vilasis-Pamos, J (corresponding author), Univ Pompeu Fabra, Dept Commun, C Roc Boronat 138, Barcelona 08018, Spain.",julia.vilasis@upf.edu,"Vilasís-Pamos, Júlia/AAR-6640-2021","Vilasís-Pamos, Júlia/0000-0002-2060-4544; Pires de Sa, Fernanda/0000-0001-6172-7594",,,,,46,3,3,3,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Relying on the notion that algorithms are socio-technical systems that comprise both technical and human components, this paper examines internet users' awareness of algorithms in different areas of internet use and inquires into users' perceptions of the impact of algorithms on their autonomy when interacting online. Empirically, we rely on qualitative interviews with 30 German internet users. Findings indicate that users in general are aware of algorithms operating in a wide range of applications and demonstrate a basic understanding of how these systems work. In line with the third-person effect, users perceive algorithms to have a stronger impact on others' internet use than on their own. Further, users' awareness of algorithms was found to be closely related to their perceived autonomy. When users feel in control of their interactions online, they are less aware of the impact of algorithms governing their interactions. Based on these results, we discuss the implications for transparency measures in algorithm regulation.","[Dogruel, Leyla; Facciorusso, Dominique; Stark, Birgit] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Dept Commun, Jakob Welder Weg 12, D-55128 Mainz, Germany",Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz,"Dogruel, L (corresponding author), Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Dept Commun, Jakob Welder Weg 12, D-55128 Mainz, Germany.",dogruel@uni-mainz.de,,,,,,,45,7,7,22,71,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

The empirical material comprises dyadic interviews with 61 adolescents. The interviews were analysed using an interpretative approach focusing on the construction of action and meaning. The analysis foregrounds trust and agency as two dimensions. This way normative assumptions become visible as stereotypes, sometimes positioned as ideals towards which to strive, other times as deterrent examples: the non-evaluator, the naive evaluator, the skeptical evaluator and the confident evaluator. The created stereotypes help to comprehend different understandings of critical assessment of information and how these can bring about different actions. The article argues that critical assessment of information as an element in media and information literacy must be understood not just in relation to how it is used to assess the credibility of information, but also regarding how it is performatively enrolled in the shaping of knowledge and in the creation of ignorance and doubt.","[Haider, Jutta] Univ Boras, Swedish Sch Lib & Informat Sci, Boras, Sweden; [Sundin, Olof] Lund Univ, Dept Arts & Cultural Sci, Lund, Sweden",University of Boras; Lund University,"Haider, J (corresponding author), Univ Boras, Swedish Sch Lib & Informat Sci, Boras, Sweden.",jutta.haider@hb.se,,"Haider, Jutta/0000-0002-8293-8208; Sundin, Olof/0000-0001-6352-8580",Swedish Research Council [2017-03631],Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research CouncilEuropean Commission),This work was supported by the Swedish Research Council [grant number 2017-03631].,,40,13,13,4,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

This research examines a purposefully selected sample of projects that feature participatory cultural heritage practices and offers a collective analysis of their objectives and motivations, the varying levels of engagement, the technology-mediated participatory activities supported, and how the projects are resourced and sustained. The findings indicate that the enabling of participation through digital platforms vary in nature, depth and extent, and a spectrum approach can be a useful way of conceptualising and envisaging the various levels of engagement in participatory cultural heritage. The collective analysis shows that when projects are designed with a human-centred computing focus and a community-oriented foundation, there is evidence of deeper engagement and sustained participation.","[Liew, Chern Li; Goulding, Anne; Nichol, Max] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Informat Management, POB 600, Wellington 6140, New Zealand",Victoria University Wellington,"Liew, CL (corresponding author), Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Informat Management, POB 600, Wellington 6140, New Zealand.",ChernLi.Liew@vuw.ac.nz,,,"Victoria University of Wellington, FCA Grant [220764]","Victoria University of Wellington, FCA Grant","This work was supported by Victoria University of Wellington, FCA Grant: [Grant Number 220764].",,53,6,6,4,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Coinciding with Vietnam's rollout of chip-based national identification cards for citizens over the age of 14, the development of a one-stop 'super-app' solution that streamlines data flows across different domains of authority happened in a context where platforms were increasingly discussed alongside, and understood on the same terms as, infrastructure. By conducting situational analysis of publicly available policy documents and official government communication, the paper traces how pandemic platforms contract and expand in response to evolving pandemic management needs, and gives an account of the evolution of institutional dependency across different domains of authority and technology development. Using Vietnam as a case study, this paper contributes to ongoing theorisation at the intersection of platformisation and infrastructuralisation in pandemic social service provision. The paper is an invitation to examine the increasing entanglements of technology and citizenship performances around the world as they unfold throughout the course of the pandemic and beyond.","[Dang Nguyen] RMIT Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Automated Decis Making & Soc, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia",Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Nguyen, D (corresponding author), RMIT Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Automated Decis Making & Soc, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia.",dang.nguyen@rmit.edu.au,,"Nguyen, Dang/0000-0003-1280-3444",,,,,37,0,0,1,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

We utilized novel Screenomics data, comprehensive sequences of screenshots (N = 13,498,584) collected every 5 seconds from the smartphones of lower-income and higher-income adults (N = 65) in U.S. metropolitan areas for 2 months. While examining a person's everyday smartphone use, we observed 103 natural exposures to advertisements of payday lenders who had in the past generated consumer complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. We describe how individuals encountered payday loan ads through various digital channels despite the ad bans of major technology companies. We employed a quasi-experimental design to test for differences in participant actions immediately before and after ad exposure. Multilevel analysis results show that exposure to payday loan ads led to notable changes in the lower-income individuals' smartphone use. Directly after seeing the ads, the lower-income individuals engaged with content that contained fewer future-oriented words, switched between applications more frequently, and avoided content that evoked negative emotions. Such effects were especially pronounced among the lower-income individuals who lacked the support of social safety nets, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (formerly known as food stamps) and unemployment benefits. In contrast, there were no changes noted in smartphone use among the lower-income individuals receiving social safety net assistance and higher-income individuals. These findings highlight the nuanced yet impactful psychological consequences of digital experiences, an underexplored aspect of digital inequalities.","[Lee, Jihye; Hamilton, James T.; Ram, Nilam; Roehrick, Katherine; Reeves, Byron] Stanford Univ, Dept Commun, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Ram, Nilam] Stanford Univ, Dept Psychol, Stanford, CA USA",Stanford University; Stanford University,"Lee, J (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, Moody Coll Commun, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",jihye.lee@austin.utexas.edu,,"Ram, Nilam/0000-0003-1671-5257",John S. and James L.

In that context, abortion among white women is perceived by white nationalists (WN) as a betrayal of their 'biological' and 'traditional' gender role - procreation of white babies. While WN condemn abortion among white women as a murderous sin, at times they encourage the practice among nonwhites to solve demographic threats to white dominance. In this study, we use mixed methods, combining unsupervised machine learning with close textual analysis of 30,725 posts including the term 'abortion' published on the WN website Stormfront between 2001 and 2017. We identify three broad themes: White genocide, focused on the conspiracy theory and detailing the active actors in its alleged execution; political, focused on political agendas and laws; and WN reproductive reasoning, articulating and justifying the contradiction between supporting abortion for nonwhites but not for whites via politics of difference that emphasize nonwhites' supposed inferior morality. We discuss WN's unique and explicitly racist discourse around a medical topic like abortion, a staple of the conservative and religious right for decades, and how it is used to alleviate their cognitive dissonance resulting from their dual-stance on abortion. Such discourse could be harnessed to recruit members into the movement and normalize extreme, racist ideologies.","[Ophir, Yotam; Wang, Rui] SUNY Buffalo, Dept Commun, Univ Buffalo, 333 Baldy Hall, Buffalo, NY 14228 USA; [Pruden, Meredith L.] Univ N Carolina, Ctr Informat Technol & Publ Life, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA; [Walter, Dror] Georgia State Univ, Dept Commun, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Lokmanoglu, Ayse D.] Northwestern Univ, Dept Commun, Evanston, IL 60201 USA; [Tebaldi, Catherine] Univ Massachusetts, Coll Educ, Amherst, MA 01003 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University System of Georgia; Georgia State University; Northwestern University; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst,"Ophir, Y (corresponding author), SUNY Buffalo, Dept Commun, Univ Buffalo, 333 Baldy Hall, Buffalo, NY 14228 USA.",yotamoph@buffalo.edu,"Lokmanoglu, Ayse/GSN-3750-2022","Lokmanoglu, Ayse/0000-0003-1699-2684; Ophir, Yotam/0000-0001-5049-7906; Wang, Rui/0000-0001-6535-1694; Walter, Dror/0000-0001-9870-998X; Pruden, Meredith L./0000-0001-8872-4289",,,,,87,1,1,5,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Networked publics, as agents of this field, are competing overpower by performing networked practices. To investigate this field, we focused on two networked practices: networked framing and narrating. Persian Twitter in 2017 presidential election provides a good context to analyze how such a field is constituted. Combining a social-network analytic approach with discursive and textual interpretations, we analyzed a corpus of 2,596,284 tweets. We identified three main networked publics in the retweet network: reformists, conservatives, and diaspora users. Having identified the most influential users in each community based on PageRank metric, we thoroughly investigated all of their tweets. The results show that ordinary users constituted the major population of conservative and diaspora publics. The reformist community included mostly journalists and to a lesser extent media. Findings also confirm that all networked publics used the same strategies to gain more power in the field. They produced quite the same frames and narratives to compete with each other. Moreover, the battle was more about the routine and electoral debates, not the legitimacy or entity of regime. Hence, none of the networked publics challenged the hegemonic discourse in Iran significantly.","[Kermani, Hossein] Univ Vienna, A-1010 Vienna, Austria; [Tafreshi, Amirali] Univ Tehran, Tehran, Iran",University of Vienna; University of Tehran,"Kermani, H (corresponding author), Univ Vienna, A-1010 Vienna, Austria.",Hossein.Kermani@univie.ac.at,,"Tafreshi, Amirali/0000-0003-0252-4396; Kermani, Hossein/0000-0002-6626-1364",,,,,72,1,1,1,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

This paper explores whether there is a preponderance of such easy data in digital activism research through a systematic review of relevant journal articles published between 2011 and 2018 (N = 315). Specifically, it examines whether computational digital methods have become increasingly prominent in digital activism research during this period. A key focus of the paper is the extent to which digital activism research focused on easily accessible Twitter data, and whether these were obtained via standard API services. Results indicate that (1) traditional research methodologies were more commonly deployed in these articles than digital methods, but (2) Twitter was the most researched platform in the corpus, and (3) single-platform hashtag studies were an archetype of digital activism research alongside single-platform Facebook studies and holistic approaches (hybrid, multi-method & multi-sited, e.g., ethnography). The paper concludes by advocating for greater diversity in terms of the methodological approaches adopted in digital activism research.","[Ozkula, Suay M.] Univ Trento, Sch Int Studies, Trento, Italy; [Reilly, Paul J.; Hayes, Jenny] Univ Sheffield, Informat Sch, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England",University of Trento; University of Sheffield,"Ozkula, SM (corresponding author), Univ Trento, Sch Int Studies, Trento, Italy.",suaymelisa.ozkula@unitn.it,"Reilly, Paul J/P-3803-2016","Reilly, Paul J/0000-0002-6890-778X; Ozkula, Suay/0000-0002-1674-5491; Hayes, Jennifer/0000-0001-6805-4927",,,,,43,3,3,9,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

In this context, the German Network Enforcement Act ('NetzDG') has become the epitome of the concept of new-school speech regulation: the increasing co-optation of intermediaries for governmental content moderation - with all its potential harms to free expression and democratic discourse. Contrary to this trend, however, recent legislative measures in Germany, including the Interstate Media Treaty (IMT), suggest that the country is exploring new avenues in digital intermediary regulation. Not only does the new German legislation focus on procedural instead of substantive aspects of content moderation, offering a case study for concepts promoted by recent literature on platform regulation. By introducing a positive bias for certain 'content of value,' the country also includes the role of beneficial content in its regulation. This paper analyzes the new German countermovement against new-school regulation and presents its potential impact for future regulatory concepts.","[Klausa, Torben] Bielefeld Univ, Fac Law, Bielefeld, Germany",University of Bielefeld,"Klausa, T (corresponding author), Bielefeld Univ, Fac Law, Bielefeld, Germany.",torben.klausa@uni-bielefeld.de,,"Klausa, Torben/0000-0002-6843-4994",,,,,56,1,1,2,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Our findings suggest there is growing engagement with convergence culture in Eastern DRC but radio remains a primary and invaluable source of news relating to politics, health, entertainment, and regional conflict.

Yet, while research has begun to explore far-right groups' social media hyperlinking activities, relatively little is known about the purposes and communicative functions of this form of communication. By combining social network analysis and qualitative content analysis on Facebook data obtained from 17 PEGIDA and Generation Identity Facebook pages in the period around the so-called 'refugee crisis' (2015-2017), this exploratory study investigates the linked source types and their purposes. We find that the groups predominantly link to mainstream media, far-right media and far-right non-institutional groups. While there are great overlaps in the communicative functions and purposes of the links for the two networks, the PEGIDA groups mainly focus on the promotion of political issues, especially around the opposition to third-country (Muslim) immigration, while the GI groups use them for self-promotional purposes. These differences are largely explainable by the groups' adverse (online) mobilization aims.","[Tornberg, Anton] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Sociol & Work Sci, Box 720, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Tornberg, Anton; Nissen, Anita] Aalborg Univ, Dept Polit & Soc, Aalborg, Denmark",University of Gothenburg; Aalborg University,"Tornberg, A (corresponding author), Univ Gothenburg, Dept Sociol & Work Sci, Box 720, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden.",anton.tornberg@gu.se,,"Tornberg, Anton/0000-0002-5847-3033; Nissen, Anita/0000-0003-1701-6925",,,,,52,0,0,6,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Do they engage in a variety of activities? Are they media literate in relation to these social networks, and how do they develop these competences? This article focuses on the relationships between young adults' social network practices and the development of their media literacy competences. Based on responses from 350 Belgian young adults, we identify profiles based on frequency and diversity of their practices. These profiles correlate with different levels of media literacy. We observe no relationship between frequency of participants' reception practices (reviewing their newsfeed, reading posts, conducting in-depth research) and the development of their media literacy competences. However, we observe that the more young adults diversify these reception practices, the better their media literacy competences are. Conversely, and surprisingly, the more often they produce media content and the more they diversify these production practices (creating and sharing posts), the less media literate they appear to be.","[Tilleul, Camille] Catholic Univ Louvain, Grp Rech Mediat Savoirs GReMS, Inst Langage & Commun IL & C, 14 Bte 2-03-02, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium",Universite Catholique Louvain,"Tilleul, C (corresponding author), Catholic Univ Louvain, Grp Rech Mediat Savoirs GReMS, Inst Langage & Commun IL & C, 14 Bte 2-03-02, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium.",camille.tilleul@uclouvain.be,,,,,,,42,0,0,10,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Here, we apply the reinforcing spirals model to examine whether, and how, social media news use shapes populist attitudes over time. Specifically, we assess if using social media as a news source serves to maintain existing populist attitudes or facilitates a shift in attitudes to a more extreme position. A cross-sectional survey (N (1) = 195) highlighted a positive correlation between social media news use and populist attitudes. A four-wave longitudinal survey (N (2) = 386) further showed that this relationship reflects media and selection effects. Over a period of three months, more frequent social media news use predicted stronger populist attitudes at subsequent measuring points. In addition, higher levels of populist attitudes were related to more frequent social media news consumption in the following waves. However, the frequency of social media news use did not change over time and populist attitudes did not become stronger during the study period. Taken together, the findings indicate that social media news use contributed to the maintenance of populist attitudes at a stable level. There is no evidence to suggest social media news use predicted more extreme populist attitudes. We discuss these results with respect to the (potentially continued) rise of populism; we also critically reflect on the phenomenon of attitude polarization online.","[Schumann, Sandy] UCL, London, England; [Thomas, Fabian; Ehrke, Franziska; Bertlich, Tisa; Dupont, Julia C.] Univ Koblenz Landau, Landau, Germany",University of London; University College London; University of Koblenz & Landau,"Schumann, S (corresponding author), UCL, London, England.",s.schumann@ucl.ac.uk,"Ehrke, Franziska/AAN-5992-2021","Schumann, Sandy/0000-0002-0900-5356; Ehrke, Franziska/0000-0003-4205-1052","European Association of Social Psychology; Forschungsinitiative Rheinland-Pfalz, Research focus Communication, Media and Politics","European Association of Social Psychology; Forschungsinitiative Rheinland-Pfalz, Research focus Communication, Media and Politics","This work was supported by the European Association of Social Psychology; Forschungsinitiative Rheinland-Pfalz, Research focus Communication, Media and Politics.",,59,2,2,4,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

We drew on theories of time to understand how time was conceptualised and used in the digital communications between young people and their clinical teams. Through the lens of time we show that digital communications are valued differently by young people with long-term conditions and their clinical teams. In the current policy landscape where there is an emphasis on digital technology understanding the temporalities of different groups will help in the introduction of appropriate digital communications channels.

Exploring four European alternative far-right media: PI-News in Germany, Il Primato Nazionale in Italy, the UK localization of Breitbart, and the transnational Voice of Europe, we show that these media have gone beyond (dis)informing and have actively mobilized and channeled indignation through petitioning and protest organization. While most research on far-right media practices so far has focused either on social media interactions or exclusively on 'disinformation' and 'fake news', we analyse web based alternative news media as part of a far-right social movement that has successfully used progressive left-wing protests repertoires and tactics. We argue that alternative far-right news media act as 'indignation mobilization mechanisms' that not only fuel the indignation of the public by channeling the messages of far-right politicians but also channel bottom-up indignation through online campaigns, petitions, and offline street protests. This unabashedly biased and mobilization-oriented approach is what distinguishes far-right media from mainstream media and guarantees them a loyal and dedicated supporter base.","[Rone, Julia] Univ Cambridge, Minderoo Ctr Technol & Democracy CRASSH, Cambridge, England",University of Cambridge,"Rone, J (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Minderoo Ctr Technol & Democracy CRASSH, Cambridge, England.",julia.rone@eui.eu,,"Rone, Julia/0000-0003-0937-0270",,,,,95,7,7,2,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Social media platforms facilitate, define and amplify debate about this topic. They give rise to counterpublic spaces through which counterpublics such as climate sceptics get a stage they would not easily get in mainstream media. Previous research suggests that sceptics use these spaces as safe havens, but also as bases for interventions in the hegemonic debate. Applying a multideterminant frame model, we analyse the Twitter debate among climate change 'sceptics' and 'believers'. We study all tweets in which the heat wave was related to climate change and which were shared by Dutch and Flemish users between 28 July 2018 and 4 August 2018. Laying bare the worldviews underlying the frames of sceptics and non-sceptics, we first demonstrate the diversity of - unilaterally interacting - ideological interests. Building upon this analysis of the scope of the debate and analysing its form, we show that both groups mostly use similar antagonistic strategies to delegitimize and denaturalize their out-groups. We argue that these interventions promote polarization rather than a constructive agonistic debate. As such, this study refutes previous studies that consider sceptic frames as deconstructive and non-sceptic frames as constructive.","[Moernaut, Renee; Mast, Jelle; Temmerman, Martina] Vrije Univ Brussel, Brussels Inst Journalism Studies, Dept Linguist & Literary Studies, Pleinlaan 11, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Broersma, Marcel] Univ Groningen, Ctr Media & Journalism Studies, Groningen, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Brussel; University of Groningen,"Mast, J (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Brussel, Brussels Inst Journalism Studies, Dept Linguist & Literary Studies, Pleinlaan 11, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.",jelle.mast@vub.be,,"Temmerman, Martina/0000-0002-1482-8488; Broersma, Marcel/0000-0002-7342-3472",,,,,31,5,5,5,31,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

The findings indicate that parents develop their social and family relationships by disclosing their child's personal information. In addition, the findings show that some participants' concerns regarding the drawbacks of sharenting are rooted in the cultural manifestation of the 'evil eye'.

This article explores the potential of collecting internet memes, a specific form of digital media, to further these institutional aims. Through an empirical study of a youth engagement program at a Norwegian folklore archive, we conclude that collecting and contextualizing image macros in collaboration with young people is an institutionally viable and inclusionary approach to documenting new expressions of culture and everyday life. The project further created a context in which young people could exercise competencies related to the development of a civic identity. These findings are relevant for cultural heritage institutions which aim to diversify the forms of digital media, knowledge practices and perspectives represented in their collections, and for cultural heritage professionals who aim to engage youth or marginalized communities. Extending recent research on internet memes as resources for meaning-making the study also underscores the value of participatory research methodologies which deliberately invite individuals' interpretations of digital culture and analytical approaches that account for the richness of internet memes and image macros as semiotic resources for narrating identity.","[Oswald, Emily C.; Pierroux, Palmyre] Univ Oslo, Dept Educ, Oslo, Norway; [Esborg, Line] Univ Oslo, Dept Culture Studies & Oriental Languages, Oslo, Norway",University of Oslo; University of Oslo,"Oswald, EC (corresponding author), Postboks 1092, N-0317 Oslo, Norway.",emilyco@uio.no; esborg@ikos.uio.no; palmyre.pierroux@iped.uio.no,,,Norges Forskningsrad [247611],Norges Forskningsrad,This work was supported by Norges Forskningsrad [grant number 247611].,,49,0,0,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Yet, on the backdrop of a persistent digital divide between rural and urban communities, many Australian farmers are not taking up digital AgTech. It has been argued that these farmers are being 'left behind' in an increasingly digital world, and this may impact their future success. Scholars of digital AgTech adoption typically take a siloed approach, positioning the individual or farm as the key unit of analysis, with fewer studies addressing structural conditions. This has provided a useful but incomplete understanding of the disparity between users and non-users. This paper builds upon emerging sociocultural approaches, which aim to address this gap, by using a novel 'communitive ecology' analytical approach to consider how adoption occurs through networks of actors. Based on an exploratory, qualitative study of a digital farming project on a cotton farm and its digital communicative ecology in South-East Queensland, Australia this study identifies technological, discursive, and social factors of digital AgTech adoption. Overall, an evolution from a digital divide to data divide, expressed in the interactions between farmers and stakeholders, and characterised by gaps between the generation and application of farm data, is observed.","[Marshall, Amber] Queensland Univ Technol, Digital Media Res Ctr, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Turner, Krystle] Queensland Univ Technol, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Richards, Carol] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Management, Business Sch, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Foth, Marcus] Queensland Univ Technol, Design Lab, Urban Informat, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Dezuanni, Michael] Queensland Univ Technol, Digital Media Res Ctr, Digital Inclus & Participat, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",Queensland University of Technology (QUT); Queensland University of Technology (QUT); Queensland University of Technology (QUT); Queensland University of Technology (QUT); Queensland University of Technology (QUT),"Marshall, A (corresponding author), Queensland Univ Technol, Digital Media Res Ctr, Level 5,Z1 Musk Ave, Kelvin Grove, Qld 4059, Australia.",amber.marshall@qut.edu.au; k.vichie@qut.edu.au; k.vichie@qut.edu.au; m.foth@qut.edu.au; m.dezuanni@qut.edu.au,"; Foth, Marcus/I-9914-2012","Turner, Krystle/0000-0001-6240-0227; Richards, Carol/0000-0001-9887-175X; Marshall, Amber/0000-0002-2354-4284; Foth, Marcus/0000-0001-9892-0208; Dezuanni, Michael/0000-0002-2278-8455","Centre for Agriculture and the Bioeconomy, Queensland University of Technology","Centre for Agriculture and the Bioeconomy, Queensland University of Technology","This work was supported by Centre for Agriculture and the Bioeconomy, Queensland University of Technology.",,43,0,0,26,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Data were collected through a web-based survey in South Korea. Participants were smartphone users who had a child using a smartphone under six years. There were 357 responses in the sample. Roughly 80.4% of parents were in their 30s, and 46.5% of children were toddlers aged 1-3 years. We used structural equation modeling to investigate the relation between children's smartphone overuse and parenting-related variables. Parenting style influences parenting efficacy, which decreases parenting stress and smartphone overuse among both parents and children. Parents' smartphone overuse also influences children's smartphone overuse. Young children's smartphone overuse affects their activity, emotional sensitivity, and sociability. Finally, smartphone overuse and emotional sensitivity are higher in toddlers than preschoolers. Our results provide practical implications for the parents, government, and providers of content for young children. First, parents should delay their young children's smart devices usage, watch together, and communicate when their young children use smart devices. Second, government should provide timely information about parenting. Finally, content providers should make content shorter and provide warnings to take breaks, and develop content that improves children's activity and sociability, and tailoring content to particular age groups.","[Lee, Ae Ri] Sangmyung Univ, Dept Business Adm, Seoul, South Korea; [Park, Yong Wan] Gyeongsang Natl Univ, Dept Business Adm, Jinju, South Korea; [Oh, Joohyun] Yonsei Univ, Inst Social Dev Studies, Seoul 03722, South Korea",Sang Myung University; Gyeongsang National University; Yonsei University,"Oh, J (corresponding author), Yonsei Univ, Inst Social Dev Studies, Seoul 03722, South Korea.",ohjoo37@gmail.com,,"Oh, Joohyun/0000-0001-9457-2357; Lee, Ae Ri/0000-0001-6657-155X",,,,,53,0,0,8,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Many studies have addressed the media consumption of undecideds but few have examined the role of undecideds' attitudes towards the media institution. This paper is innovative in its attempt to address the issue of the role of media trust in undecided versus decided voters' media engagement, based on a survey (N = 1427) followed by a multivariate analysis during the Israeli April 2019 elections campaign. The analysis revealed that although decided voters have more doubt in the accuracy of the news media, they still consume more news from more diverse sources, highlighting decideds as more critical and simultaneously more informed than undecideds. A parallel experiment (N = 121) identified that undecideds tended to rank a fake news item shared by one of their Facebook friends as credible significantly more often than decideds, demonstrating undecideds' lower critical ability to identify misinformation. The present study highlights the under-explored roles of undecideds (mis)trust of the news media and high susceptibility to believe fake news items, thus adding new evidence to the notion that elections are often won by the least informed and least critical citizens.

Activists' digital crowdmaps express an ethos of Indigenous data sovereignty, or self-determination in data collection and application, that interrogates settler data procedures relative to gender violence. These tactical maps resonate with the circulation of location-tagged photographs via social media campaigns like #ImNotNext and #RedDressProject to similarly critique the datasets of government agencies. This article conceptualizes both media forms as informatic images that intervene in settler cartographic practice as part of an ongoing decolonization of digital mapping tools. Informatic images precondition the ways that users interact with data through hypermediated visual systems. Here, digital mapping and locative media practices focalize a relationship between violence, biased data and space, through various methods of layering, compositing and linking. Settler computational structures undergird these affordances, yet in a tactical context mapped images are reconstituted by user interaction with an oppositional dataset to intervene in that framework. Users' emergent data of presence and absence plot a distributed landscape of settler violence in accordance, instead, with relational Indigenous knowledges.","[Miner, Joshua D.] Univ Kansas, Dept Film & Media Studies, 1300 Sunnyside Ave,Suite 230, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA",University of Kansas,"Miner, JD (corresponding author), Univ Kansas, Dept Film & Media Studies, 1300 Sunnyside Ave,Suite 230, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA.",j.d.miner@ku.edu,"Miner, Joshua/ABC-9995-2021","Miner, Joshua/0000-0002-1296-5470",,,,,41,3,3,2,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Drawing on an interactionist approach, this study argues that in this intermediate situation, NGOs are relatively autonomous, organizing their campaigns and initiatives independently instead of partnering with the state. However, these two sides both spur and exploit each other, shaping an 'interactive field.' Data actors use the state's open data agenda as an opportunity to initiate spin-off data activism to counteract the deficiencies of data disclosure by the government. In response, state agencies adjust and enhance their data disclosure practices, thus performing reactive data governance. We identified several dynamics of this interactive field: (1) It involves multiple grassroots data actors in the form of NGOs that attempt to expand the autonomy of their data advocacy by forming activist networks to bargain with state bureaucracy. (2) The interactive strategies mainly involve tactics of 'rightful resistance' but are hybridized with other boundary-spanning strategies that straddle the demarcation of confrontation and non-confrontation. (3) Although the state and nonstate actors are not partnered, they exert mutual influence over each other's actions and strategies. The shrinking of institutional space has caused NGOs to reorganize interactive strategies. Our study also highlights the local geopolitical dynamics that condition such interactions: besides the inter-administrative dynamics that afford political opportunities, the trans-local advocacy network coordinates actors and resources to exercise data counterpower. Also, the selection of advocacy strategies is varied with targeted government agencies.","[Huang, Vincent Guangsheng; Lyu, Yuexin] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Media & Int Culture, Hangzhou, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University,"Huang, VG (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ, Coll Media & Int Culture, Hangzhou, Peoples R China.",hguangsh@gmail.com; lyuexin0607@gmail.com,,,Research Start-up Fund from `Hundred Talents Program' of Zhejiang University; National Social Science Fund of China [21ZD318],Research Start-up Fund from `Hundred Talents Program' of Zhejiang University; National Social Science Fund of China,This work was supported by The Research Start-up Fund from `Hundred Talents Program' of Zhejiang University; the National Social Science Fund of China: [Grant Number 21&ZD318].,,48,0,0,11,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

This paper investigates the articulation between sharenting as performed by celebrities and the wider construction of children's digital identities. Through qualitative content analysis, this research looks at how Cristiano Ronaldo, the most-followed individual on Instagram since 2018, his partner, and his mother shared information about his children on that social media platform between 2018 and 2020. Through manual exploration, we searched for Ronaldo's children across a variety of digital spaces. Our analysis reveals that sharenting on Instagram engages audiences through the portrayal of children as the parents' extended self. Content from Instagram and news media is appropriated in vernacular and commercial digital spaces for conflicting affects: the cute father-son dyad, and the son as extension of the uber-famous, vain father. This extreme case shows how the digital identities of children of celebrities are widely public, formed by the everyday, intimate content of the family's life, which is persistent and collectively recreated by news media, vernacular culture, and commercial platforms.","[Jorge, Ana] Lusofona Univ CICANT, ECATI, Lisbon, Portugal; [Maropo, Lidia] Polytech Inst Setubal, Higher Sch Educ, Dept Commun & Language Sci, Setubal, Portugal; [Maropo, Lidia] CICS NOVA, Lisbon, Portugal; [Neto, Filipa] ISCTE IUL, Sociol, Lisbon, Portugal",Instituto Politecnico de Setubal; Instituto Universitario de Lisboa,"Jorge, A (corresponding author), Lusofona Univ CICANT, ECATI, Lisbon, Portugal.",ana.jorge@ulusofona.pt,"Jorge, Ana/N-2163-2019","Jorge, Ana/0000-0002-4069-6212; Maropo, Lidia/0000-0003-4687-7628",,,,,62,0,0,8,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

To do so, we conduct a rigorous qualitative analysis of discourse during a two-week period in which the Florida legislature considered and passed the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Act after a shooter killed 17 people in Parkland, Florida. We systematically explore how two framing dynamics - competition and amplification - shape what frames political actors champion and the relative effects of these dynamics on individual claimsmaking in 438 letters to the editor and op-eds appearing in mainstream outlets, 4,962 emails sent to Florida Governor Rick Scott, and 1,000 tweets. We find that amplification and competition shape the relative visibility of frames and the frequency with which individuals use these frames in their claimsmaking. Generally speaking, gun control and progressive groups selectively amplified frames associated with the emerging, student-led Never Again Marjory Stoneman Douglas movement and legislative frames that were consistent with their goals. This seems to have increased the visibility of these ideas in mainstream outlets and influenced claimsmaking insofar as individuals drew on amplified frames across the forums relatively frequently. This was not true of frames opposing gun control. Gun rights groups bickered with politicians and among themselves. As a result, gun rights frames were less prevalent in mainstream discourse and in individual claimsmaking.","[Rohlinger, Deana A.; DeLucchi, Caitria] Florida State Univ, Dept Sociol, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Allen, Warren] Rutgers State Univ, Sch Commun & Informat, New Brunswick, NJ USA",State University System of Florida; Florida State University; Rutgers State University New Brunswick,"Rohlinger, DA (corresponding author), Florida State Univ, Dept Sociol, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.",deana.rohlinger@fsu.edu,,,,,,,34,0,0,3,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

This study investigates if and how public perceptions of gig work related to platform-based ride-hailing and food/grocery delivery services changed during the early stages of the pandemic. We collected a sample of 23,845 Twitter posts ('tweets') related to these platform-based services within two-week periods before and after the US COVID-19 emergency declaration. Sentiment analysis on tweets was conducted to investigate changes in public perception of gig work. Tweet content was analyzed by descriptively coding about 10% of the sample of tweets manually along ten different dimensions (e.g., personal experience, informative, and about driver); then we used thematic analysis to gain an understanding about the public's views towards gig work/workers. We tested supervised machine learning methods to explore their potential to classify the rest of the sample along the ten descriptive dimensions. The number of tweets increased by approximately 150% after the emergency declaration and became more positive in sentiment. Qualitative results indicate that tweets about negative personal experiences with drivers/companies decreased during COVID-19, while tweets exhibiting a sense of community (e.g., sharing information) and concern towards gig workers increased.

Digital media may provide the communication platforms on which supporters deliberate movement goals, share information, discuss tactics, and generate discourses in response to ongoing happenings. Yet digital media's capability to serve these functions should depend on platform-specific affordances and movement dynamics. Based on such premises, this article examines how the online forum LIHKG became the central communication platform in the Anti-Extradition Bill Movement in Hong Kong. Empirically, digital media and content analysis data help establish the forum's prominence during the first few months of the movement, while analyses of protest onsite survey data show how the use of LIHKG systematically related to several movement-related attitudes among the protesters. The article highlights the affordances and movement dynamics that allow the forum to play the role. It contributes to understanding the factors that shape the role and impact of digital media platforms in social mobilization.","[Lee, Francis L.

Research on the experiences of parents of premature children who have returned home from hospital points to the need for ongoing support as they navigate the transition to parenthood without the support of neonatal intensive care staff. For parents of premature infants, these platforms can act as wellsprings of information and also provide emotional and instrumental support during extended periods of hospitalisation. We used the walk-through method to analyse the support content and self-tracking features of five market-leading apps aimed at new parents of premature infants. This content analysis revealed that none of the analysed apps featured ongoing support for parents once they have returned home with their infants. Further analysis of the sociocultural dimensions of the digital content revealed the implicit reinforcement of the gendered expectations of parenthood and heteronormative nuclear families, thereby suggesting that women must enact the majority of caregiving and implicitly excluding users from same-sex or single-parent families. This research illuminates the need for more inclusive and gender-neutral app design and content that can offer ongoing digital support to parents of premature infants who have returned home from hospital.","[Byrt, Adrienne; Dempsey, Deborah] Swinburne Univ Technol, Dept Social Sci, 400B Burwood Rd, Melbourne, Vic 3122, Australia",Swinburne University of Technology,"Byrt, A (corresponding author), Swinburne Univ Technol, Dept Social Sci, 400B Burwood Rd, Melbourne, Vic 3122, Australia.",abyrt@swin.edu.au,,,,,,,36,1,1,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

The study explores implications of the findings on the current deadlock over the state preemption clause in developing a comprehensive federal privacy law.

A typology of online ironic markers,INFORMATION COMMUNICATION & SOCIETY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Irony; social media; boundary work; polysemy; interpretive failure,HUMOR,"Social media constitute a fertile though challenging arena for the use of ironic humor. A combination of facilitating and hindering factors turns the production and identification of irony in this sphere into a complex venture, positioning it as a powerful tool in consolidating group boundaries. The main aims of this paper are to identify the markers of ironic humor on social media and to explicate their workings within the dynamics of digital interactions. Existing literature about ironic markers addresses mostly face-to-face and mass-mediated interactions, while there is a gap in our understanding of the production and interpretation of irony in the unique communicative conditions of social media. An analysis of a bilingual corpus of successful and failed ironic utterances extracted from five social network sites yielded a novel typology of five ironic markers: platform, participants, style, intra-textual content, and contextual knowledge. These markers both resemble and deviate from features of irony in non-digital settings. Media affordances often allow access to necessary complementary information, yet such forensic activity is only accessible to active users, who recognize the need for further investigation of the meant. Hence, using certain types of ironic markers forms utterances that are decipherable to some audiences but opaque to others. In this sense, the marking of digital irony and its decoding both rely on group boundaries and play a central role in their delineation. We conclude by evaluating the roles of this new regime of ironic markers in processes of boundary work.","[Gal, Noam; Kampf, Zohar; Shifman, Limor] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Commun & Journalism, Jerusalem, Israel",Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"Gal, N (corresponding author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Commun & Journalism, Jerusalem, Israel.",noam.gal@mail.huji.ac.il,,"Kampf, Zohar/0000-0003-3563-1403",Smart Institute at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem,Smart Institute at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem,This research was supported by the Smart Institute at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.,,34,3,3,1,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

This article examines queer people's response to such measures through a study of Club Quarantine (Club Q), a series of online queer club nights established during the early days of Canada's lockdown in March 2020. It draws on mixed methods to explore Club Q's negotiation of Zoom videoconferencing software for hosting and animating club nights, combining participant observation with examination of Club Q's promotion and media coverage as well as applying the walkthrough method to Zoom. Findings show that Club Q appropriated Zoom through redefinition, adaptation, and reinvention of the platform, reorienting its purpose from business solutions to queer representation, connection, and solidarity. We conclude that Club Q merges off-label use, as technological appropriation that negotiates hurdles specific to platform technology, governance, and economic interests, with queer use--activity that establishes queer space. We conceptualize this queer appropriation as 'off-label queer use': practices of platform appropriation that release a queer potentiality for challenging heteronormative and marginalizing technosocial structures. Club Q challenged platform features and policies that constrained sexual expression and posed safety risks for queer users while providing a queer space for fostering resilience and solidarity during crisis. This article's theoretical contribution enables the identification of off-label queer use in other arrangements of users and technology, allowing for an understanding of when platforms facilitate or inhibit queer survival strategies.","[Duguay, Stefanie; Trepanier, Anne-Marie; Chartrand, Alex] Concordia Univ, Dept Commun Studies, Montreal, PQ, Canada",Concordia University - Canada,"Duguay, S (corresponding author), Concordia Univ, Dept Commun Studies, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",stefanie.duguay@concordia.ca,,"Duguay, Stefanie/0000-0002-9796-0619",Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [430-2019-00866],Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),This work was supported by Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada: [Grant Number 430-2019-00866].,,70,0,0,1,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Much of that research employs self-reported measures obtained with surveys, known to suffer from accuracy problems. Observational measures, however, also suffer from limitations derived from data collection and instrumentation. Here we offer new comparative evidence on the nature of those problems. We show that commonly used self-report measures of digital news consumption are problematic for three reasons: they only pay attention to a small fraction of all available sources; they underestimate audience share; and they distort the relative position of news sites in visibility rankings. Measurement problems, however, also exist in observational studies, especially when mobile access is excluded from data collection. Our analyses quantify the magnitude of these problems, offering unprecedented comparative evidence of online news consumption that spans nine countries and a period of five years. We discuss the implications of our findings for future research on news exposure.","[Gonzalez-Bailon, Sandra] Univ Penn, Annenberg Sch Commun, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Xenos, Michael A.] Univ Wisconsin, Life Sci Commun, Madison, WI USA",University of Pennsylvania; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Gonzalez-Bailon, S (corresponding author), Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",sgonzalezbailon@asc.upenn.edu,,"Xenos, Michael/0000-0002-2604-172X","National Science Foundation [1729412, 2017655]",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),This work has partly benefited from funding from the National Science Foundation (grant numbers: 1729412 and 2017655).,,36,0,0,3,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

However, no study has examined whether the valence of social media comment fields can trigger similar effects for news engagement on Facebook. In this mixed-methods study, we combine eye tracking with surveys, and conduct an experiment in which participants (n = 96) were exposed to 20 Facebook news posts from the Swedish tabloid Aftonbladet. Under each post, we presented participants with a pair of real (but anonymized) Facebook comments that were either in agreement or disagreement with one another. We then examined how this manipulation influenced participants' visual attention to comment fields, their self-reported likelihood to click on the post to read the full story, and their self-reported likelihood to share the news post to their Facebook network. Our results show that comments in disagreement increased users' visual attention to comments, decreased their likelihood to share the post, and had no effect on their likelihood to read the news article associated with the post. Thus, the presence of disagreement in comments does cue news engagement on Facebook, but the effect is not uniform across different news engagement behaviors. Moreover, engagement with hard versus soft news topics also varied. Disagreement in comments to Facebook posts about soft news topics (Entertainment, Society, and Sports) increased users' attention to the comments field. In contrast, comment disagreement for hard news topics (Economy and Politics) reduced users' attention to the comment field, as well as their self-reported likelihood to read the post.","[Segesten, Anamaria Dutceac; Bossetta, Michael; Holmberg, Nils; Niehorster, Diederick] Lund Univ, Lund, Sweden",Lund University,"Segesten, AD (corresponding author), Lund Univ, 0Ctr Languages & Literature, Helgonabacken 12, S-22100 Lund, Sweden.",anamaria.dutceac_segesten@eu.lu.se,"Holmberg, Nils/B-8775-2016; Niehorster, Diederick Christian/E-9325-2010","Holmberg, Nils/0000-0003-2139-6414; Niehorster, Diederick Christian/0000-0002-4672-8756; Bossetta, Michael/0000-0002-8611-5487; Dutceac Segesten, Anamaria/0000-0001-7058-2040",,,,,45,1,1,4,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Spotify is often called the 'new radio' for the influence it has on breaking songs and artists, and for the role it plays in music discovery and consumption. Our purpose is to determine whether Spotify is leveling the playing field or entrenching hierarchies between major labels and independent labels. We attempt to answer this question through a longitudinal analysis of content owners (major labels or 'indies') and formats (albums, tracks, or playlists) promoted by Spotify through its global Twitter account: @Spotify. As a carefully curated venue for corporate speech @Spotify provides a window into continuities and changes in Spotify's corporate strategy. By using @Spotify as a proxy through which to track patterns of promotion between the years 2012 and 2018, this paper offers a novel empirical examination of how Spotify is shaping the consumption of music, and in turn the structure of the recording industry.

Drawing on interview and focus group data collected from 70 sex crime investigators from police service organizations across Canada, we uncover police perspectives on online sex-based crime. We demonstrate that police perceive online crimes to not necessarily be new forms of crime, but rather altered by digital media in terms of methods and weapons being used. We focus on uncovering the features and affordances police identify as contributing to the increase in crime itself as well as the creation of greater opportunities for crime to occur. In addition, resulting from crime shifting into digital spaces, we uncover the challenges digital media has presented for police in terms of how they handle, respond to, and investigate online crime.

By examining the intersections between social media and the operations of independent Chinese coffeehouses in the field of taste, this paper puts forward the idea of new taste among Chinese millennials, which comprises individual subjectivity, heterogeneous social relationships, and forms of class distinction. Using taste-oriented keyword searches on WeChat official accounts, 20 articles were returned and analyzed in terms of their textural and visual orientations to examine the processes underlying how taste is influenced in the consumption of specialty coffee in China. Findings suggest the importance of taste makers in this process, from routine creation of aesthetic ambience in the coffeehouses to the construction of affective taste spaces online, and the establishment of taste cycles from online to offline, which all underpin class privilege. Moreover, the emergence of an 'urban cafe community' appears to be characterized by specific forms of belonging resulting from a productive effect of the interplay between independent coffeehouses and consumers in everyday urban life in which a set of aesthetic boundaries reside. Second, these digital consumers distinguish themselves socially by positioning themselves as having a cosmopolitan taste grounded in coffee appreciation instead of merely consuming coffee for physiological benefits. These findings extend taste propositions through engagement of Chinese digital millennial consumers to uncover the underlying cultural classifications.","[Xu, Xinyue] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Journalism & Commun, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Ng, Aaron Yikai] Singapore Inst Technol, Singapore, Singapore",Tsinghua University; Singapore Institute of Technology,"Xu, XY (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Sch Journalism & Commun, Beijing, Peoples R China.",xuxy21@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn,,"Ng, Aaron Yi Kai/0000-0002-8349-5816; Xu, Xinyue/0000-0003-2148-9573",,,,,36,0,0,15,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

However, progress is slow, despite important advances in moving beyond a focus on 'digital access' (as measured by network coverage and hardware) towards a more holistic understanding of inclusion that considers abilities, awareness and agency. Here, we propose a further theoretical shift that draws on social system theories (e.g., Luhmann, 1984) and on the theory of 'intersecting inequalities' (Kabeer, 2010). We propose to understand the gender digital gap, particularly in mobile and internet usage, not merely descriptively but dynamically - since even factors like agency and awareness change over time - by applying concepts of feedback loops, low-equilibrium traps, multi-dimensional exclusion and systems analysis. This paper highlights how women may become locked in a state of low-inclusion unless the feedback loops between digital, social, economic and political exclusion are addressed through policies that tackle multiple dimensions. The paper reviews research on gender digital gaps with particular focus on developing countries, and with direct implications for policy-making.","[David, Raluca; Phillips, Toby] Univ Oxford, Blavatnik Sch Govt, 120 Walton St, Oxford OX2 6GG, England",University of Oxford,"David, R (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Blavatnik Sch Govt, 120 Walton St, Oxford OX2 6GG, England.",raluca.florina.david@gmail.com,,,Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCDO) of the United Kingdom,Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCDO) of the United Kingdom,This work was supported by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCDO) of the United Kingdom.,,60,0,0,23,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

What are the everyday practices and cultural logics upon which these inequalities are built? This paper addresses these questions by using a mixed-methods study of 59 group interviews and 268 surveys with adolescents aged 13-15 in Mumbai. Taking an intersectional analytical framework, the findings show how gender and class together create varying standards of 'respectable femininity' and class distinction that families aspire to and cultivate in adolescent girls. The mobile phone can be seen as both a threat and a necessity to the maintenance of these standards of respectability, resulting in families variously enabling or constraining access to mobile phones by girls. Rather than interpreting the findings through binaries of low-income/high-income or empowered/constrained, I instead consider how classed ideals of 'respectable femininity' create different aspirational conditions for girls belonging to each class group, and form the cultural frames of everyday life.","[Bhallamudi, Isha] UC Irvine, Dept Sociol, Irvine, CA 92697 USA",University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Bhallamudi, I (corresponding author), UC Irvine, Dept Sociol, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",isha.b@uci.edu,,"Bhallamudi, Isha/0000-0002-5487-8308",,,,,38,0,0,10,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

As most social media users share articles solely relying on the headline, this raises the question of how emerging digital media reporting - especially in the headlines - shapes the perception of climate change issues and engages audiences. Guided by the dual-systems emotion model and discrete-emotions model, this study compared emotion words used in headlines versus full text among climate change articles and their social media engagement, using computational methods. Findings suggested that climate change support headlines were more likely to use fear words while denial headlines were significantly more likely to contain emotion words, negatively-valenced words, as well as words for anger, anticipation, disgust, sadness, and surprise. Regarding the full text, denial articles were more likely to contain emotion words, negatively-valenced words, and many discrete emotions related words than support articles. A denial article's engagement was predicted by the total number of emotion words contained in its headline, whereas a support article's engagement was predicted by negatively-valenced words and words for fear used in its headline. Emotions contained in the full text did not predict support and -denial articles' engagement. Findings provide practical guidance on how to increase the engagement level of climate change articles.","[Xu, Zhan; Ellis, Lauren] No Arizona Univ, Sch Commun, 700 S Knoles Dr, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Laffidy, Mary] Univ Illinois, Dept Commun, Champaign, IL USA",Northern Arizona University; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Xu, Z (corresponding author), No Arizona Univ, Sch Commun, 700 S Knoles Dr, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA.",zhan.xu@nau.edu,,"Xu, Zhan/0000-0002-6140-6421",Professional Development Funds at Northern Arizona University,Professional Development Funds at Northern Arizona University,This work was supported by Professional Development Funds at Northern Arizona University.,,72,1,1,5,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

This Special Issue of Information, Communication and Society draws together cutting-edge contributions on three core themes in scholarly and policy discourse on platform regulation: First, the papers in this special issue enhance empirical understandings of the role of the state in governing social media platforms developing in the United States, Europe, and Sub-Saharan Africa. Second, they provide a holistic framework to understand policy problems that need to be addressed, which helps to develop and evaluate new policy initiatives.

As such, the goal of this article is to validate the actual effectiveness of Instawareness and to demonstrate how people can be made aware of the Instagram curation algorithm using a quasi-experiment. Validating the actual effectiveness of Instawareness allowed us to connect additional findings about the influence of awareness and understanding of Instagram's curation algorithm to our primary validated findings about achieving such awareness. These show that it is not cognitive understanding about Instagram's algorithms but solely awareness about them that appears to be sufficient for people to indicate increased critical concerns towards SNSs.

Institutional analysis of medical crowdfunding in the United States,INFORMATION COMMUNICATION & SOCIETY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Medical crowdfunding; charitable crowdfunding; donation crowdfunding; institutions; safety net,,"Crowdfunding is becoming a popular way of financing healthcare. Some commentators suggest that crowdfunding could serve as a new institution that fills gaps in conventional safety nets. Others suggest that crowdfunding is simply another way of obtaining help from family, friends, and local associations, and has little transformative potential. We provide one of the first quantitative analyses of medical crowdfunding, and the first to model the broader societal context in which campaigns are situated. We scraped data on US medical campaigns from the leading platform and combined them with county-level socioeconomic data, to model predictors of campaign frequency and success. Our findings suggest that many seek help from crowdfunding when both formal and informal conventional safety nets fail them. Significantly more campaigns are initiated in US counties with poorer private insurance coverage, lower social security provision, fewer social associations, and weaker cultures of giving. However, few campaigns reach their goals where most needed. More successful campaigns are found in counties that are wealthier and healthier and have more social associations. Crowdfunding is not merely 'friendfunding': fundraisers can increase their chances of success by having their appeals widely shared on social media. However, the returns to sharing are greater for campaigns initiated in wealthier areas. Overall, our findings suggest that medical crowdfunding is an entrepreneurial safety net: one where protection is not afforded universally or on the basis of need, but on the basis of one's ability to appeal to the audience and out-compete rivalling needfuls.","[Lee, Sumin; Lehdonvirta, Vili] Univ Oxford, Oxford Internet Inst, Oxford, England",University of Oxford,"Lee, S (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Oxford Internet Inst, Oxford, England.",sumin.lee@oii.ox.ac.uk,,"Lehdonvirta, Vili/0000-0002-6509-1703",,,,,71,8,8,3,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

This study examines the use and consequences of visual-based 'new media' platforms by applying the Narrative Policy Framework (NPF) to the case of DAPL. The NPF focuses our attention on the role of policy stories, acknowledging that narratives have impacts on policy beliefs and actions. I compare social media messaging that includes imagery to that which does not, exploring creation of policy narratives as defined through the NPF. I do so by drawing on a dataset of more than 580 Twitter posts by five environmental advocacy groups from July 2016 through October 2017. My findings speak to the ways in which images and accompanying text interact to form more robust narratives. Visual tweets are also more likely to stimulate greater sharing behavior.

The discussion in this paper is drawn from 32 semi-structured interviews conducted during the fall and winter of 2020 with refugee women from Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Eritrea, Ghana, Syria, and Turkey. The study findings reveal that once all public life either closed or transferred online, refugee women and their families could no longer participate in everyday life or continue their education. The study established that the lack of internet access and hardware at refugee accommodations exacerbated pre-existing social inequalities, turning them into digital isolation and social exclusion. At the same time, the study found that when instant knowledge becomes pivotal in the fight against coronavirus, the lack of access to adequate information for refugees fosters distrust in measures taken to overcome the pandemic and appears to provide fertile ground for misinformation.","[Berg, Miriam] Northwestern Univ Qatar, Journalism & Strateg Commun Program, Doha, Qatar",,"Berg, M (corresponding author), Northwestern Univ Qatar, POB 34102, Doha, Qatar.",m-berg@northwestern.edu,,,Qatar National Library,Qatar National Library(Qatar National Research Fund (QNRF)),Open Access funding provided by the Qatar National Library.,,107,0,0,2,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Through a case study analysis of social media veterinarians on Instagram, I show how calibrated expertise is discursively performed, and knowledge influencers emerge, at a cultural moment in which neoliberalism continues to blur the lines between work and play, and populist backlashes against experts are ubiquitous. By navigating micro-celebrity, authenticity, and relatability, knowledge influencers put a human face and contemporary cultural spin on expertise.

To understand how these imaginaries are spatially shaped and locally defined, we carried out in-depth qualitative research with fifty filmmakers in four regions of Ghana. Digital and platform technologies have long been optimistically celebrated as a way for marginalized creative entrepreneurs, particularly in Africa, to break into global markets and reach unprecedented levels of business success. However, far from being universally adopted by African creative entrepreneurs, these global techno-optimistic imaginaries are continually reworked, contested and subverted in practice. In this article, we show how Ghanaian filmmakers mobilized, deployed and resisted imaginaries of platform entrepreneurship in their efforts to make sense of their situated entrepreneurial practices and to imagine the future of their creative businesses. We found that rather than naively adhering to techno-optimist imaginaries, through their practices, Ghanaian filmmaking entrepreneurs challenged the power geometry of the current platform ecosystem dominated by major Silicon Valley players. We contribute empirically rich data on how filmmaking entrepreneurs use and imagine platform technologies, as is necessary when African digital entrepreneurs are surrounded by hype but inadequate data. We also contribute to the literature about how individual platforms and platform types have unique affordances and how these affordances are shaped by the location and socio-economic position of the entrepreneur.","[Steedman, Robin; Alacovska, Ana; Langevang, Thilde] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Management Soc & Commun, 15 Dalgas Have, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark; [Resario, Rashida] Univ Ghana, Coll Humanities, Sch Performing Arts, Dept Theatre Arts, Legon, Ghana",Copenhagen Business School; University of Ghana,"Alacovska, A (corresponding author), Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Management Soc & Commun, 15 Dalgas Have, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark.",aa.msc@cbs.dk,,,Danida Fellowship Centre [8-05-CB],Danida Fellowship Centre,This work was supported by Danida Fellowship Centre: [Grant Number 8-05-CB].,,56,0,0,7,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Facial recognition technology is one of the most socially contentious emerging technologies of recent years, heavily criticised for enabling racialized and other forms of social harms. Drawing on data gathered through facial recognition tradeshow ethnographies, and interviews with members of the biometrics industry, we explore how the biometric monitoring of children has gained a prominent place in the industry's promotion of facial recognition technology as a mode of 'careful' surveillance. At the same time, however, the fast-changing face of the growing child is acknowledged as a difficult technical challenge to the efficient development and use of this technology. We argue that in these industry discourses the child is figured as both innocent and recalcitrant, and that the facial recognition industry has productively exploited the tension between these two figurations to legitimate and expand its own enterprise.","[O'Neill, Christopher; Selwyn, Neil; Andrejevic, Mark; Gu, Xin] Monash Univ, Sch Media Film & Journalism, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Smith, Gavin] Australian Natl Univ, Sch Sociol, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Monash University; Australian National University,"O'Neill, C (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Sch Media Film & Journalism, Bldg B,Room B3-20,Caulfield Campus, Caulfield, Vic 3145, Australia.",chris.oneill@monash.edu; neil.selwyn@monash.edu; gavin.smith@anu.edu.au; mark.andrejevic@monash.edu; xin.gu@monash.edu,,"Selwyn, Neil/0000-0001-9489-2692; Smith, Gavin/0000-0002-0664-3694",Australian Research Council [DP200100189],Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),The research in this paper was supported by funding from the Australian Research Council [grant number DP200100189].,,53,0,0,2,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Engineers of AI systems are increasingly expected to go beyond the traditions of requirement specifications, taking into account broader societal contexts and their complexities. In this paper we present findings from a hackathon event conducted with working engineers, exploring the gaps between existing guidelines and recommendations for addressing ethical issues with respect to AI technologies and the realities experienced by the engineers in practice. We found that when faced with the uncertainties of how to recognize and navigate ethical issues and challenges, engineers looked to identify the responsibilities that need to be in place to sustain trust and to hold the relevant parties to account for their misdeeds. We re-envision familiar engineering practices as nodes of certainty to accommodate the needs of responsible and ethical AI. Despite the desire for mechanisms for sustaining certainty in how to build AI technology responsibly by providing frameworks for action and accountability, there remains a need to ensure just enough spaces and opportunities to cultivate reasonable doubt. Space and capacity to doubt accepted certainties, in fact, is the very process of ethics, necessary for holding to account our standards, guidelines, and checklists as technology and society co-evolve.","[Shklovski, Irina; Nemethy, Carolina] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Comp Sci, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Nemethy, Carolina] Arctic Univ Norway, Dept Social Sci, Tromso, Norway",University of Copenhagen; UiT The Arctic University of Tromso,"Shklovski, I (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Dept Comp Sci, Copenhagen, Denmark.",ias@di.ku.dk,,,Association of Nordic Engineers; IEEE,Association of Nordic Engineers; IEEE,"This work was funded by the Association of Nordic Engineers with support from IEEE, and the Data-Ethics ThinkDo Tank.",,32,0,0,5,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Can data justice be realised in settings of acute resource injustice? These are the overarching questions that our case study interrogates by opening up the black box of the community in the volatile and fast-transforming peri-urban fringe of Hyderabad, India. We examine the unfolding of data and information processes through the lens of enumeration and community mapping exercises conducted in a low-income neighbourhood. We argue that the realisation of data justice is mediated by 'information politics', i.e., the ways in which informational resources, as well as the risks and rewards associated with them, are distributed across individual actors and identity groups within the community. The democratising potential of emerging digital technologies is severely constrained by structural inequities across gender, caste, class, and even linguistic lines. Our case study underlines the importance of such a structural understanding of data justice and also suggests directions for embedding justice in data processes. Our findings reveal an arena of stark informational disparities between vulnerable, indigent populations and the increasingly sophisticated digital data apparatuses used to encode them. Efforts to promote data justice must take explicit cognisance of these disparities and fragmentation and recognise the internal structural differentiation of vulnerable communities. We argue for an explicit mapping of the information flows and associated information politics that characterise such settings.","[Kennedy, Loraine] EHESS, CNRS CEIAS, Paris, France; [Sood, Ashima] Anant Natl Univ, Ahmadabad, Gujarat, India",,"Kennedy, L (corresponding author), EHESS, CNRS CEIAS, Paris, France.",kennedy@ehess.fr,"Sood, Ashima/AAL-5829-2021; Sood, Ashima/HCI-3573-2022","Sood, Ashima/0000-0003-1036-7589; Chitta, Ram Mohan/0000-0001-6459-1346","University of Manchester's Sustainable Consumption Institute, Canada's International Development Research Centre and France's Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique","University of Manchester's Sustainable Consumption Institute, Canada's International Development Research Centre and France's Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique","This work was supported by University of Manchester's Sustainable Consumption Institute, Canada's International Development Research Centre and France's Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique: [Grant Number NA].",,43,2,2,1,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

In order to delve deeper into some of the main aspects pointed out by students, 77 in-depth interviews were conducted with teachers from all over Spain. The main results highlight that high school students are mainly informed through social networks, television, and their family or friendship groups; that they have difficulties in discriminating between information and opinion; and that, although they consider themselves capable of differentiating between news and hoaxes, more than half are unable to distinguish between fake and real news.

On the other hand, the competences for democratic culture defined by the Council of Europe provide the basis for the elaboration of a theoretical framework that includes the imagination of democratic and sustainable futures as one of its main conceptual axes. Given this theoretical context, this study analyses official documents of public policies carried out in the Iberian context, to examine the treatment of the idea of future in education systems. Specifically, three levels of public policies have been studied: state educational laws, primary education curricula and institutional teacher training policies. The public policies have been analysed using the normative method of content analysis, with a syntactic sampling strategy, calculating the absolute and relative frequency of the units of analysis. Results show that there are few references to the construction of the concept of the future in public policies and suggest that the opportunity to educate others on the imagination of desirable futures may be being wasted.","[Casadella, Marina; Massip-Sabater, Mariona; Gonzalez-Monfort, Neus] Autonomous Univ Barcelona, Dept Language & Literature Educ & Social Sci Educ, Barcelona, Spain; [Dias-Gomes, Alfredo; Barroso-Hortas, Maria-Joao] Polytech Inst Lisbon, Lisbon, Portugal",Autonomous University of Barcelona; Polytechnic Institute of Lisbon,"Casadella, M (corresponding author), Autonomous Univ Barcelona, Dept Language & Literature Educ & Social Sci Educ, Barcelona, Spain.",,"; Gonzalez-Monfort, Neus/B-9519-2009","G Dias, Alfredo/0000-0001-6500-844X; Barroso Hortas, Maria Joao/0000-0002-3159-8362; Casadella, Marina/0000-0001-7003-0019; Gonzalez-Monfort, Neus/0000-0001-8597-0994",,,,,54,0,0,3,3,GRUPO COMUNICAR,HUELVA,"APDO CORREOS 527, HUELVA, 21080, SPAIN",1134-3478,1988-3293,,COMUNICAR,Comunicar,OCT,2022,30,73,,,,,,,113759,10.3916/C73-2022-05,0,,,10,Communication; Education & Educational Research,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication; Education & Educational Research,2L7DT,,"Green Submitted, Green Accepted, gold",,,44885,WOS:000817179000005,0

A questionnaire (with validity and reliability criteria) with a Likert-type scale was applied to 2,215 professors selected from five international scientific events. The main results show that 78% of the professors have less than 15 years of teaching experience, with ages under 44 years of age and 38.9% of them with an undergraduate academic level, 62.5% of whom responded that they have never published in indexed journals, and that they do not know the proper application of paradigms and research designs. On the other hand, 23.86% of the total citations are self-citations. Therefore, the results reflect a significant relationship between the research culture of professors and Latin American scientific production. Finally, Latin American professors have found themselves in economic, political and social circumstances that affect good research and scientific publication practices, leaving a training gap in research competencies in the new digital era.","[Gonzalez-Diaz, Romel] Ctr Int Invest & Desarrollo CIID, Monteria, Colombia; [Acevedo-Duque, Angel] Univ Autonoma Chile, Fac Adm & Negocios, Observ Polit Publ, Providencia, Chile; [Martin-Fiorino, Victor] Univ El Bosque, Fac Ingn, Bogota, Colombia; [Cachicatari-Vargas, Elena] Univ Nacl Jorge Basadre Grehmann, Fac Ciencias Salud, Tacna, Peru",Universidad Autonoma de Chile; Universidad El Bosque,"Gonzalez-Diaz, R (corresponding author), Ctr Int Invest & Desarrollo CIID, Monteria, Colombia.",director@ciid.com.co; angel.acevedo@uautonoma.cl; vrmartin@ucatolica.edu.co; ecachicatariv@unjbg.edu.pe,"Acevedo-Duque, Ángel/ABF-9101-2020; Acevedo-Duque, Angel/G-5384-2015","Acevedo-Duque, Angel/0000-0002-8774-3282; Cachicatari Vargas, Elena/0000-0002-9843-432X",,,,,48,6,6,3,8,GRUPO COMUNICAR,HUELVA,"APDO CORREOS 527, HUELVA, 21080, SPAIN",1134-3478,1988-3293,,COMUNICAR,Comunicar,JAN,2022,30,70,,,,,69,83,,10.3916/C70-2022-06,0,,,13,Communication; Education & Educational Research,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication; Education & Educational Research,XF7DJ,,"Green Submitted, Green Accepted, gold",,,44885,WOS:000724228000006,0

In these environments, different social and political actors contribute to extreme their positions, using bots to create spaces for social distancing where hate speech and incivility have a place, a phenomenon that worries scientists and experts. The main objective of this research is to analyze the role that these automated agents played in the debate on social networks about the Spanish Government's management of the global COVID-19 pandemic. For this, Social Big Data Analysis techniques were applied: machine learning algorithms to know the positioning of users; bot detection algorithms; topic modeling techniques to learn about the topics of the debate on the web, and sentiment analysis. We used a database comprised of Twitter messages published during the confinement, as a result of the Spanish state of alarm. The main conclusion is that the bots could have served to design a political propaganda campaign initiated by traditional actors with the aim of increasing tension in an environment of social emergency. It is argued that, although these agents are not the only actors that increase polarization, they do contribute to deepening the debate on certain key issues, increasing negativity.","[Robles, Jose-Manuel; Guevara, Juan-Antonio; Casas-Mas, Belen] Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Sociol Aplicada, Madrid, Spain; [Gomez, Daniel] Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Estadist & Ciencia Datos, Madrid, Spain",Complutense University of Madrid; Complutense University of Madrid,"Robles, JM (corresponding author), Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Sociol Aplicada, Madrid, Spain.",,"Gomez, Daniel/G-1586-2010; Guevara, Juan Antonio/H-4738-2017","Gomez, Daniel/0000-0001-9548-5781; Guevara, Juan Antonio/0000-0003-3946-3910; Robles, Jose Manuel/0000-0003-1092-3864; Casas-Mas, Belen/0000-0001-8329-0856",,,,,49,0,0,17,33,GRUPO COMUNICAR,HUELVA,"APDO CORREOS 527, HUELVA, 21080, SPAIN",1134-3478,1988-3293,,COMUNICAR,Comunicar,APR,2022,30,71,,,,,,,,10.3916/C71-2022-05,0,,,12,Communication; Education & Educational Research,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication; Education & Educational Research,YO1WE,,"Green Accepted, Green Submitted, gold",,,44885,WOS:000747736200005,0

This study describes how university students over 18 years of age mobilize cognitive and metacognitive learning strategies through digital games. The research methodology used was ex post facto with a quantitative approach. 941 students from 22 States and from the Federal District, enrolled in higher education courses at Brazilian colleges and universities, participated in this research. Data collection occurred through the application of an online questionnaire that integrates the Metacognitive Awareness Inventory (MAI) and the Inventory of Cognitive and Metacognitive Strategies with Digital Games (ICMSDG). The results indicated that university students make regular use of metacognitive knowledge, skills, and strategies. Moreover, cognitive and metacognitive learning strategies seem to be more mobilized by digital game players than by non-players, particularly among those who played over a longer period of time (9 years or more) and with higher intensity (playing every day). With the results found and analyzed, we observe that this study is relevant for both university professors and game designers who aim to promote metacognition skils.","[Cavalcante-Pimentel, Fernando-Silvio] Univ Fed Alagoas, Ctr Educ, Maceio, Alagoas, Brazil; [Morais-Marques, Margarida] Univ Aveiro, Dept Educ & Psychol, CIDTFF Res Ctr Didact & Technol Educ Trainers, Aveiro, Portugal; [Barbosa-de-Sales-Junior, Valdick] Fac City Maceio, Maceio, Alagoas, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Alagoas; Universidade de Aveiro; Centro Investigacao Didatica Tecnologia Formacao Formadores (CIDTFF),"Cavalcante-Pimentel, FS (corresponding author), Univ Fed Alagoas, Ctr Educ, Maceio, Alagoas, Brazil.",,"Marques, Margarida M./A-1025-2011; Pimentel, Fernando/P-1602-2017","Marques, Margarida M./0000-0002-4325-9122; Pimentel, Fernando/0000-0002-9180-8691; Sales, Valdick/0000-0002-0361-4513",,,,,39,0,0,7,7,GRUPO COMUNICAR,HUELVA,"APDO CORREOS 527, HUELVA, 21080, SPAIN",1134-3478,1988-3293,,COMUNICAR,Comunicar,OCT,2022,30,73,,,,,,,113661,10.3916/C73-2022-07,0,,,10,Communication; Education & Educational Research,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication; Education & Educational Research,2L7DT,,"Green Accepted, gold",,,44885,WOS:000817179000007,0

Even though the use of emoticons in formal writing is considered inappropriate and unprofessional, more and more students are using these nonverbal communication tools to add context or emphasis to their email messages to professors. This paper examines the association between the use of emoticons and professors' perceptions of higher education students' email messages with and without emoticons in two countries, Serbia and Slovenia. The students' emails were collected and assessed on several levels. The students' messages were examined with particular attention to the appropriateness of the students' writing style. In addition, the students' level of digital literacy, their attitude toward a professor, and gender differences in the use of emoticons were examined. Furthermore, an online questionnaire was used to identify characteristic differences between students who use emoticons and students who do not. The results show that messages with emoticons are rated lower on several dimensions than messages without emoticons. In addition, students who use emoticons show lower digital literacy and perceive their professors as more understanding and helpful. Emoticon use is not related to gender. The results suggest that students should avoid using emoticons even if they have a positive attitude toward their professor.","[Baggia, Alenka; Znidarsic, Anja; Tratnik, Alenka] Univ Maribor, Fac Org Sci, Maribor, Slovenia",University of Maribor,"Baggia, A (corresponding author), Univ Maribor, Fac Org Sci, Maribor, Slovenia.",,,"Baggia, Alenka/0000-0002-7137-6502; Znidarsic, Anja/0000-0003-0084-3182",,,,,59,0,0,15,15,GRUPO COMUNICAR,HUELVA,"APDO CORREOS 527, HUELVA, 21080, SPAIN",1134-3478,1988-3293,,COMUNICAR,Comunicar,OCT,2022,30,73,,,,,,,113694,10.3916/C73-2022-10,0,,,14,Communication; Education & Educational Research,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication; Education & Educational Research,2L7DT,,"gold, Green Accepted",,,44885,WOS:000817179000010,0

The study capitalises on a diachronic corpus of user-tagged COVID-19 mask memes (posted online from January 2020 to January 2021) collected from Google through a Python script. Based on a grounded-theory approach, ten memetic categories (clustered into four groups) are extracted and examined through a multimodal discourse analytic lens. The diachronic quantitative analysis shows that the memetic constructs, inspired by the current socio-political situation/events and facilitated by the socio-political context (e.g. going into lockdown), seem to persist, albeit with varied intensity, for the best part of the year, with many individual memes going viral. Memes' and memetic constructs' long lifespan is indicative of users' primary goal, which is to share interesting and/or humorous (not always newly minted or relevant) items for the sake of fun, regardless of the memes' nature (i.e. autotelic humour for its own sake or users' commentaries on the surrounding reality).","[Dynel, Marta] Univ Tecn Vilnius Gediminas, Dept Comunicac Creat, Vilnius, Lithuania",,"Dynel, M (corresponding author), Univ Tecn Vilnius Gediminas, Dept Comunicac Creat, Vilnius, Lithuania.",,"Dynel, Marta/O-6261-2018","Dynel, Marta/0000-0003-4647-946X",,,,,26,0,0,9,9,GRUPO COMUNICAR,HUELVA,"APDO CORREOS 527, HUELVA, 21080, SPAIN",1134-3478,1988-3293,,COMUNICAR,Comunicar,JUL,2022,30,72,,,,,,,,10.3916/C72-2022-06,0,,,13,Communication; Education & Educational Research,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication; Education & Educational Research,1D8NN,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,44885,WOS:000794053600006,0

This is also combined with the semi-structured interview technique to identify the discourse of media professionals and the heads of specialised non-governmental organisations in relation to their assessment of the news production on trafficking in Spain. There is lack of information on trafficking of human beings, partly due to the lack of media resources to inform and investigate. The trafficking of human beings for the purpose of sexual exploitation continues to dominate media coverage. Addressing the trafficking of human beings from a holistic and human rights approach, including the visibility of all forms of trafficking, as well as deepening collaboration and cooperation between the media and specialised entities, are tasks of vital importance for further progress.","[Cabrera-Rodriguez, Elvira-Carmen; Antolinez-Merchan, Pilar] Univ Camilo Jose Cela, Dept Criminol, Madrid, Spain",Camilo Jose Cela University,"Cabrera-Rodriguez, EC (corresponding author), Univ Camilo Jose Cela, Dept Criminol, Madrid, Spain.",,"Antolinez-Merchan, Pilar/AAB-1635-2019","Antolinez-Merchan, Pilar/0000-0002-9480-8902; Cabrera Rodriguez, Elvira Carmen/0000-0003-0899-9747",,,,,46,0,0,7,7,GRUPO COMUNICAR,HUELVA,"APDO CORREOS 527, HUELVA, 21080, SPAIN",1134-3478,1988-3293,,COMUNICAR,Comunicar,OCT,2022,30,73,,,,,,,113716,10.3916/C73-2022-09,0,,,11,Communication; Education & Educational Research,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication; Education & Educational Research,2L7DT,,"Green Accepted, gold",,,44885,WOS:000817179000009,0

Thus, students' perceptions of teacher credibility are affected by what instructors post on their social media profiles. The participants in the study were 166 students from the Faculty of Education Sciences at the University of Seville, carried out using a quasi-experimental methodology for which three Twitter profiles for a university professor were created with professional, social and mixed content. For the analysis of the results, normality and homoscedasticity tests were carried out on the sample to decide which statistical tests to use. The most salient results indicated that students perceived the professional profile as more competent, more caring, and more trustworthy, followed by the mixed profile and, lastly, by the social profile. Positive correlations were also found between students who perceived the university professor as reflected in the professional profile as credible in their academic motivation. The findings and their practical implications for instructors are discussed in terms of how they can incorporate Twitter into their teaching, considering the needs of their students to enhance their learning.","[Froment, Facundo; Garcia-Gonzalez, Alfonso-Javier] Univ Seville, Dept Psicol Social, Seville, Spain; [Cabero, Julio] Univ Seville, Dept Diclact & Org Educ, Seville, Spain",University of Sevilla; University of Sevilla,"Froment, F (corresponding author), Univ Seville, Dept Psicol Social, Seville, Spain.",,"Garcia, Alfonso J./L-7128-2014","Garcia, Alfonso J./0000-0002-0839-162X; Cabero Almenara, Julio/0000-0002-1133-6031; Froment, Facundo/0000-0002-2337-3032",,,,,66,0,0,2,6,GRUPO COMUNICAR,HUELVA,"APDO CORREOS 527, HUELVA, 21080, SPAIN",1134-3478,1988-3293,,COMUNICAR,Comunicar,APR,2022,30,71,,,,,,,,10.3916/C71-2022-10,0,,,12,Communication; Education & Educational Research,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication; Education & Educational Research,YO1WE,,"Green Accepted, gold, Green Submitted",,,44885,WOS:000747736200010,0

It examines how parliamentarians contribute to generating information disorder in the digital public space. Through an exploratory content analysis - a descriptive content analysis of 2,307 messages posted on Twitter accounts of parliamentary spokespeople and representatives of the main list of each political party in the Spanish Lower House of Parliament - we explore disinformation rhetoric. The results allow us to conclude that, while the volume of messages shared by parliamentarians on issues susceptible to disinformation is relatively low (14% of tweets), both the themes of the tweets (COVID-19, sex-based violence, migrants or LGBTI), as well as their tone and argumentative and discursive lines, contribute to generating distrust through institutional criticism or their peers.

From an online questionnaire, the participants (N=300) evaluated the quality observed (minimum, average or excellent) and the problems detected from 12 items published in both conventional and pseudo-media. The comparison of results with the expert group shows that about 60% of the students have difficulties in identifying quality accurately and that this ability is higher in the advanced groups. From a selection of five news items, the participants were only able to successfully report 25.3% of the real mistakes in the texts. The correct identification of these mistakes improves in news related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusions reveal that undergraduates overestimate their ability to detect disinformation, with a self-perception of 3.46 out of 5.

We investigate the presence and absence of futures education in these curriculums, their degree of development regarding futures education, and make a first analysis of the influence of futures education in schools. To do this we identify four dimensions: situate in time, anticipate, imagine alternative futures, and social action. The results show that, while the Australian curriculum explicitly includes education for the future, the Spanish and Chilean curriculum include it only tangentially. In addition, the socio-cultural context of schools and the will of the teaching staff are elements that determine the implementation of futures education in the school context.","[Castellvi, Jordi; Escribano, Carmen] Int Univ La Rioja, Dept Educ, La Rioja, Spain; [Santos, Rodrigo] Univ British Columbia, Dept Curricular Studies, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Merolla, JesCis] Metropolitan Univ Educ Sci, Dept Hist & Geog, Santiago, Chile",Universidad Internacional de La Rioja (UNIR); University of British Columbia; Universidad Metropolitana de Ciencias de la Educacion (UMCE),"Castellvi, J (corresponding author), Int Univ La Rioja, Dept Educ, La Rioja, Spain.",,"; Castellvi Mata, Jordi/R-7770-2018","Marolla-Gajardo, Jesus/0000-0001-6215-0010; Escribano Munoz, Carmen/0000-0001-9372-5331; Santos, Rodrigo/0000-0003-4266-1977; Castellvi Mata, Jordi/0000-0002-6487-5477",,,,,42,0,0,11,11,GRUPO COMUNICAR,HUELVA,"APDO CORREOS 527, HUELVA, 21080, SPAIN",1134-3478,1988-3293,,COMUNICAR,Comunicar,OCT,2022,30,73,,,,,,,113693,10.3916/C73-2022-04,0,,,10,Communication; Education & Educational Research,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication; Education & Educational Research,2L7DT,,"Green Accepted, gold",,,44885,WOS:000817179000004,0

A mixed methodology was employed, combining both quantitative and qualitative tools, within the framework of digital ethnography. Five characteristic cases of campaigns linked to political hate speech were chosen, meeting the four criteria set: Latin American scope with representativeness in terms of breadth and impact, political motivation, more than 100,000 tweets, and massive use of fake accounts. The analysis was performed with T-Hoarder, Gephi and MAXQDA. The conclusions drawn are that these campaigns do not occur spontaneously. Rather, a destabilizing political intention lies behind them, sponsored by organizations with considerable ability to disseminate messages and with extensive funds. The massive presence of false accounts, the repetition of certain spelling errors in identical form and the striking increase in the number of accounts just before campaigns are evidence of the automation of these processes. The constant use of aggressive and disparaging terms associated with hatred triggers extreme polarization and a climate of tension, threatening the building and consolidation of democracy itself. Apart from punitive measures, there is a need to implement educational proposals.","[Diez-Gutierrez, Enrique] Univ Leon, Dept Didact Gen Especif & Teoria Educ, Leon, Spain; [Verdeja, Maria] Univ Oviedo, Dept Ciencias Educ, Oviedo, Spain; [Sarrion-Andaluz, Jose] Univ Pontificia Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain; [Buendia, Luis] Univ Leon, Dept Econ & Estat, Leon, Spain; [Macias-Tovar, Julian] Pandemia Digital, Madrid, Spain",Universidad de Leon; University of Oviedo; Pontifical University of Salamanca; Universidad de Leon,"Diez-Gutierrez, E (corresponding author), Univ Leon, Dept Didact Gen Especif & Teoria Educ, Leon, Spain.",,"VERDEJA MUÑIZ, MARIA/Q-4904-2016; Diez-Gutierrez, Enrique J./K-1416-2014; Buendia, Luis/B-8755-2016","VERDEJA MUÑIZ, MARIA/0000-0003-0499-9248; Diez-Gutierrez, Enrique J./0000-0003-3399-5318; Sarrion-Andaluz, Jose/0000-0001-9110-0549; Buendia, Luis/0000-0002-8507-7538",,,,,54,1,1,6,6,GRUPO COMUNICAR,HUELVA,"APDO CORREOS 527, HUELVA, 21080, SPAIN",1134-3478,1988-3293,,COMUNICAR,Comunicar,JUL,2022,30,72,,,,,,,,10.3916/C72-2022-08,0,,,12,Communication; Education & Educational Research,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication; Education & Educational Research,1D8NN,,"Green Submitted, Green Accepted, gold",,,44885,WOS:000794053600008,0

A questionnaire was used as a data collection instrument based on UNESCO's proposals on ICT (Information and Communication Technologies) and MIL (Media and Information Literacy). A total of 402 teachers and pre-service teachers took part in the questionnaire. This is an exploratory cross-sectional study where quantitative descriptive and correlational methodology is used. Findings reveal that the self-perceived competence of teachers is low and that the self-perceived level is always lower than the importance given to the corresponding competence. Greater importance is assigned to MIL competencies than to ICT competencies of teachers; this questions the tendency to prioritize technological and didactic training over media education training. It concludes with the need for a paradigm shift towards convergence in teacher training policies for the digital age, and a global model of teacher competencies in media and ICT (COMPROMETIC) is proposed that integrates MIL competencies with those of ICT teachers. The model is based on a double convergence: that of different literacies, and that of the resulting multi-literacy with the specific training of education professionals in ICT and media.","[Gutierrez-Martin, Alfonso] Univ Valladolid, Dept Pedag, Segovia, Spain; [Pinedo-Gonzalez, Ruth] Univ Valladolid, Dept Psicol, Segovia, Spain; [Gil-Puente, Cristina] Univ Valladolid, Dept Didact Ciencias Expt Sociales & Matemat, Segovia, Spain",Universidad de Valladolid; Universidad de Valladolid; Universidad de Valladolid,"Gutierrez-Martin, A (corresponding author), Univ Valladolid, Dept Pedag, Segovia, Spain.",alfonso.gutietioz.martin@uva.es; ruth.pinedo@uva.es; cristina.gil.puente@uva.es,"pinedo, ruth/C-8948-2014; Gil, Cristina/D-5613-2016; Gutierrez, Alfonso/D-5528-2016","pinedo, ruth/0000-0002-4699-9433; Gil, Cristina/0000-0001-5794-5564; Gutierrez, Alfonso/0000-0002-2288-9459",,,,,44,4,4,11,40,GRUPO COMUNICAR,HUELVA,"APDO CORREOS 527, HUELVA, 21080, SPAIN",1134-3478,1988-3293,,COMUNICAR,Comunicar,JAN,2022,30,70,,,,,21,33,,10.3916/C70-2022-02,0,,,13,Communication; Education & Educational Research,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication; Education & Educational Research,XF7DJ,,"gold, Green Submitted, Green Accepted",,,44885,WOS:000724228000002,0

It is a global phenomenon that must be studied from different approaches and the educational dimension is one of the most relevant. It is necessary to know what educational models have been developed to empower citizens against disinformation. A systematic review of the literature (2011-2020), following the PRISMA protocol, was carried out by analyzing articles (n=76) extracted from three databases (Wos, Scopus and ERIC). Reference management and text mining software was used to data analyse. Eight research questions were answered on the conceptual framework, bibliometrics characteristics and pedagogical dimension. From the results of the content analysis emerges a vision of the role of multiliteracies in educational research and the problem of disinformation: media and information literacies are the most relevant and news and data literacies are incorporated. The need to adopt interdisciplinary approaches is confirmed. From the results of the educational dimension, three pedagogical approaches are identified: strategies for competencies development; focused on content and education for citizenship. Workshops and lesson plans are the most common teaching practices. The development of critical thinking, experiences in the co-construction of knowledge, and the values of civic education are fundamental against disinformation.","[Valverde-Berrocoso, Jesus; Gonzalez-Fernandez, Alberto; Acevedo-Borrega, Jesus] Univ Extremadura, Dept Ciencias Educ, Caceres, Spain",Universidad de Extremadura,"Valverde-Berrocoso, J (corresponding author), Univ Extremadura, Dept Ciencias Educ, Caceres, Spain.",jevabe@unex.es; albertogf@unex.es; jeacbo@unex.es,"González-Fernández, Alberto/K-6021-2017; Valverde-Berrocoso, Jesús/K-4687-2014; Acevedo-Borrega, Jesús/K-6014-2017","González-Fernández, Alberto/0000-0001-6277-9054; Valverde-Berrocoso, Jesús/0000-0003-2580-4067; Acevedo-Borrega, Jesús/0000-0002-7234-8263",,,,,47,4,4,25,61,GRUPO COMUNICAR,HUELVA,"APDO CORREOS 527, HUELVA, 21080, SPAIN",1134-3478,1988-3293,,COMUNICAR,Comunicar,JAN,2022,30,70,,,,,97,110,,10.3916/C70-2022-08,0,,,14,Communication; Education & Educational Research,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication; Education & Educational Research,XF7DJ,,"Green Accepted, Green Submitted, gold",,,44885,WOS:000724228000008,0

However, many students report fear of speaking in public, the so-called Public Speaking Anxiety (PSA). This study aims to implement a training program using Virtual Reality (VR) with distractors to reduce the college students' anxiety. Anxiety was measured with two methods: electrodermal activity and self-report. We also analyze gender differences. There were an experimental and a control group. Both groups had to deliver the same speech twice: pre-test (before training); and post-test (after the training program) while participants' electrodermal activity was measured. Only the experimental group was trained with VR. Students also completed the Public Speaking Anxiety Scale and a survey to examine their experience. The results showed that the VR training reduced the anxiety levels significantly in the experimental group, but there were no significant differences in the control group. The data also revealed a higher level of anxiety in male than in female students. Finally, participants reported a positive impression of the VR training. These results showed the effectiveness of Virtual Reality software with distractors to reduce public speaking anxiety.","[Rodero, Emma] Univ Pompeu Fabra, UPF Barcelona Sch Management, Barcelona, Spain; [Larrea, Olatz] Univ Barcelona, Fac Filol & Comunicac, Barcelona, Spain",Pompeu Fabra University; University of Barcelona,"Rodero, E (corresponding author), Univ Pompeu Fabra, UPF Barcelona Sch Management, Barcelona, Spain.",,"Rodero, Emma/G-9235-2015","Rodero, Emma/0000-0003-0948-3400; Larrea, Olatz/0000-0002-6194-6401",,,,,41,1,1,12,12,GRUPO COMUNICAR,HUELVA,"APDO CORREOS 527, HUELVA, 21080, SPAIN",1134-3478,1988-3293,,COMUNICAR,Comunicar,JUL,2022,30,72,,,,,,,,10.3916/C72-2022-07,0,,,13,Communication; Education & Educational Research,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication; Education & Educational Research,1D8NN,,"Green Accepted, Green Submitted, gold",,,44885,WOS:000794053600007,0

There are different debates about a potential overrepresentation of some of these exploitation purposes, such as the sexual one, in the discourses underlying international regulations, news or institutional campaigns. This may have consequences on the identification of some of the population affected by this phenomenon and the assistance provided to them. The aim of this paper is to analyse the temporal evolution of the purposes of exploitation, actors and topics most represented in the activity on human trafficking and exploitation on Twitter during the 2011-2020 period. The results show that sexual exploitation is the purpose most represented in Twitter activity and the fact that international organisations and the criminal prosecution of the crime of human trafficking have progressively become more relevant. Furthermore, the networks of topics suggest that sexual exploitation seems to be linked to the notion of prostitution. This may have consequences for the displacement of other purposes of exploitation or the approaches centred on the promotion of human rights to less relevant positions, as well as for the construction of certain images of victims of human trafficking.","[Sierra-Rodriguez, Alba] Univ Granada, Inst Univ Invest Estudios Mujeres & Genero, Granada, Spain; [Arroyo-Machado, Wenceslao] Univ Granada, Dept Informac & Comunicac, Granada, Spain; [Barroso-Hurtado, Domingo] Univ Extremadura, Dept Ciencias Educ, Caceres, Spain",University of Granada; University of Granada; Universidad de Extremadura,"Sierra-Rodriguez, A (corresponding author), Univ Granada, Inst Univ Invest Estudios Mujeres & Genero, Granada, Spain.",,"Barroso-Hurtado, Domingo/ABI-7462-2020; Arroyo-Machado, Wenceslao/AAB-5998-2019","Barroso-Hurtado, Domingo/0000-0001-6482-9860; Arroyo-Machado, Wenceslao/0000-0001-9437-8757; Sierra-Rodriguez, Alba/0000-0003-3016-7963",,,,,47,0,0,3,9,GRUPO COMUNICAR,HUELVA,"APDO CORREOS 527, HUELVA, 21080, SPAIN",1134-3478,1988-3293,,COMUNICAR,Comunicar,APR,2022,30,71,,,,,,,,10.3916/C71-2022-06,0,,,13,Communication; Education & Educational Research,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication; Education & Educational Research,YO1WE,,"Green Published, Green Accepted, Green Submitted, gold",,,44885,WOS:000747736200006,0

To this end, we developed the multidimensional Motivations for Hate Speech Perpetration Scale (MHATE) and evaluated the psychometric properties. We also explored the associations between social norms and adolescents' motivations for hate speech perpetration. The sample consisted of 346 adolescents from Switzerland (54.6% boys; Mage=14; SD=0.96) who reported engagement in hate speech as perpetrators. The analyses revealed good psychometric properties for the MHATE, including good internal consistency. The most frequently endorsed subscale was revenge, followed by ideology, group conformity, status enhancement, exhilaration, and power. The results also showed that descriptive norms and peer pressure were related to a wide range of different motivations for perpetrating hate speech. Injunctive norms, however, were only associated with power. In conclusion, findings indicate that hate speech fulfills various functions. We argue that knowing the specific motivations that underlie hate speech could help us derive individually tailored prevention strategies (e.g., anger management, promoting an inclusive classroom climate). Furthermore, we suggest that practitioners working in the field of hate speech prevention give special attention to social norms surrounding adolescents.","[Wachs, Sebastian] Univ Potsdam, Dept Estudios Educ, Potsdam, Germany; [Wettstein, Alexander] Univ Formac Profesorado Berna, Inst Invest Desarrollo & Evaluac, Bern, Switzerland; [Bilz, Ludwig] Univ Tecnol Brandenburgo Cottbus, Dept Ciencias Salud, Senftenberg, Germany; [Gamez-Guadix, Manuel] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Psicol Biol & Salud, Madrid, Spain",University of Potsdam; Autonomous University of Madrid,"Wachs, S (corresponding author), Univ Potsdam, Dept Estudios Educ, Potsdam, Germany.",,"Gamez-Guadix, Manuel/F-9727-2013","Gamez-Guadix, Manuel/0000-0002-1575-1662; Wachs, Sebastian/0000-0003-2787-6646; Wettstein, Alexander/0000-0002-5612-3144; Bilz, Ludwig/0000-0003-3017-0492",,,,,36,2,2,4,8,GRUPO COMUNICAR,HUELVA,"APDO CORREOS 527, HUELVA, 21080, SPAIN",1134-3478,1988-3293,,COMUNICAR,Comunicar,APR,2022,30,71,,,,,,,,10.3916/C71-2022-01,0,,,12,Communication; Education & Educational Research,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication; Education & Educational Research,YO1WE,,"Green Accepted, Green Submitted, gold",,,44885,WOS:000747736200001,0

Among the mechanisms used to mitigate the effects of the infodemic, critical media literacy has proven a valuable approach. This study aimed to analyze the critical media skills (CMS) of young people and adults in relation to the variables of infodemic awareness (IPA), infodemic and wellbeing (ISW), emotional reaction (ERI), and media trust (MTC). A cross-sectional online study with 404 participants (Mage=32.8) was conducted in two virtual communities in Mexico during the first semester of 2021. Descriptive analysis revealed highly critical media skills in participants. Adults showed high levels of IPA, while young people presented high levels of ISW, ERI, and MTC. Observations by the age group indicated an association between CMS and ISW, and CMS and MCT, while the association between CMS and IPA was null. The COVID-19 outbreak has intensified the consumption of digital media and access to untrustworthy information. Critical media literacy may protect individuals from the risks of infodemic by enhancing critical roles and attitudes toward media discourse. This study supports the recommendation to promote media literacy initiatives that inoculate critical media skills as mechanisms to counteract the misinformation in health crises.","[Sanchez-Reina, J-Roberto] Pompeu Fabra Univ, Dept Informat & Commun Technol, Barcelona, Spain; [Gonzalez-Lara, Ericka-Fernanda] Res & Transfer Ctr Rhizome Networks, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",Pompeu Fabra University,"Sanchez-Reina, JR (corresponding author), Pompeu Fabra Univ, Dept Informat & Commun Technol, Barcelona, Spain.",,"Lara, Ericka/CAF-2102-2022; Sánchez-Reina, J Roberto/AFB-1353-2022","Sanchez-Reina, J.

This paper draws on these interactions to systematically review peer-reviewed articles related to media representations of immigrants and refugees in Brazil and the United Kingdom (UK). The objective was to identify the tone used in such representations and the research methods applied in the articles. This is the first systematic literature review that compares studies on media and immigration including both Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic (WEIRD) and non-WEIRD countries. This paper uses Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) to collect, map, and systematize 47 peer-reviewed articles published in the past two decades. The findings show that, in the studies we analyzed, the tone of representation of refugees in the media in both countries is negative. Mass media underrepresent the main actors and use stereotypes and discourses of otherization. This paper contributes to our understanding of the differences between studies, including those conducted in the UK and Brazil, and calls for more comparative studies that include countries from the global south and global north. It also demonstrates the standardization of frames and tone of representation on immigration in both countries, suggesting similar patterns across different countries.","[Goncalves, Isabella; David, Yossi] Univ Johannes Gutenberg, Dept Comunicac, Maguncia, Germany",Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz,"Goncalves, I (corresponding author), Univ Johannes Gutenberg, Dept Comunicac, Maguncia, Germany.",,"David, Yossi/GWU-4998-2022; Goncalves, Isabella/F-3634-2019","David, Yossi/0000-0001-8020-0317; Goncalves, Isabella/0000-0002-6492-9236",,,,,75,1,1,3,9,GRUPO COMUNICAR,HUELVA,"APDO CORREOS 527, HUELVA, 21080, SPAIN",1134-3478,1988-3293,,COMUNICAR,Comunicar,APR,2022,30,71,,,,,,,,10.3916/C71-2022-04,0,,,13,Communication; Education & Educational Research,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication; Education & Educational Research,YO1WE,,"gold, Green Submitted, Green Accepted",,,44885,WOS:000747736200004,0

The smartphone has established itself as the device with greater versatility and applicability in the academic/personal context of the subjects. For this reason, the following study addresses, from a longitudinal qualitative approach, the knowledge, use, benefits, and difficulties of the pedagogical application of smartphones, as well as the training needs perceived by higher education teachers, understanding the evolution of this trend in the last seven years. The participating sample is made up of 32 lecturers belonging to five Spanish universities, through the realization of six focus groups during the 2014-2015 and 2021-2022 academic years. The main results show that the lecturers value favorably the possibilities of the tool for communication and information search. However, in recent times more skeptical and critical evaluations are perceived, considering that the smartphone has not brought about the expected qualitative leap in the teaching methodologies applied in the classroom. Promoting the critical, responsible, and context-specific use of the mobile device, while effectively applying its technological possibilities in the creation of constructive pedagogical experiences in a temporally and spatially specified manner, may be one of the keys to a harmonious and not overloaded coexistence between academic and life experiences mediated with and without technology.","[Salcines-Talledo, Irina; Gonzalez-Fernandez, Natalia; Diaz-Herrera, Laura] Univ Cantabria, Dept Educ, Santander, Spain; [Area-Moreira, Manuel] Univ La Laguna, Dept Didact & Invest Educ, Tenerife, Spain",Universidad de Cantabria; Universidad de la Laguna,"Salcines-Talledo, I (corresponding author), Univ Cantabria, Dept Educ, Santander, Spain.",,"González-Fernández, Natalia/K-8959-2014; Salcines Talledo, Irina/H-1957-2015; Area-Moreira, Manuel/K-9440-2014","González-Fernández, Natalia/0000-0001-6669-8446; Diaz-Herrera, Laura/0000-0001-5998-5674; Salcines Talledo, Irina/0000-0003-0170-9807; Area-Moreira, Manuel/0000-0003-0358-7663",,,,,56,1,1,2,2,GRUPO COMUNICAR,HUELVA,"APDO CORREOS 527, HUELVA, 21080, SPAIN",1134-3478,1988-3293,,COMUNICAR,Comunicar,JUL,2022,30,72,,,,,,,,10.3916/C72-2022-09,0,,,13,Communication; Education & Educational Research,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication; Education & Educational Research,1D8NN,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,44885,WOS:000794053600009,0

It was observed that the cyber VAWG articles topic trends are increasing with most of the articles focusing on the topics Online sexual exploitation and sexual abuse of children and ICT-related violations of privacy. Text mining methods may address the limitations of traditional qualitative approaches. Understanding the cyber VAWG issues by mining news articles is a novel approach that could help create programs and policies to address this societal concern.

For this purpose, we designed a survey that was administered to 756 young people between 16 and 26 years of age from different educational levels. The results show a profile of creative users who participate in generating their own content and sharing their recommendations openly, as opposed to another profile, the spectators, focused on entertainment and interaction. The creator profile is the variable that most contributes to reporting fake news on social media. When contrasting information, educational level is the most relevant aspect, although academic results and creator users also represent a significant contribution. Greater trust in the sources found on social media identifies the active profile, while distrust is associated with the spectators. We recommend that media education puts in place actions intended to recuperate trust in social media, so that they can be utilized critically, encouraging active, not reactive use.","[Taddeo, Gabriela] Univ Turin, Dept Humanidades, Turin, Italy; [de-Frutos-Torres, Belinda; Alvarado, Maria-Cruz] Univ Valladolid, Dept Comunicac Audiovisual & Publicidad, Segovia, Italy",University of Turin,"Taddeo, G (corresponding author), Univ Turin, Dept Humanidades, Turin, Italy.",,,"Frutos Torres, Belinda de/0000-0002-9391-8835; Taddeo, Gabriella/0000-0002-9544-336X; Alvarado, Maria Cruz/0000-0002-1659-7249",,,,,64,0,0,8,8,GRUPO COMUNICAR,HUELVA,"APDO CORREOS 527, HUELVA, 21080, SPAIN",1134-3478,1988-3293,,COMUNICAR,Comunicar,JUL,2022,30,72,,,,,,,,10.3916/C72-2022-01,0,,,12,Communication; Education & Educational Research,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication; Education & Educational Research,1D8NN,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,44885,WOS:000794053600001,0

The growth of this type of discourse has been supported by the expansion of social media, which have been proven to act as a mechanism for the propagation of crimes against targets such as migrants and refugees, one of the main affected groups. That is why we have conducted the first European study of the social acceptance of migrants and refugees by studying the presence of hate speech. The research is based on the perspective of the theories of intergroup contact and mediated intergroup contact. The methodology includes largescale longitudinal analysis (2015-2020) of online hate speech on Twitter (N=847,978) and its contrast with existing official indicators. The results suggest that personal intergroup contact is positively corretaled with the support of the local population towards migrants and refugees but mediated intergroup contact is not correlated with hate speech on Twitter. We found evidence that those regions where the support for foreigners was higher, there was a lower level of hate speech on Twitter. This is an advance in the study of hate speech by territories and can help in the formulation of action strategies.","[Arcila-Calderon, Carlos; Sanchez-Holgado, Patricia; Quintana-Moreno, Cristina; Amores, Javier-J; Blanco-Herrero, David] Univ Salamanca, Dept Sociol & Comunicac, Salamanca, Spain",University of Salamanca,"Arcila-Calderon, C (corresponding author), Univ Salamanca, Dept Sociol & Comunicac, Salamanca, Spain.",,"Blanco-Herrero, David/Z-4814-2019; Sanchez-Holgado, Patricia/R-1866-2016; Arcila Calderon, Carlos/D-3178-2012; Jimenez Amores, Javier/A-6934-2018","Blanco-Herrero, David/0000-0002-7414-2998; Sanchez-Holgado, Patricia/0000-0002-6253-7087; Arcila Calderon, Carlos/0000-0002-2636-2849; Jimenez Amores, Javier/0000-0001-7856-5392; QUINTANA MORENO, CRISTINA/0000-0001-6303-6332",,,,,38,2,3,6,18,GRUPO COMUNICAR,HUELVA,"APDO CORREOS 527, HUELVA, 21080, SPAIN",1134-3478,1988-3293,,COMUNICAR,Comunicar,APR,2022,30,71,,,,,,,,10.3916/C71-2022-02,0,,,13,Communication; Education & Educational Research,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication; Education & Educational Research,YO1WE,,"gold, Green Accepted, Green Submitted",,,44885,WOS:000747736200002,0

This unprecedented situation has given rise to numerous studies aimed at determining the effects of the changes brought about by this widespread lockdown. One of the important changes was the digitisation of education and, therefore, teaching, which caused a forced and abrupt immersion in distance learning. In this study, a quantitative methodology based on an ex post facto research design was used with the aim of analysing the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on the academic performance of schoolchildren (aged 3-12 years). A total of 529 parents completed an ad hoc questionnaire on the impact of COVID-19 on their children's education in Spain. The results produced a robust model based on structural equations that explain 39.7% of the variance in academic performance at home. The family-school relationship was the variable with the greatest explanatory weight (beta=.505; p<.05). In conclusion, the benefits derived from a strong relationship between families and schools, evidenced by the creation of cooperation and communication links, facilitate the management of shared educational challenges such as on-line education in times of crises.","[Serrano-Diaz, Noemi] Univ Cadiz, Dept Didact Org Escolar, Cadiz, Spain; [Aragon-Mendizabal, Estibaliz] Univ Cadiz, Dept Psicol, Cadiz, Spain; [Merida-Serrano, Rosario] Univ Cordoba, Dept Educ, Cordoba, Spain",Universidad de Cadiz; Universidad de Cadiz; Universidad de Cordoba,"Serrano-Diaz, N (corresponding author), Univ Cadiz, Dept Didact Org Escolar, Cadiz, Spain.",noemi.serrano@uca.es; estivaliz.aragon@uca.es; edlmeser@uco.es,"Aragón, Estíbaliz/AAA-6529-2019; Merida Serrano, Rosario/C-2052-2019","Aragón, Estíbaliz/0000-0002-0440-5705; Merida Serrano, Rosario/0000-0001-9389-3263; Serrano Diaz, Maria Noemi/0000-0003-4543-450X",,,,,39,5,5,7,14,GRUPO COMUNICAR,HUELVA,"APDO CORREOS 527, HUELVA, 21080, SPAIN",1134-3478,1988-3293,,COMUNICAR,Comunicar,JAN,2022,30,70,,,,,59,68,,10.3916/C70-2022-05,0,,,10,Communication; Education & Educational Research,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication; Education & Educational Research,XF7DJ,,"Green Submitted, Green Accepted, gold",,,44885,WOS:000724228000005,0

However, the digital revolution has transformed the ways to encourage reading and learning about books. People who generate and share content about books on social networks are the so-called booktokers, influencers on TikTok who have become an emerging phenomenon in this connected society. However, there is scarce research that studies them in depth. Therefore, it is crucial to explore booktokers to understand them better and to assess why they accept and use technologies to generate and share content about books on TikTok. This paper intends to explore the acceptance and use of TikTok to generate and share content about books on this social network as a booktoker. For this, a qualitative methodology of semi-structured interviews with thirteen Latin American booktokers was used. The analysis was developed through a thematic analysis based on the UTAUT2 theory to explain the findings. The results indicated the categories: performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, hedonic motivation, habit, price value, and a new identified category related to the generation of community and networks.

This work investigates the interaction between the ideology of the source and the audience (progressive vs. conservative) and the type of message (hate vs. non-hate) on cognitions (perception of the veracity of the message and the source) and negative emotion (biometric and self-reported). Biometric emotion was assessed by recording heart rate variability and electrodermal response. The results highlight the importance of evaluating implicit biometric responses that reveal inaccessible data with other methodologies: conservatives show more emotion in their biometric records than in self-reported ones. With these measures, hate desensitization effects are also detected in both audiences. With selfreported measures, more negative emotion is detected in progressive audiences only when the source is contrary to their ideology; on the other hand, conservatives show less negative emotion in all cases.

Recent studies reaffirm engagement as an alternative to reduce dropout rates. The literature analyzed has not yet been able to systematize responses as to how to guarantee engagement in MOOCs and thus reduce their attrition rate. And, consistent with that question, are there still challenges for teachers in this area of educational technology? These answers motivated us to carry out this systematic review to determine how engagement has been studied to help reduce the attrition rate in MOOCs. Articles from journals indexed in Scopus or WoS were reviewed applying the PRISMA protocol. At the end of the protocol, it was defined to analyze 40 studies. The results reflect that the main variables are: the design of e-activities, intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, and communication between students. This paper confirms that the main challenges to guarantee engagement in MOOCs are individualized tutoring, interactivity, and feedback. Due to the scarcity of studies that analyze the variables in an integrated way, it is proposed as future work to determine what relationships exist between these variables that interfere with engagement and dropout in MOOCs.","[Estrada-Molina, Odiel] Univ Ciencias Informat, Dept Docente Informat, Havana, Cuba; [Fuentes-Cancell, Dieter-Reynaldo] Univ Ciencias Informat, Dept Ciencias Sociales, Havana, Cuba",,"Estrada-Molina, O (corresponding author), Univ Ciencias Informat, Dept Docente Informat, Havana, Cuba.",oestiada@uci.cu; dieter@uci.cu,"Molina, Odiel Estrada/X-1014-2019; Cancell, Dieter Fuentes/AAH-9344-2021","Molina, Odiel Estrada/0000-0002-0918-418X; Cancell, Dieter Fuentes/0000-0002-2509-5400",,,,,73,4,4,14,41,GRUPO COMUNICAR,HUELVA,"APDO CORREOS 527, HUELVA, 21080, SPAIN",1134-3478,1988-3293,,COMUNICAR,Comunicar,JAN,2022,30,70,,,,,111,124,,10.3916/C70-2022-09,0,,,14,Communication; Education & Educational Research,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication; Education & Educational Research,XF7DJ,,"Green Accepted, Green Submitted, gold",,,44885,WOS:000724228000009,0

The findings show that the literature included specific educational methodologies, a balance between theoretical and empirical publications, a focus on specialised journals and countries and that multidisciplinarity in education was not common with subjects outside social sciences. Moreover, we found that the predictive approach and negative perspectives were not present. We conclude that futures literacy is a key element to bringing together ideas related to futures studies in education, that futures studies contribute to changing the way of working with and conceptualising the future in education, and that they promote transformative movements.","[Menendez-Alvarez-Hevia, David] Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Sch Childhood Youth & Educ Studies, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Urbina-Ramirez, Santos; Forteza-Forteza, Dolors] Univ Illes Balears, Dept Appl Pedag & Educ Psychol, Palma De Mallorca, Spain; [Rodriguez-Martin, Alejandro] Univ Oviedo, Dept Educ Sci, Oviedo, Spain",Manchester Metropolitan University; Universitat de les Illes Balears; University of Oviedo,"Menendez-Alvarez-Hevia, D (corresponding author), Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Sch Childhood Youth & Educ Studies, Manchester, Lancs, England.",,"Alvarez-Hev, David Menendez/ABE-9326-2020; Forteza Forteza, Dolors/ABG-8050-2020; Urbina, Santos/P-5643-2016","Alvarez-Hev, David Menendez/0000-0003-2138-1490; Forteza Forteza, Dolors/0000-0002-2053-9770; Rodriguez Martin, Alejandro/0000-0002-4230-4243; Urbina, Santos/0000-0003-2184-1303",,,,,55,0,0,6,6,GRUPO COMUNICAR,HUELVA,"APDO CORREOS 527, HUELVA, 21080, SPAIN",1134-3478,1988-3293,,COMUNICAR,Comunicar,OCT,2022,30,73,,,,,,,113780,10.3916/C73-2022-01,0,,,12,Communication; Education & Educational Research,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication; Education & Educational Research,2L7DT,,"Green Accepted, gold",,,44885,WOS:000817179000001,0

Meta-research is necessary because it allows re-evaluating the field and offers new horizons in knowledge production. Two studies were conducted: 1) Bibliometric analysis of 116 journals in eight databases and 24 publications in the Web of Science and Scopus; 2) Content analysis including that of 407 articles over a period of 10 years (2009-2018). The findings demonstrate a research trend in the Latin American region toward international standards, evidenced by a preponderance of empirical over essay studies. Universities in the region published most of the journals in the field and circulation was predominantly biannual. Contrary to expectations, the most widely disseminated topic was health communication, partly owing to a large sample of Brazilian journals. Within the empirical research, the qualitative approach was predominant. The interview was the most widely used research method in the region. Finally, the most used theories were agenda setting and framing. Imminent challenges arise, i.e., to strengthen indigenous theoretical production and to position the region's themes and reflection more decisively in knowledge production at a global level.","[Arroyave-Cabrera, Jesus] Univ Norte, Dept Comunicac, Barranquilla, Colombia; [Gonzalez-Pardo, Rafael] Univ Tolima, Grp Comunicac & Democracia, Ibague, Colombia",Universidad del Norte; Universidad del Tolima,"Arroyave-Cabrera, J (corresponding author), Univ Norte, Dept Comunicac, Barranquilla, Colombia.",jamiyav@uninorte.edu.co; rgonzal@ut.edu.co,"Arroyave, Jesus/K-2042-2015; Gonzalez Pardo, Rafael/L-7680-2016","Arroyave, Jesus/0000-0001-5894-6059; Gonzalez Pardo, Rafael/0000-0002-5781-0456",,,,,51,0,0,2,12,GRUPO COMUNICAR,HUELVA,"APDO CORREOS 527, HUELVA, 21080, SPAIN",1134-3478,1988-3293,,COMUNICAR,Comunicar,JAN,2022,30,70,,,,,85,96,,10.3916/C70-2022-07,0,,,12,Communication; Education & Educational Research,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication; Education & Educational Research,XF7DJ,,"Green Submitted, Green Accepted, gold",,,44885,WOS:000724228000007,0

This research is part of this second group of studies, and attempts to investigate the notions and discourses on disinformation in the case of Spain. For this purpose, seven discussion groups were conducted, with a structural sample constructed according to employment situation, ideology and age. The results show a perception of the communicative ecosystem structured in two chronological poles, which contrasts a past of reduced information supply - associated with traditional media - with a current informational environment where there is more media diversity, but also less trust in them. The groups point to the overabundance of information and associated disinformation with decontextualisation, low-quality journalism and the economic and political interests of different actors. Discourses outline a scenario of decline in journalism and the public sphere, which is perceived as polarised and emotional. Disinformation is therefore perceived as a multidimensional phenomenon that is associated with issues of major democratic transcendence rather than merely sending hoaxes through the Internet.","[Valera-Ordaz, Lidia; Calvo, Dafne; Lopez-Garcia, Guillermo] Univ Valencia, Dept Teoria Lenguajes & Ciencias Comunicac, Valencia, Spain; [Requena-I-Mora, Marina] Univ Jaime I, Dept Filosofia & Sociol, Castellon de La Plana, Spain",University of Valencia; Universitat Jaume I,"Valera-Ordaz, L (corresponding author), Univ Valencia, Dept Teoria Lenguajes & Ciencias Comunicac, Valencia, Spain.",,"Ordaz, Lidia Valera/AAC-3618-2020; Calvo, Dafne/F-7444-2016; Requena Mora, Marina/F-3794-2016","Valera-Ordaz, Lidia/0000-0002-1085-980X; Calvo, Dafne/0000-0003-0659-6792; Lopez, Guillermo/0000-0002-5701-2024; Requena Mora, Marina/0000-0001-5519-3127",,,,,42,1,1,3,3,GRUPO COMUNICAR,HUELVA,"APDO CORREOS 527, HUELVA, 21080, SPAIN",1134-3478,1988-3293,,COMUNICAR,Comunicar,JUL,2022,30,72,,,,,,,,10.3916/C72-2022-02,0,,,12,Communication; Education & Educational Research,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication; Education & Educational Research,1D8NN,,"gold, Green Submitted, Green Published",,,44885,WOS:000794053600002,0

When citizens display increased openness to political attitude change, societies benefit as diverse viewpoints thrive, and less dissonant public spheres may be fostered. This contrasts with today's contentious political and media environment. With political polarization on the rise, and new social media avenues enabling citizens to curate more diverse news consumption patterns, little is known about how this polarization influences the ability for citizens to be politically persuaded in social media environments. Relying on representative US panel survey data, this study seeks to shed light on this phenomenon by testing the effects of three distinct types of political polarization: Affective, ideological, and perceived societal. Panel autoregressive causal order regression and structural equation models clarify the direct and indirect negative role of polarization in predicting social media political persuasion.

Digital platforms have reduced the gatekeeping power of traditional media and, potentially, they have increased the capacity of various kinds of actors to shape the agenda. We study this question in the Swiss context by examining the connections between three agendas: the traditional media agenda, the social media agenda of parties, and the social media agenda of politicians. Specifically, we validate and apply supervised machine learning classifiers to categorize 2.78 million articles published in 84 newspapers, 6,500 tweets posted on official party accounts, and 210,000 tweets posted by politicians on their own accounts from January 2018 until December 2019. We first use the classifier to measure the salience of the four most relevant issues of the period: the environment, Europe, gender equality, and immigration. Then, using a vector autoregression (VAR) approach, we analyze the relationship between the three agendas. Results show that not only do the traditional media agenda, the social media agenda of parties, and the social media agenda of politicians influence one another but, overall, no agenda leads the others more than it is led by them. There is one important exception: for the environment issue, the social media agenda of parties is more predictive of the traditional media agenda than vice-versa. These findings underscore how closely different agendas are tied together, but also show that advocacy campaigns may play an important role in both constraining and enabling parties to push their specific agendas.","[Gilardi, Fabrizio; Gessler, Theresa; Kubli, Mael] Univ Zurich, Dept Polit Sci, Affolternstr 56, CH-8050 Zurich, Switzerland; [Muller, Stefan] Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Polit & Int Relat, Dublin, Ireland",University of Zurich; University College Dublin,"Gilardi, F (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Dept Polit Sci, Affolternstr 56, CH-8050 Zurich, Switzerland.",gilardi@ipz.uzh.ch,"Gilardi, Fabrizio/AGF-1855-2022; Gessler, Theresa/AAB-5676-2019","Gessler, Theresa/0000-0003-2339-6266; Kubli, Mael/0000-0002-5592-9648; Gilardi, Fabrizio/0000-0002-0635-3048; Muller, Stefan/0000-0002-6315-4125",Swiss National Science Foundation [10DL11_183120]; European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union [883121],Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission); European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union(European Research Council (ERC)),This project received funding from the Swiss National Science Foundation (grant nr. 10DL11_183120) and the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program (grant agreement nr. 883121),,71,19,20,32,103,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

Yet the empirical record includes instances where corrective messages do and do not work, even on similar issues. Despite intense scholarly attention to this topic, it remains unclear when people will revise false beliefs. Our study examines a factor with a long history in the study of public opinion: the importance a person attaches to an issue. The subjective state of issue importance has complex effects. It can increase an individual's motivation to engage in effortful information processing while also leading them to defend existing beliefs and opinions. In a series of experiments administered in national surveys, we examine whether issue importance is implicated in the failure to correct false beliefs. The analyses show that on the topic of GM foods, the effects of a corrective message are smallest among misinformed people who rated the issue as personally important. By contrast, framing GM foods in terms of partisan identity engendered little resistance to a corrective message. Our findings illustrate the value of adopting a broader perspective on misinformation because people may resist corrections for reasons that are unrelated to their partisanship.","[Vidigal, Robert] NYU, Ctr Social Media & Polit, New York, NY USA; [Jerit, Jennifer] Silsby Hall Dartmouth Coll, Dept Govt, HB 6108, Hanover, NH 03755 USA",New York University,"Jerit, J (corresponding author), Silsby Hall Dartmouth Coll, Dept Govt, HB 6108, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.",jennifer.l.jerit@dartmouth.edu,,,,,,,63,0,0,3,3,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

However, when individuals find the information useful, they are more likely to consume cross-cutting sources. While crises such as terror attacks and pandemics can enhance the utility of cross-cutting information, empirical evidence on the role of real-world external threats in selective exposure is scarce. This paper examines the COVID-19 pandemic as a case study to test the extent to which citizens were exposed to information from cross-cutting sources on traditional and social media after the outbreak. Utilizing a two-wave panel survey among 14,218 participants across 17 countries - conducted before and after the initial outbreak - we show that citizens concerned about COVID-19 were more exposed to cross-cutting information on traditional and social media. The positive relationship with cross-cutting exposure to traditional news was stronger in countries where governments adopted less stringent policy responses, and in countries with greater pandemic severity and weaker democratic institutions. Our comparative approach thus sheds light on the social and political contexts in which cross-cutting exposure can occur.","[Zoizner, Alon] Univ Haifa, Commun, Haifa, Israel; [Sheafer, Tamir] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Polit Sci & Commun, Jerusalem, Israel; [Castro, Laia] Univ Barcelona, Polit Sci & Constitut Law, Barcelona, Spain; [Aalberg, Toril] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Sociol & Polit Sci, Trondheim, Norway; [Cardenal, Ana S.] Univ Oberta Catalunya, Law & Polit Sci, Barcelona, Spain; [Corbu, Nicoleta] Commun Natl Univ Polit Studies & Publ Adm, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [de Vreese, Claes] Univ Amsterdam, ASCoR, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Esser, Frank] Univ Zurich, Commun, Zurich, Switzerland; [Hopmann, David Nicolas] Univ Southern Denmark, Ctr Journalism, Odense, Denmark; [Hopmann, David Nicolas] Univ Southern Denmark, Ctr Digital Democracy, Odense, Denmark; [Koc-Michalska, Karolina] Univ Silesia, Commun Audencia Business Sch, Katowice, Poland; [Matthes, Joerg] Univ Vienna, Dept Commun, Vienna, Austria; [Schemer, Christian] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Commun, Mainz, Germany; [Splendore, Sergio] Univ Milan, Social & Polit Sci, Milan, Italy; [Stanyer, James; Stetka, Vaclav] Univ Loughborough, Commun & Media, Loughborough, Leics, England; [Stepinska, Agnieszka] Adam Mickiewicz Univ, Polit Sci & Journalism, Poznan, Poland; [Stromback, Jesper] Univ Gothenburg, Journalism Media & Commun, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Theocharis, Yannis] Tech Univ Munich, Governance, Munich, Germany; [Van Aelst, Peter] Univ Antwerp, Polit Sci, Antwerp, Belgium",University of Haifa; Hebrew University of Jerusalem; University of Barcelona; Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); UOC Universitat Oberta de Catalunya; University of Amsterdam; University of Zurich; University of Southern Denmark; University of Southern Denmark; University of Silesia in Katowice; University of Vienna; Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz; University of Milan; Loughborough University; Adam Mickiewicz University; University of Gothenburg; Technical University of Munich; University of Antwerp,"Zoizner, A (corresponding author), Univ Haifa, Dept Commun, IL-3498838 Haifa, Israel.",zoizner@com.haifa.ac.il,"; Cardenal, Ana S./E-5523-2014","Corbu, Nicoleta/0000-0001-9606-9827; Cardenal, Ana S./0000-0002-1540-8004; Koc-Michalska, Karolina/0000-0002-5354-5616; Zoizner, Alon/0000-0001-5574-3475; Sheafer, Tamir/0000-0002-9242-2264; Esser, Frank/0000-0002-1627-1521","Network of European Political Communication Scholars (NEPOCS); University of Southern Denmark; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/S01019X/1]; University of Milan; Audencia Foundation grant; research project Knowledge resistance: causes, consequences, cures - Riksbankens Jubileumsfond; ZeMKI Lenkungskreis","Network of European Political Communication Scholars (NEPOCS); University of Southern Denmark; Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); University of Milan; Audencia Foundation grant; research project Knowledge resistance: causes, consequences, cures - Riksbankens Jubileumsfond; ZeMKI Lenkungskreis","This project was financially supported by the Network of European Political Communication Scholars (NEPOCS).

This study uses the context of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, marked by discordant media agendas and ideological narratives, to explore how citizens produce shared understandings of conflicting political issues. It draws upon a series of focus groups with media audiences in Eastern Ukraine to explore the socially embedded, interactive reconstruction and renegotiation of shared meaning. Based on a discourse and conversation analysis of the content, group dynamics, and non-verbal cues in the discussions, the study distinguishes three interaction modes (inquiry, narrative, and avoidance) that define the conditions for audiences' opinion formation. The findings show that cooperation in inquiry mode facilitates deliberation, the adoption of rigid consensual boundaries in narrative mode increases polarization, whereas cynical detachment in avoidance mode preserves confusion. The article concludes by discussing the implications for socially mediated meaning-making and democratic potential of political talk.","[Pasitselska, Olga] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Commun & Journalism, Jerusalem, Israel",Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"Pasitselska, O (corresponding author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Commun & Journalism, Jerusalem, Israel.",olga.pasitselska@mail.huji.ac.il,,"Pasitselska, Olga/0000-0003-1306-2318",,,,,83,1,1,8,16,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

Higher engagement leads to higher visibility. Therefore, one of the major goals of political actors' Facebook communication is to produce content with the potential to provoke user engagement, and thereby increase their own visibility. This study introduces the concept of self-centered social media communication style which focuses on salient and owned issues with populist and negative appeals and investigates how user engagement is related to its main elements. We also explore how users' receptivity to these content-related factors is shaped by country context. More specifically, we hypothesize that users are more likely to react, comment on and share posts focusing on salient topics or issues owned by parties rather than more permanent policy issues, and posts including populist appeals and negativity. Further, we test how these effects are moderated by geographical regions and the level of party system polarization. We manually coded 9,703 Facebook posts of 68 parties from 12 European countries in the context of the 2019 European elections. Our findings show that users are more likely to engage with immigration-related, domestic, populist and negative posts, but react less to posts dealing with environmental or economic issues. While issue ownership does not play a significant role for user engagement, country context plays a minor role. However, some populist appeals are more effective in more polarized countries.","[Bene, Marton] Hungarian Acad Sci, Ctr Social Sci, Ctr Excellence, Budapest, Hungary; [Bene, Marton] Eotvos Lorand Univ, Pf 25, H-1097 Budapest, Hungary; [Ceron, Andrea] Univ Milan, Dept Social & Polit Sci, Milan, Italy; [Fenoll, Vicente] Univ Valencia, Dept Language Theory & Commun Sci, Valencia, Spain; [Hassler, Joerg; Schlosser, Katharina; Wurst, Anna-Katharina] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Media & Commun, Munich, Germany; [Kruschinski, Simon] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Dept Commun, Mainz, Germany; [Larsson, Anders Olof] Kristiania Univ Coll, Dept Commun, Oslo, Norway; [Magin, Melanie] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Sociol & Polit Sci, Trondheim, Norway",Hungarian Academy of Sciences; Hungarian Centre for Social Sciences; Eotvos Lorand University; University of Milan; University of Valencia; University of Munich; Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz; Kristiania University College; Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Bene, M (corresponding author), Eotvos Lorand Univ, Pf 25, H-1097 Budapest, Hungary.;Bene, M (corresponding author), Hungarian Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence, Pf 25, H-1097 Budapest, Hungary.;Bene, M (corresponding author), Toth Kalman U 4, H-1453 Budapest, Hungary.",bene.marton@tk.hu,"Kruschinski, Simon/GXG-6377-2022; Fenoll, Vicente/F-2409-2016","Fenoll, Vicente/0000-0002-5851-4237; Kruschinski, Dr. Simon/0000-0002-3185-5656; Hassler, Jorg/0000-0003-2907-5228; Bene, Marton/0000-0003-0177-9717; Larsson, Anders Olof/0000-0003-3621-4687; Schlosser, Katharina/0000-0002-4172-7121; Ceron, Andrea/0000-0002-6686-5969; Wurst, Anna-Katharina/0000-0003-1371-7652; Magin, Melanie/0000-0003-2545-3594","Bavarian State Ministry of Science and the Arts; Incubator program of the Center for Social Sciences, Eotvos Lorand Research Network [03013645]; Bolyai Janos Research Fellowship - Hungarian Academy of Sciences [BO/334_20]","Bavarian State Ministry of Science and the Arts; Incubator program of the Center for Social Sciences, Eotvos Lorand Research Network; Bolyai Janos Research Fellowship - Hungarian Academy of Sciences","This publication is part of the work of the junior research group DigiDeMo which is funded by the Bavarian State Ministry of Science and the Arts and coordinated by the Bavarian Research Institute for Digital Transformation (bidt) and also supported by the Incubator program of the Center for Social Sciences, Eotvos Lorand Research Network (project number: 03013645) and Bolyai Janos Research Fellowship awarded by the Hungarian Academy of Sciences (BO/334_20).",,73,2,2,11,15,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

In this article, I argue however that it is important is to clarify whether the answer depends on the extent to which the focus is on media or on politics, or the extent to which the role of the media in political processes is viewed positively or negatively. With respect to the assessment of the role of media in political processes, it is also important to distinguish between assessments based on a priori normative assumptions and based on empirical results. In conclusion, it is argued that the strength of political communication research lies in its interdisciplinarity.

Most inter-actor relationships also tended to be moderated than mediated, implying the nature of findings as more exploratory and conditional than confirmatory and causal, and that cases were overdrawn from Western countries. In discussing possible reasons and implications for these findings, we call on scholars to move beyond studying micro-processes related to citizens' cognitions, attitudes, and behaviors, and explicitly anchor them to higher-level societal ramifications; incorporate the investigation of causal processes of inter-actor relationships; and make concrete affirmative actions to de-Westernize political communication research.","[Dumdum, Omar O.] Univ Wisconsin, Sch Journalism & Mass Commun, 5115 Vilas Hall,821 Univ Ave, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Bankston, Levi] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Polit Sci, Madison, WI 53706 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Dumdum, OO (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Sch Journalism & Mass Commun, 5115 Vilas Hall,821 Univ Ave, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",dumdum@wisc.edu,"Dumdum, Omar O/L-8994-2017","Dumdum, Omar O/0000-0002-7425-6565",,,,,46,0,0,6,11,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

A quantitative content analysis of 14,293 posts from 111 (2014) and 116 (2019) political parties shows that negative emotion, negative campaigning, dramatization, and populist content has increased over this time. We show that political parties sought to evoke more negative emotions and generate more dramatization, engaged more in negative campaigning, and included more populist content in their Facebook posts in the 2019 EP election than in 2014. Further, we show that posts evoking negative emotions and dramatization and involving negative campaigning yield higher user engagement than other posts, while populist content also led to more user reactions in 2014, but not in 2019. Negative, exaggerated, and sensationalized messaging therefore makes sense from a strategic perspective, because the increased frequencies of likes, shares, and comments make parties' messages travel farther and deeper in social networks, thereby reaching a wider audience.

First, we examine whether transcripts capture the emotional content of speeches. We find that transcripts capture sentiment, but not emotional arousal. Second, we compare strategies for the automated analysis of sentiment in text. We find that leading approaches performed reasonably well, but sentiment dictionaries generated using word embeddings surpassed these other approaches. Finally, we test the robustness of the approach based on word embeddings. Although the methodology is reasonably robust to alternative specifications, we find that dictionaries created using word embeddings are sensitive to the choice of seed words and to training corpus size.

These perspectives highlight the importance of emotional dimensions of news use beyond its presumed value as a source of information. While political communication scholarship has often treated news consumption as the cornerstone of good citizenship, we find avoiders hold uneven, weakly internalized norms about a perceived duty to stay informed, in part because they anticipate news will make them anxious without being relevant to their lives, resulting in limited engagement with news, and by extension, civic and political affairs.

While political communication processes have been shown to influence inter-party hostility, the literature has so far focused mainly on mass-mediated communication. We argue here that affective polarization might also be determined by interpersonal political communication. Specifically, we hypothesize that heterogeneous political discussions - those transcending partisan and ideological boundaries - are associated with decreased hostility toward the other side. We test this hypothesis with three studies conducted in Canada: A cross-sectional survey (N = 3,596), a two-wave panel (N = 3,408), and an instrumental variable analysis (N = 2,005). We find that heterogeneous discussion indeed is associated with reduced polarization, a conclusion that holds across indicators of affect, obtains for both face-to-face and online discussions, and is consistent across studies. Having a heterogeneous (compared to homogeneous) discussion network predicts substantial decreases of up to 0.76, and no less than 0.09, standard deviations in out-party hostility. These findings inform scholarly debates about the antecedents of affective polarization and are consistent with the claim that cross-cutting political discussion can benefit democracy.","[Amsalem, Eran] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Commun, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel; [Merkley, Eric; Loewen, Peter John] Univ Toronto, Munk Sch Global Affairs & Publ Policy, Toronto, ON, Canada",Hebrew University of Jerusalem; University of Toronto,"Amsalem, E (corresponding author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Commun, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel.",eran.amsalem@mail.huji.ac.il,,"Merkley, Eric/0000-0001-7647-9650",,,,,60,3,3,2,14,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

Despite the fact that populism/anti-populism divides (re-)emerged as central political fault-lines, scholarship has paid little attention to the concept's potential to look at how populist polarization restructures media-politics connections in Latin America and elsewhere. Through a combination of content analysis, in-depth interviews and other sources, this article traces shifts in news media alignments and journalistic practices during and following the recent experience of leftist-populist rule in Argentina. It argues that news media shifted to a distinct form of political parallelism organized around the populism/anti-populism divide in which most private mainstream news media assumed an active political role in the mobilization of anti-populism. The article provides a broader understanding of political parallelism that applies to settings of competitive-electoral populist politics and sheds light on not only news media alignments, but also media involvement in the political task of cleavage construction. Scholarly research on Latin America, given its focus on instrumental media-politics connections or its concerns over populist threats to media freedom, generally misses both the politicizing role of anti-populist media and the ways in which they mirror populist style.","[Kitzberger, Philip] Univ Torcuato Tella, CONICET, Dept Ciencia Polit & Estudios Int, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina",Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); Universidad Torcuato Di Tella,"Kitzberger, P (corresponding author), Univ Torcuato Tella, Dept Ciencia Polit & Estudios Int, Av Figueroa Alcorta 7350,C1428BCW, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",pkitzberger@utdt.edu,,,,,,,59,0,0,2,2,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

The answer is unclear, because local news typically focuses on local, not national, stories, and is politically neutral. But the rise of Sinclair Broadcasting, now the nation's second-largest owner of local TV stations, upends that assumption. News on Sinclair-owned stations focuses more on national topics, and presents them with a right-wing slant. Given this, we might expect it to shift its viewers' attitudes in a pro-Republican direction. Using data on Sinclair's acquisition of local TV stations between 2008 and 2018, I show that living in an area with a Sinclair-owned TV station lowers viewers' approval of President Obama during his tenure in office, and makes viewers less likely to vote for the Democratic nominee for president. This has important implications for our understanding of the effects of local TV news, as well as for media trust, as I discuss in the conclusion.","[Levendusky, Matthew S.] Univ Penn, Dept Polit Sci, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Levendusky, Matthew S.] Univ Penn, Inst Democracy, Annenberg Publ Policy Ctr, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania; University of Pennsylvania,"Levendusky, MS (corresponding author), Univ Penn, Dept Polit Sci, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.;Levendusky, MS (corresponding author), Univ Penn, Inst Democracy, Annenberg Publ Policy Ctr, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",mleven@upenn.edu,,,,,,,45,3,3,2,13,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

We theorize that governments outsource because it provides plausible deniability if the operation is uncovered, and offers access to cutting-edge influence tactics beyond those common to established government institutions. Using data from Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, we test implications of this theory via two covert online influence campaign case studies, each focused on Syria, executed by Russia's military intelligence agency (colloquially known as the GRU), and by the Internet Research Agency (IRA), a privately owned company. We find that the GRU focused on the creation of front media properties that produced longform journalistic content, an established tactic more amenable to reaching general audiences. By contrast, the IRA exploited the architecture of social media platforms to target specific audiences with memes and customized messages that were more narrowly tailored than those spread by the GRU. We also find that the tailored content produced by the IRA received higher engagement than GRU longform articles when posted to the same platforms, even if we include cascades of interactions from re-posts of GRU-authored articles that spread beyond their own Facebook page. Our findings highlight the importance of disaggregating information operations by actor type and across platforms to better understand their tactics and impact.","[DiResta, Renee; Grossman, Shelby] Stanford Univ, Stanford Internet Observ, Encina Hall, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Siegel, Alexandra] Univ Colorado, Dept Polit Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",Stanford University; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Grossman, S (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Stanford Internet Observ, Encina Hall, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",shelbygrossman@stanford.edu,"Siegel, Alexandra A./M-1331-2019","Siegel, Alexandra A./0000-0003-0792-7813; Grossman, Shelby/0000-0003-4941-7969",,,,,55,0,0,10,16,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

This study builds on the stereotype content model that conceptualizes gender stereotypes on a competence and a warmth dimension. We examine a potential double bind for leading female right-wing populists between, on the one hand, the need to demonstrate competence to succeed politically and, on the other hand, to conform to gender stereotypes of female politicians. We use a mixed-method design comprising a content analysis of N = 724 Instagram posts of leading European male and female right-wing populists and an online experiment with N = 163 male and female adult participants. This allows us to analyze how leading female right-wing populists represent themselves in terms of warmth and competence in comparison to their male counterparts and how these strategies affect participants' evaluations. The content analysis shows that female populists represent themselves as slightly colder but more competent than their male colleagues regarding their social roles and both warmer and more competent in their non-verbal behavior. The subsequent online experiment shows that the effects of these strategies on participants' evaluation of right-wing populists' warmth and competence do not differ between female and male politicians. This suggests that a greater emphasis on warm traits would not necessarily harm female populist leaders as they were not evaluated differently than their male colleagues in this respect. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.","[Bast, Jennifer; Renner, Anna-Maria] Univ Koblenz Landau, Dept Polit Sci, Koblenz, Germany; [Oschatz, Corinna] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Commun Res ASCoR, Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Koblenz & Landau; University of Amsterdam,"Bast, J (corresponding author), Univ Koblenz Landau, Dept Polit Sci, Koblenz, Germany.",bastj@uni-landau.de,"Bast, Jennifer/AAJ-3008-2021","Bast, Jennifer/0000-0001-6521-0891; Oschatz, Corinna/0000-0003-3276-5721","Research Network Communication, Media, and Politics, University of Koblenz-Landau","Research Network Communication, Media, and Politics, University of Koblenz-Landau","This work was supported by the Research Network Communication, Media, and Politics, University of Koblenz-Landau.",,78,1,1,10,18,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

Evidence from a Longitudinal Study,POLITICAL COMMUNICATION,,,English,Article,,,,,,Social media; representation; campaign; contact with politicians,FACEBOOK; TWITTER; POPULISM; SUPPORT; DEMAND,"Modern democracies are built around the idea of representation: the electorate is represented, and perhaps more importantly, should feel represented. Yet recent decades have been marked by a growing gap between citizens and the political system. The emergence of new, more direct communication channels such as social media gave rise to expectations that the two sides can be brought closer together. This study investigates whether a connection with politicians and parties via social media platforms can enhance citizens' feelings of being represented by a certain politician or party (dyadic representation), or by the entire parliament (collective representation). Our data come from a two-year panel study, covering four Israeli elections. Findings demonstrate that passive (receiving political information), but not active (producing political information) connection increases dyadic representation perceptions. Collective representation perceptions, by contrast, were not affected by either type of connection. Furthermore, our analysis does not demonstrate a reverse causal order; we did not find evidence supporting the idea that representation perceptions influence connection with politicians or parties. The upshot of our findings is that unidirectional communication between politicians and citizens on social media can foster citizens' feelings of being represented in the political arena and of closeness with the political elites. That said, such effects were obtained only with regard to dyadic representation and are therefore limited in scope. The study contributes to the ongoing theoretical debate concerning the complex relations between new technologies, citizens, and political elites.","[Dvir-Gvirsman, Shira; Tsuriel, Keren; Shamir, Michal] Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Commun, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Sheafer, Tamir; Shenhav, Shaul; Zoizner, Alon] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Social Sci Fac, Jerusalem, Israel; [Zoizner, Alon] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Polit Sci, Jerusalem, Israel; [Waismel-Manor, Israel] Univ Haifa, Dept Commun, Haifa, Israel; [Lavi, Liron] Nazarian Ctr Israel Studies, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Waismel-Manor, Israel] Sch Polit Sci, Israel Studies, Tel Aviv, Israel",Tel Aviv University; Hebrew University of Jerusalem; Hebrew University of Jerusalem; University of Haifa,"Dvir-Gvirsman, S (corresponding author), Tel Aviv Univ, Commun Dept, Ramat Aviv POB 39040, IL-61390 Tel Aviv, Israel.",shiradvir@me.com,,,Israeli science foundation [2315/18],Israeli science foundation(Israel Science Foundation),This work was supported by the Israeli science foundation [2315/18].,,42,0,0,6,6,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

One factor inhibiting our understanding in this area is the paucity of systematic measures of ethnic appeals. To help in rectifying this gap, I present an approach to identifying and measuring different types of ethnic campaign appeals - termed bonding and bridging appeals, respectively. I then apply that approach to an original dataset of over 1,500 election posters from almost 250 candidates competing in Indonesian elections. The findings indicate that candidates made ethnic bonding appeals if their ethnic group was politically viable in terms of both size and the lack of social constraints on appealing to that group. Meanwhile, candidates from nonviable groups bridged across ethnic groups or bypassed ethnicity entirely. When candidates belonged to two ethnic categories, they used the simple heuristic that bonding trumps bridging to guide their appeal strategy. These findings illustrate the importance of looking beyond ethnic demographics and also casts doubt on the broadly accepted expectation that candidates will appeal to the ethnic group that is of minimum winning size. Ultimately, the article helps us understand candidates' communication strategies and why ethnic diversity actually results in less exclusivist ethnic politics.","[Fox, Colm A.] Singapore Management Univ, Sch Social Sci, 10 Canning Rise 05-01, Singapore 179873, Singapore",Singapore Management University,"Fox, CA (corresponding author), Singapore Management Univ, Sch Social Sci, 10 Canning Rise 05-01, Singapore 179873, Singapore.",colmfox@smu.edu.sg,,"Fox, Colm/0000-0003-1055-1554",,,,,63,0,0,1,1,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

This study focuses on amplification by elites on social media and examines the extent to which traditional media and emerging partisan influencers engage in network amplification. Defined as like-minded elites sharing similar or/and mutual messages, network amplification highlights the interrelation and interaction between elite messages in the network communication environment of social media. This is a phenomenon worth investigating because network amplification's resulting message repetition and reinforcement can multiply the overall effectiveness of elite messaging. Using network sampling and spectral clustering, we collected 358,707 accounts that followed 2,069,311 accounts on Twitter and detected nine distinct networks of traditional media and emerging partisan influencers. We then examined their 3,540,629 tweets related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Results show that 1) conservative media and influencers engaged in network amplification of politicized information and misinformation significantly more than liberal media and influencers did; 2) conservative influencers exhibited a stronger tendency to retweet and align their messages with conservative media than liberal influencers did regarding liberal media; and 3) traditional media partially drove partisan influencers' amplification.

This article combines natural language processing (NLP), statistical analysis of U.S. mass shooting events (1990-2016) and an in-depth case-study comparison to evaluate whether media exhibit patterns in how they frame mass shooters from different racial and/or religious groups. First, we use NLP to target and model the specific adjectives media use to describe mass shooters. We find identifiable text patterns in the adjectives media apply to mass shooters that vary along racial/religious lines. Second, we statistically estimate disagreement between established definitions of terrorism and media associations with the term terrorism (excluding negations). This analysis suggests that media disproportionately fail to link non-Muslim white perpetrators to events that should properly be considered terrorism. Our in-depth case-study comparison reinforces and contextualizes these results. This research provides scientific evidence to support the increasingly prominent public speculation that U.S. institutions insufficiently acknowledge the threat of white-perpetrated terrorism. We suggest that biased media coverage reflects and contributes to a process by which certain identity groups are framed as outsiders.","[Dreier, Sarah K.] Univ New Mexico, Polit Sci, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA; [Gade, Emily K.] Emory Univ, Polit Sci, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Card, Dallas] Univ Michigan, Sch Informat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Smith, Noah A.] Univ Washington, Paul G Allen Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",University of New Mexico; Emory University; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Dreier, SK (corresponding author), Univ New Mexico, Polit Sci, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA.",skdreier@unm.edu,,"Card, Dallas/0000-0001-5573-8836",University of Washington Innovation Award; National Science Foundation [1823547],University of Washington Innovation Award; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),This work was supported in part by a University of Washington Innovation Award and National Science Foundation [1823547].,,130,0,0,0,0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

Second, degrees of fragmentation vary to a great extent between different parties.

By estimating newsroom ideology independent of content we show that newsroom ideology influences the responsiveness of newspapers to the demands of readers. We find that newsroom ideology has an effect on the ideological slant of news content even after controlling for consumer preferences. While consumer demand influences the ideological content of the news, the ideology of the newsroom that produces the news skews the responsiveness to the demands of readership and ultimately affects the production of ideological slant in the news.","[Hassell, Hans J.

This article theorizes that banning social media platforms with existing user bases triggers the psychological mechanism of reactance. Reactance motivates citizens to circumvent bans and ultimately results in intensified criticism of the censoring authorities on banned platforms. Reactance dynamics in response to social media bans are particularly relevant in countries with hybrid regimes - that is, regimes with both democratic and autocratic characteristics. Authorities in these countries generally allow widespread adoption of social media platforms. At the same time, they engage in temporary platform bans, usually to limit antiregime discourse at crucial political junctures such as elections. This combination of large user bases and temporary bans creates a reactance equilibrium in which there is high demand among citizens to access the restricted platforms. Unlike with censorship of traditional media such as television and print news outlets, the costs for citizens to circumvent social media bans are relatively low, which allows citizens to act on their reactance states. Drawing on a dataset of 15 million geolocated tweets, this article presents evidence of a censorship backlash to Turkey's March 2014 Twitter ban, which is considered among the first attempts to block a widely adopted social media platform. A synthetic control model and descriptive statistics reveal widespread circumvention of the ban. Furthermore, sentiment analysis shows that, in the wake of the ban, Twitter discourse became increasingly negative, especially toward the ban's main progenitor then-Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan.","[Miller, Andrew Cesare] US Naval Acad, Dept Polit Sci, Annapolis, MD USA",United States Department of Defense; United States Navy; United States Naval Academy,"Miller, AC (corresponding author), US Naval Acad, Annapolis, MD 21402 USA.",millera@usna.edu,,"Miller, Andrew/0000-0001-5634-9699",,,,,70,0,0,4,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

While there is a growing literature on online incivility faced by politicians, little is known about how campaign teams interpret and respond to it. To address that gap, we analyze in-depth interviews with 31 candidates and campaign staff from the 2019 federal election in Canada. We find that campaign teams interpret incivility according to the intensity of messages' content, but also their frequency, source, and target. They use these criteria to assess potential harms in three areas: security and psychological wellbeing, strategic campaign activities, and inclusive democratic discourse. Based on these assessments, campaign teams use a limited set of platform affordances to ignore, monitor, engage, or block uncivil voices. Our analysis shows that interpretations of incivility are more nuanced and multi-dimensional than most scholarship recognizes. We also reveal the often-hidden labor that campaign teams devote to content moderation, as they try to balance protecting themselves, defending their campaign messaging, and creating space for civil discussion. By paying closer attention to campaign teams' mediation and moderation of online incivility, scholars can better understand its consequences for democratic political participation in elections.","[Tenove, Chris; Tworek, Heidi] Univ British Columbia, Sch Publ Policy & Global Affairs, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Lore, Grace] Legislat Assembly British Columbia, Victoria, BC, Canada; [Buffie, Jordan] Simon Fraser Univ, Fac Educ, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Deley, Trevor] Univ Ottawa, Dept Commun, Ottawa, ON, Canada",University of British Columbia; Simon Fraser University; University of Ottawa,"Tenove, C (corresponding author), Sch Publ Policy & Global Affairs, 6476 NW Marine Dr, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z2, Canada.",cjtenove@mail.ubc.ca,,"Tworek, Heidi/0000-0001-8825-7895; Tenove, Chris/0000-0002-4244-0878; Deley, Trevor/0000-0002-3111-0208",Government of Canada; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [892-2020-0064],Government of Canada(CGIAR); Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"Digital Ecosystem Research Challenge, funded in part by the Government of Canada;Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [892-2020-0064].",,43,0,0,3,3,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

In this study, we develop a quantitative model to predict violence endorsement as a function of repression severity, group identification, and individual emotions. We situate our investigation in the context of the Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill Movement in Hong Kong, during which the public acceptance of violence increased substantially, contrasting the city's long history of peaceful protests. Results show that violence endorsement is associated with repression severity in a U-shaped fashion. While limited repression deters violence endorsement, excessive repression crossing a proportionality threshold escalates it. Group identification is a salient moderator that amplifies the backfire effects of repression. People who are more attached to protesting groups are more vigilant about repression and more supportive of protest violence. Furthermore, we also find that individual emotions exert more significant influences than repression and group identification. Anger, disgust, and fear can result in radicalized opinions. These findings unpack the complex and multifaceted communicative processes that shape the perceptions of protest violence. In contrast to the rational, organizational, and structural models of social movements, we argue that this analytical framework can offer more insights into protest dynamics amid the increasingly personalized political participation.","[Zhu, Yuner; Cheng, Edmund W.; Walker, Richard M.] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Publ Policy, Kowloon Tong, 83 Tat Chee Ave, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Yuner; Cheng, Edmund W.; Shen, Fei; Walker, Richard M.] City Univ Hong Kong, Ctr Publ Affairs & Law, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Shen, Fei] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Media & Commun, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",City University of Hong Kong; City University of Hong Kong; City University of Hong Kong,"Cheng, EW (corresponding author), City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Publ Policy, Kowloon Tong, 83 Tat Chee Ave, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",ew.cheng@cityu.edu.hk,"Walker, Richard Mark/A-4139-2010","Walker, Richard Mark/0000-0003-1503-1814; ZHU, Yuner/0000-0003-2772-2188; SHEN, Fei/0000-0002-6682-1712",Hong Kong Institute for Data Science [9360163]; Hong Kong Research Grants Council [11605820],Hong Kong Institute for Data Science; Hong Kong Research Grants Council(Hong Kong Research Grants Council),This work was supported by the Hong Kong Institute for Data Science (grant no. 9360163) and the Hong Kong Research Grants Council (grant no. 11605820).,,97,4,4,5,8,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

In the evolving and participatory media-politics landscape, it becomes important to ask how the cross-disciplinary project of political communication research is keeping pace with changing conditions that provide a greater structural role for the press in politics and new technology in the enactment of citizenship. To track these trends in research, this paper reports the results of a longitudinal content analysis of research articles published in the journals Political Communication and the International Journal of Press/Politics for the period 1996-2016. For each year, we selected one issue at random and examined all research articles in that issue, excluding reviews, invited theme essays, and commentaries. Altogether, 229 articles were included in the analysis. Results indicate a noticeable increase in the internationalization of political communication research over the 20-year analysis period, a slight decrease in research expressing a negative evaluative tone toward the media over time, and consistent growth in the percentage of articles with a media-centric focus, defined as positioning the press as a central consideration in the study and regarding news media as central to democratic life. In light of these findings, the unique interpretive lenses that researchers adopt depending on discipline are explored in relation to ongoing developments in political communication research.","[Bucy, Erik P.] Texas Tech Univ, Coll Media & Commun, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA; [Evans, Heather K.] Univ Virginias Coll Wise, Dept Polit Sci, Wise, WV USA",Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University,"Bucy, EP (corresponding author), Texas Tech Univ, Coll Media & Commun, Strateg Commun, 3003 15th St, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA.",erik.bucy@ttu.edu,,"Bucy, Erik/0000-0003-4925-2244",,,,,24,1,1,4,23,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

Guided by feelings-as-information theory, it was argued that when direct democracy ballot issues do not receive any campaign expenditures and are not about moral/civic issues, voters are likely to encounter these ballots for the first time in the voting booth. And when this is the case, how these ballots are written should affect vote choice. In support of study hypotheses, it was found that the difficulty of the words on the ballot affected people's processing fluency, defined as the ease with which people processed the information presented. In turn, self-reports of processing fluency influenced vote choice. Specifically, easier texts were more likely to be supported and difficult texts were more likely to be opposed or abstained from voting on. As hypothesized, this relationship was mediated through self-reports of processing fluency. Additionally, to demonstrate the external validity of this process, it was found that the voting results obtained in the two laboratory studies replicated real-world election results 86% of the time. These results offer communicative and psychological insight into how communication affects information processing, and how these processing experiences inform political decisions of consequence to everyday life.","[Shulman, Hillary C.; Sweitzer, Matthew D.; Coronel, Jason C.; Bond, Robert M.; Poulsen, Shannon] Ohio State Univ, Sch Commun, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Bullock, Olivia M.] George Washington Univ, Dept Org Sci & Commun, Washington, DC USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; George Washington University,"Shulman, HC (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Sch Commun, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",shulman.36@osu.edu,"Bond, Robert Meade/A-1561-2014; Shulman, Hillary/AAN-8625-2021","Shulman, Hillary/0000-0001-7525-8119; Sweitzer, Matthew/0000-0002-2075-6177; Poulsen, Shannon/0000-0002-7680-0253; Coronel, Jason/0000-0001-6397-3860; Bullock, Olivia/0000-0001-5403-7149",School of Communication's annual Miller Research Award,School of Communication's annual Miller Research Award,The data for this study was made possible through funds awarded by the School of Communication's annual Miller Research Award.,,44,0,0,1,1,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

Network analysis measures of political groups registered with the Federal Election Committee in the United States (n = 2,064) and the types of companies they hired for digital political advertising services (political agencies, commercial agencies, digital advertising platforms, or other; n = 1,022) over three midterm and general elections (2006-2016) show that the number of political committees and companies have both dramatically increased since 2008 and that Facebook and Google have become the two most central members of the network. As influencers of the targeting and content of campaign messages, these companies should be considered consequential members of electoral party networks.

What accounts for the variation in news coverage received by different foreign countries? While existing literature points to political concerns at home, in this article, we argue that a regime's economic interests can also be a driving force: the desire to deepen its international economic engagement can motivate the regime to treat foreign countries differently in its news coverage. To test this argument, we examine foreign news coverage by China's state-run television network between 2003 and 2018. Combining textual and quantitative analysis, we find that countries with stronger economic ties with China receive more favorable news coverage. Moreover, the manipulation of coverage favorability is achieved through selective reporting: negative events such as armed conflicts receive less coverage when taking place in a country with close economic ties with China. These findings contribute to our understanding of international news flow, especially in a non-Western setting. They also demonstrate a pragmatic rather than political use of information control by an authoritarian government.","[Ji, Chengyuan] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Int & Publ Affairs, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Liu, Hanzhang] Pitzer Coll, Dept Polit Studies, Claremont, CA 91711 USA",Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Claremont Colleges; Pitzer College,"Liu, HZ (corresponding author), Pitzer Coll, Dept Polit Studies, Claremont, CA 91711 USA.",hanzhang_liu@pitzer.edu,,"Liu, Hanzhang/0000-0003-1003-1372; Ji, Chengyuan/0000-0001-8892-3982",,,,,47,0,0,11,32,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

However, Black people and people from some numerically smaller racial/ethnic groups were more likely than White people to engage in symbolic behaviors such as using hashtags and changing their profile picture. While there was some evidence that differences in socioeconomic status and political interest may explain White people's higher likelihood of political expression, identity-related factors played a counter-stratifying role. Racial/ethnic minorities were more likely than White people to view their racial group as having too little influence in American politics, a perception which was in turn positively related to political expression on social media.

However, we expect that racial outreach will matter more when it comes from non-descriptive representatives because Black representatives are perceived as empathetic regardless of their actions. We test these hypotheses using two separate experiments. We find that Black Americans are more politically active when non-Black politicians discuss their intentions to advance Black political interest.

The algorithmic filter bubbles and echo chambers that have popularized these platforms may also increase exposure to fake news. Because of this, scholars have suggested disrupting the stream of congruent information that filter bubbles and echo chambers produce, as this may reduce the impact and circulation of misinformation. To test this, a survey experiment was conducted via Amazon MTurk. Participants read 10 short stories that were either all fake or half real and half fake. These treatment conditions were made up of stories agreeable to the perspective of Democrats, Republicans, or a mix of both. The results show that participants assigned to conditions that were agreeable to their political world view found fake stories more believable compared to participants who received a heterogeneous mix of news stories complementary to both world views. However, this break up effect appears confined to Democratic participants; findings indicate that Republicans assigned to filter bubble treatment conditions believed fake news stories at approximately the same rate as their fellow partisans receiving a heterogeneous mix of news items. This suggests that a potential break up may only influence more progressive users.","[Rhodes, Samuel C.] Utah Valley Univ, Hist & Polit Sci Dept, Orem, UT 84058 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; Utah Valley University,"Rhodes, SC (corresponding author), Utah Valley Univ, MS 185,800 W Univ Pkwy, Orem, UT 84058 USA.",samuel.rhodes@uvu.edu,,"Rhodes, Samuel/0000-0003-3695-5661",,,,,72,9,9,22,86,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

In two surveys of samples mirroring the adult population conducted before the vote (total N = 4018), we showed respondents 24 different news statements and asked if they had seen them before, whether they believed them, and how likely they would be to share them on social media. The statements included actual disinformation that was circulating and had been debunked, placebos that did not feature in the campaign but were carefully constructed to resemble actual false statements spreading at the time, and true statements that were being reported during the campaign. We find that the more that respondents received their campaign news via professional news organizations, the more they were able to distinguish true from false information. Conversely, the more that respondents used social media for campaign news, the less they were able to distinguish true from false information. These differences also shaped the intention to share true versus false news, and false news, once perceived as accurate, was more likely to be shared than true news overall. This campaign disinformation divide between getting news from professional journalistic organizations and news from social media has important implications for contemporary election campaigns in democratic public spheres.","[Vaccari, Cristian; Chadwick, Andrew; Kaiser, Johannes] Loughborough Univ, Sch Social Sci & Humanities, Brockington Bldg U3-19,Epinal Way, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England",Loughborough University,"Vaccari, C (corresponding author), Loughborough Univ, Sch Social Sci & Humanities, Brockington Bldg U3-19,Epinal Way, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England.",c.vaccari@lboro.ac.uk,,"VACCARI, CRISTIAN/0000-0003-0380-8921",,,,,45,0,0,5,5,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

In this article, we argue that dictators need to allow for a higher level of media freedom when sharing more power with other elites. Specifically, dictators create transparency through media freedom to induce trust and cooperation among elites within the regime. We confirm the hypothesis by analyzing data from 98 dictatorships from 1960 to 2010. Our finding is robust to different model specifications. This article contributes to the literature by showing that authoritarian media freedom is determined by not only dictators' need for local information as the conventional wisdom suggests, but also the power dynamics within their ruling coalitions.","[Sheen, Greg Chih-Hsin] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Tainan, Taiwan; [Tung, Hans H.] Natl Taiwan Univ, Ctr Res Econometr Theory & Applicat, Taipei, Taiwan; [Wu, Wen-Chin] Acad Sinica, Inst Polit Sci, Taipei 115, Taiwan",National Cheng Kung University; National Taiwan University; Academia Sinica - Taiwan,"Wu, WC (corresponding author), Acad Sinica, Inst Polit Sci, Taipei 115, Taiwan.",wenchinwu@sinica.edu.tw,"Tung, Hans H./AHC-3029-2022; Sheen, Greg Chih-Hsin/AAK-1447-2021","Tung, Hans H./0000-0001-5332-7582; Sheen, Greg Chih-Hsin/0000-0003-1961-7804; Wu, Wen-Chin/0000-0002-3229-4619","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [110-2423-H-001-002-MY4,110-2634-F-002-045]; Ministry of Education, Taiwan [110L900203]","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, TaiwanMinistry of Science, ICT & Future Planning, Republic of Korea); Ministry of Education, Taiwan(Ministry of Education, Taiwan)","This work was supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [110-2423-H-001-002-MY4,110-2634-F-002-045]; Ministry of Education, Taiwan [110L900203].",,55,1,1,5,14,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

This study investigated the narratives produced in news coverage of Black Lives Matter protests and how media consumption and individual predispositions help us understand public support for the movement. Combining a content analysis of news about protests and a survey of people's attitudes, we assessed if patterns in mainstream and partisan coverage have changed, and how those patterns relate to people's level of support for the movement, assessment of its effectiveness, and of police response during demonstrations. Our findings suggest that persistent negative patterns of protest coverage continued to dominate news headlines, with a major emphasis on negative actions, disruption, and violence in centerist- and right-leaning media coverage from the Associated Press, CNN and Fox News. MSNBC produced the least coverage overall, but their coverage was most legitimizing. Survey results showed that preexisting attitudes remain consistently stronger determinants of support for the movement than media coverage and suggested a possible ideological asymmetry among the general public. Conservative affiliation and news consumption are strong predictors of less support for Black Lives Matter and perceptions of police response to these protests as too lenient. Mainstream news consumption, though producing predominantly delegitimizing coverage, is correlated with more support for Black Lives Matter.","[Brown, Danielle K.] Univ Minnesota, Hubbard Sch Journalism & Mass Commun, 111 Murphy Hall,206 Church St SE, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Mourao, Rachel R.] Michigan State Univ, Sch Journalism, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; Michigan State University,"Brown, DK (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Hubbard Sch Journalism & Mass Commun, 111 Murphy Hall,206 Church St SE, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",Danielle.Brown.PhD@gmail.com,,"Brown, Danielle/0000-0001-7637-8964",,,,,45,0,0,0,0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

This study seeks to understand this disconnect by conducting an observational analysis of the most popular accounts on American Twitter. We identify opinion leaders by drawing random samples of ordinary American Twitter users and observing whom they follow. We estimate the ideological leaning and political relevance of these opinion leaders and crowdsource estimates of perceived ideology. We find little evidence that American Twitter is as politicized as it is made out to be, with politics and hard news outlets constituting a small subset of these opinion leaders. Ordinary Americans are significantly more likely to follow nonpolitical opinion leaders on Twitter than political opinion leaders. We find no evidence of polarization among these opinion leaders either. While a few political professional categories are more polarized than others, the overall polarization dissipates when we factor in the rate at which the opinion leaders tweet: a large number of vocal nonpartisan opinion leaders drowns out the partisan voices on the platform. Our results suggest that the degree to which Twitter is political has likely been overstated in the past. Our findings have implications about how we use Twitter and social media, in general, to represent public opinion in the United States.","[Mukerjee, Subhayan; Jaidka, Kokil] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Commun & New Media, Block AS6,03-19,11 Comp Dr, Singapore 117416, Singapore; [Lelkes, Yphtach] Univ Penn, Annenberg Sch Commun, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",National University of Singapore; University of Pennsylvania,"Mukerjee, S (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Commun & New Media, Block AS6,03-19,11 Comp Dr, Singapore 117416, Singapore.",mukerjee@nus.edu.sg,,"Mukerjee, Subhayan/0000-0002-1885-5440; Jaidka, Kokil/0000-0002-8127-1157",,,,,71,0,0,8,8,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

We argue that censors are more likely to target outlets and journalists that provide information to politically consequential audiences, while allowing media that caters to non-pivotal audiences to report more freely. In order to test our hypotheses, we built a new dataset of around 9,000 salient censorship events and their characteristics across 196 countries between 2001 and 2015. We find strong empirical support for media market segmentation. Outlets and journalists with wide audiences, collective action coverage and domestic ownership are significantly more at risk of severe censorship actions. We also find that audience pivotality matters more than the number and diversity of outlets for censors' strategic calculus.

In addition, the mechanism explaining the mechanism through which discussions affect intergroup attitudes is not clear. This 3-wave study of Swedish adolescents (N = 892, 51.1% girls, M-ageT1 = 13.41, nested in 35 classrooms) examined the role of teacher-initiated political discussions in the classroom for the development of youth attitudes toward immigrants. The results of multilevel analysis showed that adolescents who perceived political discussions to be less frequent increased in anti-immigrant attitudes compared to youth with more frequent discussions. Similarly, classrooms with less deliberative atmosphere were more negative toward immigrants than classrooms with a higher frequency of discussions, and this effect remained two years after the students moved to new schools. Mediation analysis revealed that general political interest (but not news consumption) explained the effects of classroom discussions on attitudes: Youth who perceived that their teachers frequently initiate political discussions developed higher general political interest and, in turn, lower anti-immigrant attitudes than youth with less frequent discussions. The findings show an important role of classroom political discussions for the formation of intergroup attitudes in adolescence. The findings suggest that frequent discussions reduce the risk of prejudice development by stimulating youth general political interest.","[Miklikowska, Marta; Kudrnac, Ales] Umea Univ, S-90187 Umea, Sweden; [Rekker, Roderik] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Rekker, Roderik] Univ Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden",Umea University; University of Amsterdam; University of Gothenburg,"Miklikowska, M (corresponding author), Umea Univ, S-90187 Umea, Sweden.",miklikowska@gmail.com,,"Miklikowska, Marta/0000-0003-2087-1869; Kudrnac, Ales/0000-0002-3043-7241",Riksbankens Jubileumsfond [P20-0599]; Swedish Research Council [Vetenskapsradet dnr 2016-04165]; Dutch Research Council [VI.Veni.191R.039],Riksbankens Jubileumsfond; Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research CouncilEuropean Commission); Dutch Research Council,This research was supported by grants from the Riksbankens Jubileumsfond [P20-0599]; the Swedish Research Council [Vetenskapsradet dnr 2016-04165]; and the Dutch Research Council [Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek VI.Veni.191R.039].,,102,0,0,7,10,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

After motivating an exploratory research design, we set out to expound: the extent of cross-platform image posting across Facebook and Instagram; the emotion expression of politicians across the two platforms; and the relationship between these emotions and post performance. Our analysis of eight political campaigns (seven Democratic challengers and the Republican incumbent) finds relatively high and stable levels of cross-posting candidate pictures across the two platforms. The exception is the incumbent campaign, where cross-posting activity rose in proximity to the primary elections. Regarding emotions, we utilize both computer vision and crowd coding to identify happiness as the dominant emotion on Facebook and Instagram. Overall, we detect little variation in candidate emotion expressions - across campaigns and across platforms. However, we do find differences in how platform audiences respond to emotions, proxied here through post performance. Results from binomial logistic regressions show that in comparison with Calm, posts exhibiting Anger are less likely to overperform on both Facebook and Instagram. Most interestingly, we find diverging patterns for Happiness, which performs better than Calm on Instagram but not on Facebook. We interpret these findings to suggest first, that Instagram users reward emotionality from politicians. Second and more importantly, we argue that differing audience responses to emotions - captured through social media metrics - may reveal a generation polarization in what different segments of the electorate prefer their political leaders to be.","[Bossetta, Michael] Lund Univ, Dept Commun & Media, Helgonabacken 12, S-22362 Lund, Sweden; [Schmokel, Rasmus] Univ Southern Denmark, Digital Democracy Ctr, Odense, Denmark",Lund University; University of Southern Denmark,"Bossetta, M (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Dept Commun & Media, Helgonabacken 12, S-22362 Lund, Sweden.",michael.bossetta@kom.lu.se,,"Bossetta, Michael/0000-0002-8611-5487",Vinnova (Sweden's Innovation Agency) [Self-FX: Self-effects on Social Media and Political Polarization] [2019-02151],Vinnova (Sweden's Innovation Agency) [Self-FX: Self-effects on Social Media and Political Polarization],"This work was supported by Vinnova (Sweden's Innovation Agency) [Self-FX: Self-effects on Social Media and Political Polarization, 2019-02151].",,32,0,0,8,8,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

While news media cannot deliver policy on their own, they are fully equipped to represent, interpret, and amplify grievance. If disaffection is directed at retribution rather than policy, journalism contributes to backsliding in the further pathologizing of (non)-responsive government. This essay proposes critical realism (CR) as a heuristic for conceptualizing unique contributions of news media to backsliding. Reality consists of layered strata in CR. This approach accepts the premise of news as a social construction but maintains that a domain of reality exists independent of discursive representation, and that this realm can be actualized in ways that are damaging to democracy. Applied to political communication, the domain of the real includes democratic deficits that may or may not become actualized depending on how journalism operates at the empirical level. Critical realism also generates insights applicable to reform. CR insists that journalists avoid reifying sentiment in ways that comfort authoritarians. The diagnostic acknowledges the journalistic conviction that an external reality is knowable, positing nevertheless that the news interacts with underlying social forces. The profession must forge a healthier relationship with the public to avoid reifying audience support for anti-democratic norms. Reflexivity could be directed beyond the recognition of complicity to two productive rationales for safeguarding democracy: liberal multiculturalism and journalistic paternalism.

These dual trends raise the important question of how people's online political participation is connected to perceptions of their own capacity to participate in and influence politics. The current study overcomes the limitation of scarce high-quality cross-national and over-time data on these topics by conducting a meta-analysis of all extant studies that analyze how political efficacy relates to both online and offline political participation using data sources in which all variables were measured simultaneously. We identified and coded 48 relevant studies (with 184 effects) representing 51,860 respondents from 28 countries based on surveys conducted between 2000 and 2016. We conducted a multilevel random effects meta-analysis to test the main hypothesis of whether political efficacy has a weaker relationship with online political participation than offline political participation. The findings show positive relationships between efficacy and both forms of participation, with no distinction in the magnitude of the two associations. In addition, we tested hypotheses about the expected variation across time and democratic contexts, and the results suggest contextual variation for offline participation but cross-national stability for online participation. The findings provide the most comprehensive evidence to date that online participation is as highly associated with political efficacy as offline participation, and that the strength of this association for online political participation is stable over time and across diverse country contexts.","[Oser, Jennifer] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Polit & Govt, Beer Sheva, Israel; [Grinson, Amit] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Sociol & Anthropol, Beer Sheva, Israel; [Boulianne, Shelley] MacEwan Univ, Sociol, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Halperin, Eran] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Psychol, Jerusalem, Israel",Ben Gurion University; Ben Gurion University; Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"Oser, J (corresponding author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Polit & Govt, Beer Sheva, Israel.",oser@post.bgu.ac.il,"Oser, Jennifer/AAC-4253-2019","Oser, Jennifer/0000-0002-1531-4606",Israel Science Foundation [1246/20]; European Research Council [335607],Israel Science Foundation(Israel Science Foundation); European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)European Commission),This research was funded by the Israel Science Foundation [grant 1246/20 to Jennifer Oser]; and by the European Research Council [grant 335607 to Eran Halperin].,,125,1,1,17,17,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

However, empirical study about the relationship between political ideologies and lifestyle choices is limited by a lack of comprehensive data. In this research, we combine survey and Facebook Page likes data from more than 1,200 respondents to investigate the extent of polarization in lifestyle domains. Our results indicate that polarization is present in page categories that are somewhat related to politics - such as opinion leaders, partisan news sources, and topics related to identity and religion - but, perhaps surprisingly, it is mostly not evident in other domains, including sports, food, and music. On the individual level, we find that people who are higher in political news interest and have stronger ideological predispositions have a greater tendency to like ideologically homogeneous pages across categories. Our evidence, drawn from rare digital trace data covering more than 5,000 pages, adds nuance to the narrative of widespread polarization across lifestyle sectors and it suggests domains in which cross-cutting preferences are still observed in American life.","[Praet, Stiene] Univ Antwerp, Dept Engn Management, Antwerp, Belgium; [Praet, Stiene; Guess, Andrew M.; Tucker, Joshua A.; Bonneau, Richard; Nagler, Jonathan] NYU, Ctr Social Media & Polit, New York, NY USA; [Guess, Andrew M.] Princeton Univ, Dept Polit, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Tucker, Joshua A.; Nagler, Jonathan] NYU, Wilf Family Dept Polit, New York, NY USA; [Bonneau, Richard] NYU, Dept Biol, New York, NY 10003 USA",University of Antwerp; New York University; Princeton University; New York University; New York University,"Praet, S (corresponding author), Univ Antwerp, Dept Engn Management, Antwerp, Belgium.",stiene.praet@uantwerp.be,"Bonneau, Richard/GZL-2900-2022; Guess, Andrew/J-4904-2019","Guess, Andrew/0000-0003-2974-7848",Charles Koch Foundation; Craig Newmark Philanthropies; University of Antwerp [FFB160362BOF GOA]; John S. and James L.

To address this question, this article investigates how Turkish Islamic conservative journalists produced and circulated representations of two dramatic uprisings in 2013: the Gezi Park protests in Turkey and the military coup in Egypt. I chose these two cases because the Islamic political bias and activism that shaped the production of news about these two events are symptomatic of the way in which Islamism as a political ideology instrumentalizes news making. Based on newsroom ethnography conducted at an Islamic national mainstream television channel in Turkey between 2011 and 2014, the article demonstrates how Islamism shapes the ways in which Islamic conservative journalists interpreted and articulated the two events in the newsroom, and represented them in news coverage. In this context, journalistic practice gains an ideological character when the journalists utilize journalistic representations as strategic instruments to advance the political agenda of Islamic conservatives against secular forces in Turkey. As the polarization between Islamic and secular groups is based on cultural distinctions, I argue that the political ideology determining journalistic practices is defined not only by party affiliations or socioeconomic class positions but also by the common cultural ways of living and thinking of journalists who work and live as members of a sociocultural group. Islamic ideology serves as a social cement that creates bonds among the IslamicTV journalists as a sociocultural group, and a degree of unity and common purpose in their professional practices.","[Asik, Ozan] Bursa Uludag Univ, Fen Edebiyat Fak, Sosyol Bolumu, TR-16059 Bursa, Turkey",Uludag University,"Asik, O (corresponding author), Bursa Uludag Univ, Fen Edebiyat Fak, Sosyol Bolumu, TR-16059 Bursa, Turkey.",m.ozan.asik@gmail.com,,"ASIK, MEHMET OZAN/0000-0002-5588-2376",,,,,56,0,0,0,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1940-1612,1940-1620,,INT J PRESS/POLIT,Int.

Young people are at the forefront, with social media serving both as mobilizing tools and expressive spaces. Drawing upon literature on youth and digital activism with a generational, situated approach, we account for how both the climate struggle and social media are appropriated by FFF-activists as part of their own youth grassroots politics. Moreover, we explore the activities they mix and the strategies they adopt when moving across online and offline environments. From July 2020 to January 2021, we carried out 6 months of ethnographic work with(in) the FFF-Rome group by blending participant observation of assemblies and protests with digital ethnography on the homonym WhatsApp group. Results' thematic analysis shows that FFF-activists believe climate activism to be their own fight and social media their own battlefield. A generational understanding of digital climate activism emerges at the intersection of the appropriation of the dispute (climate change) and the digital environments (social media). Findings also account for broader logics and strategies adopted by FFF-activists, on and beyond social media. They move seamlessly between online and offline, spanning across and negotiating with different platforms according to political goals and target audiences. These results contribute to overcoming reductive or marginalizing approaches to youth activism, to legitimizing and situating young activists' social media usage practices within an array of grassroots political practices, and to understanding how generational belonging affects such practices in the Italian context.","[Belotti, Francesca; Bussoletti, Arianna; Comunello, Francesca] Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Commun & Social Res, Via Salaria 3, I-0085 Rome, Italy; [Donato, Stellamarina] LUMSA Univ, Dept Human Sci, Rome, Italy",Sapienza University Rome; Universita LUMSA,"Belotti, F (corresponding author), Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Commun & Social Res, Via Salaria 3, I-0085 Rome, Italy.",frabelo@hotmail.it,"Donato, Stellamarina/AEW-5860-2022","Donato, Stellamarina/0000-0003-2382-3950; Belotti, Francesca/0000-0002-7335-2686; Bussoletti, Arianna/0000-0003-3179-5013; COMUNELLO, Francesca/0000-0001-5845-5807",Sapienza University of Rome [AR220172B3EAE688],Sapienza University of Rome,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the Sapienza University of Rome, funding for Early Research Projects -Type 2 (Sapienza Universita di Roma) (Protocol No: AR220172B3EAE688).",,65,1,1,8,17,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1940-1612,1940-1620,,INT J PRESS/POLIT,Int.

We analyze two decades of reporting on PICC in American, British, and Australian newspapers-looking at both volume and content of coverage-and expand the quantitative results with semi-structured interviews with journalists and Pacific stakeholders.

We explore a possible nexus between these two phenomena by means of a model that extends some recent developments in the empirical spatial theory of voting to the reader's choice with respect to newspapers. We assume that ideological proximity to a newspaper affects the choice made by a consumer to read it. Newspapers will then compete among themselves to maximize their respective readerships by finding an optimal placement in the ideological space. However, newspapers can also decide to target readers of a specific type. As we will show, this is a crucial step to take into consideration. We empirically apply our model to the Italian case. We show that Italian newspapers appear largely to behave as theoretically expected. However, the ideological force behind this conclusion must be sought in newspapers' competition with respect to that subset of readers which can be identified as regular ones. This result highlights a possible mechanism driving a persistent newspaper ideological slant in time of lower newspaper circulation.","[Curini, Luigi] Univ Milan, Dept Social & Polit Sci, Polit Sci, Milan, Italy",University of Milan,"Curini, L (corresponding author), Univ Milan, Dept Social & Polit Sci, Via Conservatorio 7, I-20122 Milan, Italy.",luigi.curini@unimi.it,"Curini, Luigi/D-9441-2017","Curini, Luigi/0000-0003-1974-9815",,,,,48,1,1,0,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1940-1612,1940-1620,,INT J PRESS/POLIT,Int.

Here, scholarship has largely focused on the covert strategies of the Russia-based Internet Research Agency and the overt strategies of Russia's largest international broadcaster RT (Russia Today). But since 2017, a number of new news media providers linked to the Russian state have emerged, and less research has focused on these channels and how they may support contemporary influence operations. We conduct a qualitative content analysis of 2,014 Facebook posts about the #BlackLivesMatter (BLM) protests in the United States over the summer of 2020 to comparatively examine the overt propaganda strategies of six Russian-linked news organizations-RT, Ruptly, Soapbox, In The NOW, Sputnik, and Redfish. We found that RT and Sputnik diverged in their framing of the BLM movement from the newer media properties. RT and Sputnik primarily produced negative coverage of the BLM movement, painting protestors as violent, or discussed the hypocrisy of racial justice in America. In contrast, newer media properties like In The NOW, Soapbox, and Redfish supported the BLM movement with clickbait-style videos highlighting racism in America. Video footage bearing the Ruptly brandmark appears in both traditional and new media properties, to illustrate, in real time, civil unrest across the US. By focusing on overt propaganda from the broad array of Russian-affiliated media, our data allows us to further understand the full spectrum and counter-hegemonic strategies at play in contemporary information operations.","[Bradshaw, Samantha; DiResta, Renee; Miller, Carly] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University,"Bradshaw, S (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Ctr Democracy Dev & Rule Law, Encina Hall, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",sam.r.bradshaw@gmail.com,,"Bradshaw, Samantha/0000-0001-5305-369X",,,,,70,0,0,3,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1940-1612,1940-1620,,INT J PRESS/POLIT,Int.

We examine how television news reported who was responsible for making policies across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland during the coronavirus pandemic. Drawing on a content analysis study of five UK television news bulletins (N = 181), we found that reporting did not regularly attribute political responsibility to all four governments of the UK at the start of the pandemic. Once the nations began to adopt different lockdown measures the clarity of reporting legislative decisions improved, but there were still missed opportunities to clarify which government was responsible for specific policies. By way of conclusion, we argue that scholars examining how the media report political responsibility need to find creative ways of theorising and empirically studying informational opportunities in order to enhance public understanding.","[Cushion, Stephen; Carbis, Llion] Two Cent Sq,Cent Sq, Cardiff CF10 1FS, Wales",,"Cushion, S (corresponding author), Two Cent Sq,Cent Sq, Cardiff CF10 1FS, Wales.",Cushionsa@Cardiff.ac.uk,,"Cushion, Stephen/0000-0001-7164-8283",Arts and Humanities Research Council [AH/S012508/1],Arts and Humanities Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC)),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the Arts and Humanities Research Council (grant number AH/S012508/1).",,28,0,0,2,2,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1940-1612,1940-1620,,INT J PRESS/POLIT,Int.

We examine the extent to which each avenue promotes news exposure and also exposes users to news sources that are left leaning, right leaning, and centrist. When combined with information on individual political leanings, we show the extent of dissimilar, centrist, or congenial exposure resulting from each avenue. We rely on web browsing history records from 636 social media users in the US paired with survey self-reports, a unique data set that allows us to examine both aggregate and individual-level exposure. Visits to news websites account for about 2 percent of the total number of visits to URLs and are unevenly distributed among users.

Content collected in the spring of 2021 illuminated two very distinct foci of discussion about news representations of protest: the Black Lives Matter movement and the Capitol riot. Our qualitative content analysis of TikTok videos and their related comments demonstrates how users employed TikTok's creative affordances to dissect specific news representations, critique the media apparatus, and expand news narratives. These findings shed light on the complex role of TikTok as a platform for media criticism-one that can be used for both democratic and non-democratic ends.","[Literat, Ioana] Columbia Univ, Commun Media & Learning Technol Design Program, Teachers Coll, Columbia, SC USA; [Literat, Ioana] Columbia Univ, Media & Social Change Lab, Teachers Coll, Columbia, SC USA; [Boxman-Shabtai, Lillian] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Commun & Journalism, Jerusalem, Israel; [Kligler-Vilenchik, Neta] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Commun & Journalism, Jerusalem, Israel; [Kligler-Vilenchik, Neta] Stanford Univ, Ctr Adv Study Behav Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Columbia University; Columbia University; Hebrew University of Jerusalem; Hebrew University of Jerusalem; Stanford University,"Literat, I (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Teachers Coll, 525 W 120th St,Box 019, New York, NY 10027 USA.",literat@tc.columbia.edu,,"Kligler-Vilenchik, Neta/0000-0003-3470-3305; Literat, Ioana/0000-0001-8192-769X",,,,,41,0,0,11,11,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1940-1612,1940-1620,,INT J PRESS/POLIT,Int.

The analysis is based on a 2018 evaluation of one index based in the United States - the Ranking Digital Rights Index, which assesses privacy and freedom of expression in the ICT space - and incorporates interviews with civil society stakeholders. Bringing theory from the fields of journalism and social movements together with the data from the evaluation, the findings suggest indices can serve as useful communication resources for social movements under certain circumstances.

Capturing both positive and negative forms of civility (i.e., recognition and outrage) on multiple levels of analysis, we compile and analyze an original large-scale dataset of news items published during August 2015 until July 2016 in six democracies (Australia, Germany, Lebanon, Switzerland, Turkey, and the USA) across three types of media (printed newspapers, news websites, and political blogs). We find that mediated discourse was heavier on outrage in mixed political systems (Germany and Turkey) than in 'purely' majoritarian and consensus systems. Public debate in deeply divided countries contained more outrage but also more recognition compared to less divided countries, with newspapers and news websites mitigating outrage discourse compared to political blogs. Blogs also emerged as less nurturing of recognition than newspapers and news websites.","[Loeb, Charlotte] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Dept Commun, Jakob Welder Weg 12, D-55099 Mainz, Germany; [Rinke, Eike Mark] Univ Leeds, Sch Polit & Int Studies, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Weinmann, Carina] Heinrich Heine Univ Dusseldorf, Dept Social Sci, Dusseldorf, Germany; [Wessler, Hartmut] Univ Mannheim, Inst Media & Commun Studies, Mannheim, Germany",Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz; University of Leeds; Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf; University of Mannheim,"Lob, C (corresponding author), Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Dept Commun, Jakob Welder Weg 12, D-55099 Mainz, Germany.",charlotte.loeb@uni-mainz.de,"Rinke, Eike/GWZ-8265-2022","Weinmann, Carina/0000-0002-8501-5484; Lob, Charlotte/0000-0002-5874-6986; Wessler, Hartmut/0000-0003-4216-5471; Rinke, Eike Mark/0000-0002-5330-7634",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) [WE 2888/6-1],Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG), (grant number WE 2888/6-1).",,54,0,0,3,4,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1940-1612,1940-1620,,INT J PRESS/POLIT,Int.

While the rise of digital media may have enabled more differences to be articulated, common ground is often seen as threatened by fragmentation of political debate, which some see as driven by news media. The relative importance of political actors (parties and politicians) in driving fragmentation has received less attention. In this paper, we compare how news media and political actors contribute to the fragmentation of online political debate on the basis of analysis of almost half a million election-related tweets collected during the 2017 French, German, and U.K. national elections. We employ a structural topic model to reduce online political debate to networks of topic overlap. Across the three countries with different political and media systems, we find news media are by far the most important actors in terms of creating and maintaining a common space of online political debate on Twitter. Our results also show that political actors, with some variation from country to country, contribute more to fragmentation as they focus on different topics while articulating clear differences. These findings underline the importance of complementing structural analysis of the rise of digital and social media with analysis of how important elite actors like news media and political parties/candidates use these media in different ways. Overall, we show how at least on Twitter, across three different countries with different media systems and political systems, news media create connection that contributes to commonality while political actors lay out clear differences that drive fragmentation.","[Heiberger, Raphael] Univ Stuttgart, Inst Social Sci, Stuttgart, Germany; [Majo-Vazquez, Silvia; Nielsen, Rasmus K.] Univ Oxford, Reuters Inst Study Journalism, 13 Norham Gardens, Oxford OX2 6PS, England; [Castro Herrero, Laia; Esser, Frank] Univ Zurich, Dept Commun & Media Res, Zurich, Switzerland",University of Stuttgart; University of Oxford; University of Zurich,"Majo-Vazquez, S (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Reuters Inst Study Journalism, 13 Norham Gardens, Oxford OX2 6PS, England.",silvia.majo-vazquez@politics.ox.ac.uk,,"Majo-Vazquez, Silvia/0000-0002-2312-7907; Castro Herrero, Laia/0000-0001-6281-0365",Google,Google(Google Incorporated),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by Google (grant no.

Press accounts and scholarship have suggested these message boards help to radicalize like-minded users through exposure to shared media insulated from cross-cutting viewpoints (e.g., Hine et al. 2017; Palmer 2019). To better understand what role online message boards might play for supporters of right-wing populist movements, we focus on the Spanish political party Vox and its supporters' use of the message board ForoCoches, a fan site for car enthusiasts, which became an important platform for the party. Using more than 120,000 messages collected from threads mentioning the party between 2013-2019, we examine the URLs shared to show how mainstream news media events shape the conversation online and how users not only were exposed but deeply engaged with cross-cutting news sources. We argue that the use of sites such as ForoCoches should be viewed in the context of a broader increasingly hybrid political and media landscape where activity online and offline cannot be understood separate from one another. Moreover, our findings suggest that the online political discussions that take place in Vox-related threads on ForoCoches resemble normatively positive deliberative spaces-albeit in this case in support of illiberal political positions. In other words, our findings complicate conventional notions about the benefits of political talk, especially online, as a democratically desirable end in and of itself.","[Miro, Clara Juarez; Toff, Benjamin] Univ Minnesota, Hubbard Sch Journalism & Mass Commun, 206 Church St SE, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Miro, CJ (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Hubbard Sch Journalism & Mass Commun, 206 Church St SE, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",juare085@umn.edu,,"Juarez Miro, Clara/0000-0002-6626-6317",,,,,71,0,0,1,8,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1940-1612,1940-1620,,INT J PRESS/POLIT,Int.

Drawing from 2017-20 World Value Survey and Varieties of Democracy project data, we conducted multilevel analyses across forty-four countries from seven continents that have different political and media systems. Results showed that online news and online surveillance were positively related to political engagement while online censorship was negatively related. Cross-level interactions also showed some support for the informational theory of repression, whereby the relationships among online news, surveillance, and engagement were conditioned at different levels of online censorship. The results suggest that while country-level online surveillance and censorship is highly correlated, varying levels can engender or suppress political engagement in different ways, which have implications for future studies on the dynamics of government digital repression and citizen participation in politics from a global comparative perspective.","[Chan, Michael; Yi, Jingjing; Kuznetsov, Dmitry] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Sch Journalism Commun, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Chinese University of Hong Kong,"Chan, M (corresponding author), Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Sch Journalism & Commun, New Asia Coll, Shatin, Humanities Bldg, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",mcmchan@cuhk.edu.hk,"Chan, Michael/A-9477-2013","Chan, Michael/0000-0001-9911-593X",,,,,52,0,0,10,10,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1940-1612,1940-1620,,INT J PRESS/POLIT,Int.

Several of the most methodologically sound studies find small to nonexistent effects. However, extant research is limited by focusing on few platforms (usually Facebook, Twitter or YouTube) and is heavily U.S. centered. This leaves open the possibility that other platforms, such as those that rely on visual communication (e.g., Instagram) or are tailored to strong-tie network communication (e.g., WhatsApp), are more influential. Furthermore, the few studies conducted in other countries suggest that social media use increases political misperceptions. Still, these works use cross-sectional designs, which are ill suited to dealing with omitted variable bias and temporal ordering of processes. Using a two-wave survey fielded in Mexico during the 2021 midterm elections (N = 596), we estimate the relationship between frequency of news exposure on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram and WhatsApp, and belief in political misinformation, while controlling for both time-invariant and time-dependent individual differences. I n contrast to political discussion, information literacy and digital skills, none of the social platforms analyzed exhibits a significant association with misinformed beliefs. We also tested for possible indirect, moderated, and reciprocal relationships, but none of these analyses yielded a statistically significant result. We conclude that the study is consistent with the minimal media effects paradigm, which suggests that efforts to address misinformation need to go beyond social platforms.","[Valenzuela, Sebastian] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Commun, Santiago, Chile; [Valenzuela, Sebastian; Santos, Marcelo] Millennium Inst Fdn Res Data IMFD, Santiago, Chile; [Muniz, Carlos] Univ Autonoma Nuevo Leon, Fac Polit Sci & Int Relat, Monterrey, Mexico; [Santos, Marcelo] Univ Diego Portales, Sch Commun, Santiago, Chile",Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile; Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon; University Diego Portales,"Valenzuela, S (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Comunicac, Oficina 713, Santiago 8331150, Chile.",savalenz@uc.cl,"Santos, Marcelo/AAQ-6203-2021; Muñiz, Carlos/D-2415-2016; Valenzuela, Sebastián/AAA-7308-2020","Santos, Marcelo/0000-0002-2658-3764; Muñiz, Carlos/0000-0002-9021-8198; Valenzuela, Sebastián/0000-0001-5991-7364",CONACYT (Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia) Mexico [280739]; Chile's National Research and Development Agency (ANID) [ICN17_002],CONACYT (Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia) Mexico(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)); Chile's National Research and Development Agency (ANID),"This work was funded by CONACYT (Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia) Mexico [grant 280739, Analisis de la cobertura mediatica de las campanas electorales y su impacto en la desafeccion politica y el compromiso democratico ciudadano, PI Carlos Muniz].

We also collected over 30,000 news articles from major news sources in English-speaking countries (Australia, Canada, United States, United Kingdom) to demonstrate how climate movement actors and media differ in their framing of this issue, attention to policy solutions, attribution of blame, and efforts to mobilize citizens to act on this issue. News outlets tend to report on global politicians' (in)action toward climate policy, the consequences of climate change, and industry's response to the climate crisis. Differently, climate movement actors on Twitter advocate for political actions and policy changes as well as addressing the social justice issues surrounding climate change. We also revealed that conversations around the climate movement on Twitter are highly politicized, with a substantial number of tweets targeting politicians, partisans, and country actors. These findings contribute to our understanding of how people use social media to frame political issues and collective action, in comparison to the traditional mainstream news outlets.","[Chen, Kaiping] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Life Sci Commun, Computat Commun, Madison, WI USA; [Molder, Amanda L.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Life Sci Commun, Madison, WI USA; [Duan, Zening] Univ Wisconsin, Sch Journalism & Mass Commun, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Boulianne, Shelley] MacEwan Univ, Dept Sociol, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Eckart, Christopher; Mallari, Prince] Georgia Inst Technol, Comp Sci, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Yang, Diyi] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Interact Comp, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology,"Boulianne, S (corresponding author), MacEwan Univ, 6-394 City Ctr Campus,10700-204 Ave, Edmonton, AB, Canada.",bouliannes@macewan.ca,,"Chen, Kaiping/0000-0002-5864-5333; Molder, Amanda/0000-0001-8429-7339",University of Wisconsin Madison Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research and Graduate Education; Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation; Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research and Graduate Education at the University of Wisconsin-Madison,University of Wisconsin Madison Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research and Graduate Education; Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation; Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research and Graduate Education at the University of Wisconsin-Madison,"Chen, Molder, and Duan contributed equally to this paper.

This has resulted in a preponderance of research endeavors that have sought to understand this phenomenon through ideas that are pertinent, perhaps solely to those contexts, and not as applicable outside, particularly in the Global South. This has potentially limited our imagination into various other ways in which audience fragmentation can manifest in these often-overlooked countries. In this paper, I use the case of online India as an example to offer a theoretical framework - that of news reading publics - for understanding audience fragmentation as a more global socio-political phenomenon that allows for rigorous comparative research, without being restrictive in scope. I draw from existing theories in communication and related disciplines and show how such a framework can be situated within existing social science theory. I argue that this framework should make us think of audience fragmentation in western contexts to be special cases of a more general model. I also show how network analysis can be used as a context-agnostic tool for identifying news reading publics and demonstrate the utility of such a method in complementing this theoretical framework. Finally, I discuss potential future research directions that this framework generates.","[Mukerjee, Subhayan] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Commun & New Media, Singapore, Singapore",National University of Singapore,"Mukerjee, S (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, Fac Arts & Social Sci, Dept Commun & New Media, Blk AS6,13 Comp Dr, Singapore 117416, Singapore.",mukerjee@nus.edu.sg,"Mukerjee, Subhayan/AAK-6864-2020","Mukerjee, Subhayan/0000-0002-1885-5440",NSF [1729412],NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"The author would like to thank Prof. Sandra Gonzalez-Bailon and student members of the DiMeNet and DIG research groups at the University of Pennsylvania for helpful feedback on this work.

Yet, this focus on the challenging aspects of political talk has been informed predominantly by the US context. To what extent may a different picture emerge when looking across different cultural contexts? And how are these dynamics shaped by the affordances of the multi-platform social media environment? This paper explores these questions through a unique dataset of 122 qualitative interviews conducted between 2016 and 2019 with young people (ages 18-29) from five countries: Argentina, Finland, Israel, Japan, and the United States. Rather than solidifying the avoidance of controversial political talk as the key strategy at the disposal of young people, our findings point at a five-pronged typology of young people, with each type representing a different approach toward political talk. Our typology thus contributes to a more comprehensive and nuanced picture of various approaches towards political talk employed by young people across different countries and in relation to different digital media affordances.","[Kligler-Vilenchik, Neta; Tenenboim-Weinblatt, Keren] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Commun & Journalism, Jerusalem, Israel; [Boczkowski, Pablo J.] Northwestern Univ, Commun Studies, Evanston, IL USA; [Hayashi, Kaori] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Interdisciplinary Informat Studies, Tokyo, Japan; [Mitchelstein, Eugenia] Univ San Andres, Ciencias Sociales, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Villi, Mikko] Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Language & Commun Studies, Jyvaskyla, Finland",Hebrew University of Jerusalem; Northwestern University; University of Tokyo; Universidad de San Andres Argentina; University of Jyvaskyla,"Kligler-Vilenchik, N (corresponding author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Commun & Journalism, IL-919050 Mt Scopus, Israel.",neta.kv@mail.huji.ac.il,,"Mitchelstein, Eugenia/0000-0001-7355-8740; Kligler-Vilenchik, Neta/0000-0003-3470-3305; Villi, Mikko/0000-0001-6935-9386",Helsinging Sanomat Foundation; JSPS KAKENHI [17H01833]; Global Partnership Fund of the Buffett Institute for Global Studies at Northwestern University,"Helsinging Sanomat Foundation; JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Global Partnership Fund of the Buffett Institute for Global Studies at Northwestern University","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the Helsinging Sanomat Foundation, JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number 17H01833, and the Global Partnership Fund of the Buffett Institute for Global Studies at Northwestern University.",,37,1,1,12,16,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1940-1612,1940-1620,,INT J PRESS/POLIT,Int.

First, we explore how climate change is communicated on social media by youth activists, and then examine these concepts through the unique case of Thunberg's Instagram. Then, through qualitative content analysis, this study elucidates her communication strategy by applying the concept of framing to unpack how she frames climate change as a moral and ethical issue, uses an emotional appeal of hope, and visually frames motivational collective action to mobilize her audience. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings to explore the complexities of communicating climate change through social media and how Thunberg's activism on Instagram may provide an example for future generations.","[Molder, Amanda L.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Life Sci Commun, 1545 Observ Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Lakind, Alexandra] Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Chen, Kaiping] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Life Sci Commun, Computat Commun, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Clemmons, Zoe E.] Barefoot Publ Relat, Denver, CO USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Molder, AL (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Life Sci Commun, 1545 Observ Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",amanda.molder@wisc.edu,"Chen, Kaiping/AAD-7014-2022","Molder, Amanda/0000-0001-8429-7339; Chen, Kaiping/0000-0002-5864-5333","Graduate School, Office of Vice Chancellor for Research and Graduate Education at the University of Wisconsin-Madison; Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation; UW-Madison","Graduate School, Office of Vice Chancellor for Research and Graduate Education at the University of Wisconsin-Madison; Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation; UW-Madison","The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the Graduate School, part of the Office of Vice Chancellor for Research and Graduate Education at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, with funding from the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation and the UW-Madison.",,82,3,3,17,31,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1940-1612,1940-1620,,INT J PRESS/POLIT,Int.

The results show that exposure to falsely balanced reporting largely has a null effect on perceptions of voter fraud, though we also find evidence of partisan-based heterogeneity in its effect. The results of the study also show that explicit journalistic intervention equally decreases belief in voter fraud among both Democrats and Republicans before the election, but among Republicans the corrective effect of intervention disappears in the post-election period, suggesting that there are sharp contextual limits on the effect of explicit journalistic intervention.","[Jenkins, Matthew David] Gyeongsang Natl Univ, Dept Polit Sci & Diplomacy, Jinju 151324, Gyeongsangnam D, South Korea; [Gomez, Daniel] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Polit Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",Gyeongsang National University; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara,"Jenkins, MD (corresponding author), Gyeongsang Natl Univ, Dept Polit Sci & Diplomacy, Jinju 151324, Gyeongsangnam D, South Korea.",mjenkins@gnu.ac.kr,,"Jenkins, Matthew/0000-0002-3999-2591",Gyeongsang National University,Gyeongsang National University,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the Gyeongsang National University (grant number Social Sciences).",,62,0,0,1,1,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1940-1612,1940-1620,,INT J PRESS/POLIT,Int.

Taking German refugee policy as our case in point we map the role that moral, ethical-cultural, legal, and pragmatic argumentations play within journalistic, partisan, and activist outlets; and how these coincide with incivility and impoliteness. Using dictionary-based content analysis on a data set of 34,819 articles from thirty online news outlets published between April 10, 2017, and April 10, 2018, we find that legacy mainstream media, partisan media, and activist media perform vastly different functions for the larger public sphere. We observe that human rights activist media perform an advocatory function by making the moral case for refugees, whereas corrosive partisan media at the fringe-particularly within the contra-refugee camp-often present opponents as inherently illegitimate enemies.

During the first wave of Covid-19, right-wing followers claimed that Muslims were spreading the virus to perform Jihad. We analyzed a sample of 7000 tweets using Critical Discourse Analysis to examine how the online disinformation accusing Muslims in India was initiated and sustained. We identify three critical discourse strategies used on Twitter to spread and sustain the anti-Muslim (dis)information: (1) creating mediatized hate solidarities, (2) appropriating instruments of legitimacy, and (3) practicing Internet Hindu vigilantism. Each strategy consists of a subset of discursive toolkits, highlighting the central routes of discursive engagement to produce disinformation online. We argue that understanding how the technical affordances of Social Networking Sites are leveraged in quotidian online practices to produce and sustain the phenomenon of online disinformation will prove to be a novel contribution to the field of disinformation studies and Internet research.","[Bhatia, Kiran Vinod] Univ Wisconsin, Sch Journalism & Mass Commun, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Arora, Payal] Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam, Netherlands",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Bhatia, KV (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Sch Journalism & Mass Commun, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",kvbhatia2@wisc.edu,,"Bhatia, Kiran/0000-0002-6205-7104",,,,,34,1,1,4,4,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1940-1612,1940-1620,,INT J PRESS/POLIT,Int.

For example, political interest is more strongly correlated with media trust for Millennials than for other generations. Perceptions of bias and inaccuracy have a strong negative correlation with media trust overall, but it is stronger for older generations. These results suggest, that in the long term, societal developments, and in particular debates about media bias and misinformation may impact media trust of young generations differently as they grow older-however, our data give no indication of that creating generational gaps in media trust.","[Brosius, Anna; Ohme, Jakob; de Vreese, Claes H.] Amsterdam Sch Commun Res, Nieuwe Achtergracht 166, NL-1018 WV Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam,"Brosius, A (corresponding author), Amsterdam Sch Commun Res, Nieuwe Achtergracht 166, NL-1018 WV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",a.brosius@uva.nl,,"Brosius, Anna/0000-0002-9312-2837",European Research Council (ERC) [647316],European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)European Commission),"The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research is funded by a grant from the European Research Council (ERC), grant number 647316.",,66,2,2,12,32,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1940-1612,1940-1620,,INT J PRESS/POLIT,Int.

We find that news consumption gaps are either stable or converge throughout the campaign. Importantly, social media provides political information to those groups that use traditional media channels the least and thereby reduce overall gaps in political media consumption.

Politicians use conflict framing in their online messages (e.g., criticizing other politicians) and journalists in their political coverage (e.g., reporting on political tensions). Conflicts can take a variety of forms and can provoke different reactions. However, the literature still lacks a systematic and theoretically-grounded conceptual framework that accounts for the multi-dimensionality of political conflict frames. Based on literature from political epistemology, political communication, and related fields such as psychology, we present four conceptual dimensions of political conflicts: (1) the style (civil/uncivil); (2) the subject (personal/substantive); (3) whether it is about underlying moral/epistemic principles or not (deep/superficial conflict); and (4) whether it concerns a normative or factual issue. Results of a content analysis of newspaper articles and politicians' tweets confirm the usage of these conflict dimensions in the Netherlands during a non-election period. Interestingly, most of the conflicts are civil, substantive, and do not highlight deep fundamental clashes. In light of the current societal concerns about the lack of respect in political debates and the deepening of our political divides, these findings can be considered encouraging.","[van der Goot, Emma] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Commun Res ASCoR, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Vliegenthart, Rens] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Commun Res ASCoR, Media & Soc, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Kruikemeier, Sanne] Wageningen Univ & Res, Strateg Commun Grp, Digital Media & Soc, Wageningen, Netherlands; [de Ridder, Jeroen] Free Univ Amsterdam, Philosophy, Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam; University of Amsterdam; Wageningen University & Research; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"van der Goot, E (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Roeterseilandcampus,Room C 10-00, NL-1018 WV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",e.s.vandergoot@uva.nl,,"van der Goot, Emma/0000-0002-1799-2072","Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek [406, DI.19.055]",Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)European Commission),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, (grant number 406.DI.19.055).",,56,0,0,2,2,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1940-1612,1940-1620,,INT J PRESS/POLIT,Int.

Past research offers unclear conclusions as to whether Latina political candidates face biases due to the intersection of their identities as women and as ethnic minorities, and how Latinas can navigate such biases. In this study, we identify how Latinas draw on their intersectional identities as both women and ethnic minorities to develop strategic campaign messages and how voters respond to such messages. Through an analysis of campaign advertising data and an original survey experiment, we show that Latina candidates do not face an automatic disadvantage based in gender and ethnic biases, but they can benefit from the intersection of these two identities, especially among female minority voters. These results are consequential because they offer insights into how to improve the descriptive and substantive representation of marginalized groups in the U.S.","[Santia, Martina; Bauer, Nichole M.] Louisiana State Univ, Manship Sch Mass Commun, 211 Journalism Bldg, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Bauer, Nichole M.] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA",Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University; Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University,"Santia, M (corresponding author), Louisiana State Univ, Manship Sch Mass Commun, 211 Journalism Bldg, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.",msanti4@lsu.edu,,"Santia, Martina/0000-0002-2097-7674",,,,,84,0,0,1,3,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1940-1612,1940-1620,,INT J PRESS/POLIT,Int.

A public service view of local newspapers predicts that a robust local newspaper sector would mitigate the politicized national partisan rhetoric surrounding COVID-19; reducing the disparity in social-distancing behaviors between predominantly Republican and predominantly Democratic counties by increasing compliance in Republican counties. The alternative hypothesis, informed by a demand-side view of the market pressures local newspapers face, predicts that increased competition between local newspapers will increase the degree to which local newspapers amplify the rhetoric of national officials in line with the partisan composition of their community, further polarizing adherence to social-distancing behaviors across predominantly Republican versus predominantly Democratic counties. The results of this analysis offer strong support for the second hypothesis; but, an additional analysis of vaccination rates offers a more nuanced perspective than a simple public service versus demand-side dichotomy would imply.","[Bailard, Catie Snow] George Washington Univ, Sch Media & Publ Affairs, 805 21st St NW,Suite 400, Washington, DC 20052 USA",George Washington University,"Bailard, CS (corresponding author), George Washington Univ, Sch Media & Publ Affairs, 805 21st St NW,Suite 400, Washington, DC 20052 USA.",cbailard@gwu.edu,,"Bailard, Catie/0000-0003-3135-9473",,,,,55,0,0,3,8,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1940-1612,1940-1620,,INT J PRESS/POLIT,Int.

We combine panel surveys taken before and during the first nation-wide lockdown with webtracking data of participants' online behaviour to paint a nuanced picture of media effects during the crisis. Our work has several findings. First, political trust, an attitude known for its stability, increased following lockdown. Second, consumption of mainstream news on COVID-19 directly hindered this increase, with those reading more news having lower over-time trust, while the relatively minor alternative news consumption had no direct effect on political trust. Third, threat perceptions a) to health and b) from the policy response to the pandemic, have strong and opposite effects on political trust, with threats to health increasing trust, and threats from the government policy response decreasing it. Lastly, these threat perceptions condition the effect of COVID-19 news consumption on political trust: perceptions of threat had the power to both exacerbate and mute the effect of media consumption on government trust during the pandemic. Notably, we show that the expected negative effect of alternative news on political trust only exists for those who did not think COVID-19 posed a threat to their health, while public service news consumption reduced the negative effect produced by government threat perceptions. The paper therefore advances our understanding of the nuanced nature of media effects, particularly as relates to alternative media, especially during moments of crisis.","[de Leon, Ernesto; Makhortykh, Mykola] Univ Bern, Inst Commun & Media Studies, Fabrikstr 8, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Adam, Silke] Univ Bern, Polit Commun, Fabrikstr 8, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Gil-Lopez, Teresa] Univ Koblenz Landau, Koblenz, Germany; [Urman, Aleksandra] Univ Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland",University of Bern; University of Bern; University of Koblenz & Landau; University of Zurich,"de Leon, E (corresponding author), Univ Bern, Inst Commun & Media Studies, Fabrikstr 8, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland.",ernesto.deleon@unibe.ch,"Lopez, Teresa Gil/AAF-5605-2021","Lopez, Teresa Gil/0000-0002-6376-0424; Urman, Aleksandra/0000-0003-3332-9294; Makhortykh, Mykola/0000-0001-7143-5317; de Leon, Ernesto/0000-0003-3152-0722","Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Forderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [100001CL 182630/1, MA 2244/9-1]","Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Forderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Forderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, (grant number 100001CL 182630/1, MA 2244/9-1).",,70,1,1,21,25,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1940-1612,1940-1620,,INT J PRESS/POLIT,Int.

Despite this, there has been little attention given to understanding how NEIBs engage and influence young people in 'Western' democracies. Our article addresses this gap by providing a detailed analysis of RT's English-language, youth-orientated news product ICYMI. Launched in 2018, ICYMI is a social media-based news brand that consists of a series of 2-3-min videos that deliver satirical takes on recent global events including military conflict, financial scandals, and culture clashes. Our findings, which examine the first year of the platform's activity, show that ICYMI is a novel form of engagement, one that is not easily categorised as either public diplomacy or propaganda, nor can it be described as traditional journalism. Instead, we label this approach as geopolitical culture jamming. In this article, we conduct a discourse analysis of 45 videos published on YouTube by ICYMI over its first year to examine how the platform attempts to influence how young people relate to traditional foreign policy discourses. Our empirical analysis centres on how viewers engage with and interpret ICYMI's videos with the aim of addressing how RT may be influencing younger audiences, particularly its core demographic of Anglophone white males whose comments reflect an attachment to ICYMI's populist, anti-elite worldview.","[Saunders, Robert A.; Chatterje-Doody, Precious N.] Farmingdale State Coll, Farmingdale, NY 11735 USA; [Crilley, Rhys] Univ Glasgow, Dept Polit & Int Relat, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; Open Univ, Milton Keynes, Bucks, England",State University of New York (SUNY) System; Farmingdale State College; University of Glasgow; Open University - UK,"Saunders, RA (corresponding author), Farmingdale State Coll, Dept Hist Polit & Geog, 2350 Broadhollow Rd, Farmingdale, NY 11735 USA.",robert.saunders@farmingdale.edu,,"Chatterje-Doody, Precious N/0000-0002-4615-158X; Saunders, Robert/0000-0001-7457-4574",,,,,57,0,0,3,6,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1940-1612,1940-1620,,INT J PRESS/POLIT,Int.

To fill in this gap, the current study examines the long-term relationship between misinformation and trust in the news media. Based on the reinforcing spirals model, we analyzed data from a three-wave panel survey collected in Chile between 2017 and 2019. We found a weak, over-time relationship between misinformation and media skepticism. Specifically, initial beliefs on factually dubious information were negatively correlated with subsequent levels of trust in the news media. Lower trust in the media, in turn, was related over time to higher levels of misinformation. However, we found no evidence of a reverse, parallel process where media trust shielded users against misinformation, further reinforcing trust in the news media. The lack of evidence of a downward spiral suggests that the corrosive effects of misinformation on attitudes toward the news media are less serious than originally suggested. We close with a discussion of directions for future research.","[Valenzuela, Sebastian; Halpern, Daniel; Araneda, Felipe] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Commun, Alameda 340, Santiago 8331150, Chile; [Valenzuela, Sebastian] Millennium Inst Fdn Res Data IMFD, Santiago, Chile",Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile,"Valenzuela, S (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Commun, Alameda 340, Santiago 8331150, Chile.",savalenz@uc.cl,"Valenzuela, Sebastián/AAA-7308-2020","Valenzuela, Sebastián/0000-0001-5991-7364; Araneda, Felipe/0000-0001-7068-5250","Agencia Nacional de Investigacion y Desarrollo of Chile (ANID-Millennium Science Initiative Program) [ANID-Fondecyt-1181600, ICN17_002]",Agencia Nacional de Investigacion y Desarrollo of Chile (ANID-Millennium Science Initiative Program),"The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the Agencia Nacional de Investigacion y Desarrollo of Chile (ANID-Fondecyt-1181600, ANID-Millennium Science Initiative Program-ICN17_002).",,59,9,9,9,21,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1940-1612,1940-1620,,INT J PRESS/POLIT,Int.

This study first identifies and then codes the main frames in all reports about domestic protest in the United Kingdom. Analysing data that covers eight national newspapers during a 26 year period (N = 27,496), I provide a more systematic understanding of how the mainstream news media in liberal democracies report about protests. The analysis shows that a stable majority of articles uses frames linked to the protest paradigm throughout the time period.

We argue that previous research has too narrowly focused on traditional ideological cleavages, neglecting the increasingly important sociocultural value dimension of politics. Using four waves of panel survey data collected in Sweden during 2020 and 2021, this study analyses ideological selective exposure, audience composition, and reinforcing spirals across a range of mainstream and alternative news outlets. Findings show (1) that the sociocultural value dimension is more important than the socioeconomic dimension for explaining news choices, (2) that it structures news audiences in uniquely distinct ways, and (3) that these relationships are highly stable over time-reflecting patterns of de facto selective exposure and ideological maintenance, rather than reinforcement. These findings bring new insights to research on selective news exposure, political polarization, and changing ideological cleavages in Western democracies.","[Shehata, Adam; Ekstrom, Mats] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Journalism Media & Commun, Seminariegatan 1B, S-41313 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Tryggvason, Per Oleskog] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Polit Sci, Gothenburg, Sweden",University of Gothenburg; University of Gothenburg,"Shehata, A (corresponding author), Univ Gothenburg, Dept Journalism Media & Commun, Seminariegatan 1B, S-41313 Gothenburg, Sweden.",adam.shehata@jmg.gu.se,,,European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union [804662]; Swedish Research Council [VR 2020-01915],European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union(European Research Council (ERC)); Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research CouncilEuropean Commission),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This project has received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program (grant agreement No 804662).

While the literature on populism has tended to focus on text- and language-based documents, such as speeches, policies, and party documents to consider how populists characterize the people, in this article I undertake a systematic visual content analysis to consider how populist leaders on either side of the ideological spectrum visually represent the people in images from their official Instagram accounts (N = 432). Comparing the cases of Donald Trump on the populist right and Bernie Sanders on the populist left, I code for the majority gender, race, and age of the people in each image, and supplement this with a discussion of the depictions of these categories. I find that Trump's images of the people are significantly more homogenous across all categories-specifically more white, more masculine, and with less young people-than Sanders', and situate these findings in the context of the literature on the differences between left and right populism. This article contributes to the study of populist communication by highlighting the role of images in representing the people; analyzing how left and right populists do this differently; and developing a method for measuring the demographic characteristics of the people in populists' images that can be used in future studies. In doing so, it seeks to push the literature forward by highlighting that images are not something extra to be studied in populist communication, but rather are a central battleground for the construction of populist identities.","[Moffitt, Benjamin] Australian Catholic Univ, Natl Sch Arts, Fitzroy, Vic, Australia",Australian Catholic University,"Moffitt, B (corresponding author), Australian Catholic Univ, Natl Sch Arts, Polit, 115 Victoria Parade, Fitzroy, Vic 3065, Australia.",benjamin.moffitt@acu.edu.au,,,Australian Research Council [DE190101127],Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"The author disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

These so-called digital opinion leaders may exert a powerful impact on their followers' political attitudes. Accordingly, we explore new directions to explain how influencers' communication is related to political outcomes by proposing the concept of perceived simplification of politics (PSP). We argue that PSP may fuel political cynicism but also stimulate youth's interest in politics. We also explore important boundary conditions of these associations. We use data from three studies, a two-wave panel survey of adolescents (N-T2 = 294), a cross-sectional survey of young adults (N = 632), and a two-wave panel survey of young adults (N-T2 = 496) in Germany between 2019 and 2020. Findings of all three studies show that the frequency of exposure to social media influencers' content increases PSP. In Studies 1 and 2, PSP is related to higher political cynicism, while in Study 3, this relationship is restricted to influencers' communication about environmental topics and gender equality. Furthermore, Studies 2 and 3 suggest that PSP also increases political interest-yet this association requires a certain level of parasocial interaction (PSI) with the influencer and is contingent on specific political topics.","[Schmuck, Desiree] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Sch Mass Commun Res, Pk Str 45, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium; [Hirsch, Melanie; Stevic, Anja; Matthes, Joerg] Univ Vienna, Dept Commun, Vienna, Austria",KU Leuven; University of Vienna,"Schmuck, D (corresponding author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, Sch Mass Commun Res, Pk Str 45, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.",desiree.schmuck@kuleuven.be,,,"Sparkling Science Programme Austrian Federal Ministry of Education, Science, and Research [SPA 06/109]; Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat Munchen (LMU Mentoring Program by the Department of Media and Communication), KU Leuven","Sparkling Science Programme Austrian Federal Ministry of Education, Science, and Research; Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat Munchen (LMU Mentoring Program by the Department of Media and Communication), KU Leuven","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the Sparkling Science Programme Austrian Federal Ministry of Education, Science, and Research (grant number SPA 06/109), Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat Munchen (LMU Mentoring Program by the Department of Media and Communication), KU Leuven, (Start-up Grant).",,59,0,0,18,21,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1940-1612,1940-1620,,INT J PRESS/POLIT,Int.

We draw on interviews with U.S. young adults conducted between April and November 2020. Based on our findings, we develop the concept of information cacophony to characterize young adults' experience of the contemporary information environment. Information cacophony is characterized by the jarring noise of many, discordant voices offering up information, under conditions of low media trust and an absence of a pre-defined epistemic hierarchy of sources. We illustrate how the volume and discordance of voices circulating content online makes it difficult for young adults to know what to believe, and show that young peoples' strategies for evaluating information are deeply entangled with the sociality and emotionality of the experience of information cacophony. We argue that existing theory is not yet well-developed to account for content evaluations and effects resulting from the novel complexities of navigating information cacophony. Existing work remains focused primarily on news exposure and effects, which misses the broader informational context within which young adults find themselves, and evolving strategies for evaluating information.","[Cotter, Kelley] Penn State Univ, Coll Informat Sci & Technol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Thorson, Kjerstin] Michigan State Univ, Coll Commun Arts & Sci, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Michigan State University,"Cotter, K (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Coll Informat Sci & Technol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",kcotter@psu.edu,,"Cotter, Kelley/0000-0003-1243-0131",,,,,38,1,1,3,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1940-1612,1940-1620,,INT J PRESS/POLIT,Int.

Two survey experiments were conducted via Amazon MTurk between late 2019 and early 2020, where participants were randomly assigned to read a mock news story about a foreign humanitarian crisis written using one of the three framing techniques. Results of both studies indicated that the framing effect on respondents' support for intervention interacted with ones' political ideology and prompted distinctive reactions among different populations. Most intriguingly, the results of Study 2, which employed a non-student sample and a secondary frame, suggested that the specific order of message framings also influences public opinion towards humanitarian intervention. These findings contribute to the growing body of literature on the persuasiveness of message design and framing in the context of military humanitarian interventions (MHI). Accordingly, news organizations and policymakers are encouraged to consider these findings in specific contexts.","[Ji, Qihao] Marist Coll, Commun, Poughkeepsie, NY USA; [Pupcenoks, Juris] Marist Coll, Polit Sci, Poughkeepsie, NY USA",Marist College; Marist College,"Ji, QH (corresponding author), Marist Coll, Sch Commun & Arts, Lowell Thomas 249, Poughkeepsie, NY 12601 USA.",jiqihao@gmail.com,,,,,,,60,0,0,2,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1940-1612,1940-1620,,INT J PRESS/POLIT,Int.

Citizens are therefore increasingly confronted with the proposition of which polls to give more credence to than others in shaping their voting behaviour. This study investigates the relationship between subjective determinations of poll credibility and voting behaviour in the polarised context of Turkish mayoral elections. The theoretical perspective of motivated reasoning is employed to consider how individuals determine and act upon credible opinion polls in mixed information environments. Using an original two-step experimental approach conducted in 2020, this paper establishes that while the effects of opinion poll credibility on party choice are limited to the strategic considerations of the supporters of smaller parties, opinion polls can have considerable demobilising effects when polling environments are conflicting or deemed not credible. The findings produced in this study are more suggestive of accuracy-seeking than directional motivations, and they have considerable implications for how we think about the relationship between polls, politicians, and voters.","[Dawson, Stephen] Univ Gothenburg, Sprangkullsgatan 19, S-41123 Gothenburg, Sweden",University of Gothenburg,"Dawson, S (corresponding author), Univ Gothenburg, Sprangkullsgatan 19, S-41123 Gothenburg, Sweden.",stephen.dawson@gu.se,"Dawson, Stephen/GLT-9133-2022","Dawson, Stephen/0000-0002-2941-4413",Riksbankens Jubileumsfond; Stiftelsen Lars Hiertas Minne [M18-0310:1],Riksbankens Jubileumsfond; Stiftelsen Lars Hiertas Minne,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the Riksbankens Jubileumsfond-funded Knowledge Resistance Project and Stiftelsen Lars Hiertas Minne, (grant number M18-0310:1).",,52,0,0,1,1,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1940-1612,1940-1620,,INT J PRESS/POLIT,Int.

The material was obtained from the 2012-2016 wave of the Worlds of Journalism Study, a comparative study designed to assess the state of journalism throughout the world. The advantage of this study over similar undertakings in the past is that we did not confront journalists with ready-made statements but invited them to tell us, in their own words, what they thought the major roles of journalists in their countries ought to be. Open responses of more than 10,200 journalists from twenty-seven European countries yielded 12,860 references. Results show that the most important roles refer to the domain of political life, especially the informational-instructive and the critical-monitorial functions-a finding that is consistent across the twenty-seven countries investigated. Beyond this shared global vision, it is, however, possible to point out some national specificities, keeping in mind that even if the core of the normative roles remains somewhat universal, a detailed comparison of those roles in their cultural context allows us to grasp some differences in their hierarchy and their meaning.","[Standaert, Olivier] Catholic Univ Louvain, Louvain Sch Commun, Ruelle Lanterne Magique 14,Box L2-03-02, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium",Universite Catholique Louvain,"Standaert, O (corresponding author), Catholic Univ Louvain, Louvain Sch Commun, Ruelle Lanterne Magique 14,Box L2-03-02, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium.",Olivier.standaert@uclouvain.be,,"Standaert, Olivier/0000-0002-0387-4198",Fonds De La Recherche Scientifique-FNRS,Fonds De La Recherche Scientifique-FNRS(Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS),"The author disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The author received financial support for the research project of this article by the Fonds De La Recherche Scientifique-FNRS.",,54,0,0,1,2,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1940-1612,1940-1620,,INT J PRESS/POLIT,Int.

During the experiment reported here, participants (N= 315) were exposed to biased (pro- and anti-Trump) news stories that were attributed to eitherCNN, Breitbart, or remained unattributed to a news brand. After reading the stories, participants rated the stories for their relative slantedness in favor of, neutral, or against the president. Findings reveal that news users are sensitized to the president's accusations of bias againstCNN. For example, anti-Trump stories were rated as more slanted than pro-Trump stories when they were attributed toCNN. This was not the case when the same stories were attributed toBreitbart. Interestingly, unattributed biased news received the highest ratings for slantedness.","[Kim, Minchul] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Inst Convergence, 25-2 Sungkyunkwan Ro, Seoul 03063, South Korea; [Grabe, Maria Elizabeth] Indiana Univ, Observ Social Media, Bloomington, IN USA; [Grabe, Maria Elizabeth] Indiana Univ, Media Sch, Bloomington, IN USA",Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU); Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Kim, M (corresponding author), Sungkyunkwan Univ, Inst Convergence, 25-2 Sungkyunkwan Ro, Seoul 03063, South Korea.",kimminc731@gmail.com,"Kim, Minchul/AAY-8337-2020","Kim, Minchul/0000-0002-7707-5436; Grabe, Maria Elizabeth/0000-0001-6372-8363",,,,,51,1,1,1,15,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1940-1612,1940-1620,,INT J PRESS/POLIT,Int.

We further examine how individual predispositions (e.g. political interest, ideology) and contextual variables (e.g. press freedom) moderate these relationships. Based on data from the 2019 Reuters Institute Digital News Report, and controlling for a range of factors, we find that across 38 countries, watchdog performance evaluations are positively associated with trust in news but that they are also positively associated with higher levels of news avoidance. Last, we find that evaluations of media in other functions like helping citizens understand the most important topics of the day and choosing relevant topics were more strongly associated to trust in news and lower news avoidance levels than watchdog performance evaluations.","[Kalogeropoulos, Antonis] Univ Liverpool, Dept Commun & Media, Liverpool, Merseyside, England; [Toff, Benjamin] Univ Minnesota, Hubbard Sch Journalism & Mass Commun, Minneapolis, MN USA; [Fletcher, Richard] Univ Oxford, Reuters Inst Study Journalism, Dept Polit & Int Relat, Oxford, England",University of Liverpool; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Oxford,"Kalogeropoulos, A (corresponding author), Univ Liverpool, Dept Commun & Media, Sch Arts, G06b,19 Abercromby Sq, Liverpool L69 7ZG, Merseyside, England.",A.Kalogeropoulos@liverpool.ac.uk,,"Kalogeropoulos, Antonis/0000-0002-2096-5382; Fletcher, Richard/0000-0002-5496-2112",Google UK as part of the Google News Initiative,Google UK as part of the Google News Initiative(Google Incorporated),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was supported by Google UK as part of the Google News Initiative.",,59,0,0,7,7,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1940-1612,1940-1620,,INT J PRESS/POLIT,Int.

The photographic images caused an uproar and contributed to the CDU's defeat in the September 23 election. The paper analyzes why these images resonated with such damaging effects. Theoretically, it sets the analysis on the background of the moralization and personalization of politics and argues that photography, with its ability to capture behavior at a distance, plays a prominent role in these processes. While this condition explains why an image of a laughing politician can generate such indignation in the first place, the paper discusses how this effect was amplified in the case of Laschet by a range of contextual features: (a) the timing of the images in the middle of an election period where politicians come under intense scrutiny; (b) their appearance in a crisis situation (the German flooding disaster) where politicians are surrounded by other role expectations than in routine periods; (3) Laschet's new, insecure position as leader of the CDU; (d) his history of scandals and poor political judgment; and (e) the frivolous and boisterous manner of his laughter. At a general theoretical level, the paper's insights caution us to avoid prima facie conclusions about the autonomous power of photographs. Instead, they encourage analytical sensitivity to the importance of timing and context as explanatory elements in our understanding of photographic exposes.","[Olesen, Thomas] Aarhus Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Bartholins Alle 7, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark",Aarhus University,"Olesen, T (corresponding author), Aarhus Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Bartholins Alle 7, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.",tho@ps.au.dk,,,,,,,64,0,0,3,3,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1940-1612,1940-1620,,INT J PRESS/POLIT,Int.

Advancing diverse causal order structural equation models, this study highlights a positive influence of news consumption, social media political expression, and political discussion in explaining political consumerism (i.e., boycotting and buycotting).

Yet, there is also evidence that the Internet can provide opportunities for individuals to incidentally encounter and learn from news, which may decrease these knowledge gaps. The current study tests this possibility using two, two-wave panel surveys of adults in the United States conducted during the 2012 and 2016 presidential elections. Across two distinct electoral contexts, we find evidence that incidental exposure to online news and political information promotes learning about presidential candidates' policy positions over the course of the campaign. In addition, the data suggest the least politically interested benefit the most from this incidental exposure, as they see the largest gains in political knowledge. These findings indicate that opportunities to learn via incidental exposure have the potential to reduce motivation-based knowledge gaps.","[Weeks, Brian E.; Hahn, Lauren B.] Univ Michigan, Dept Commun & Media, 105 South State St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Weeks, Brian E.] Univ Michigan, Ctr Polit Studies, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Lane, Daniel S.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Commun, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara,"Weeks, BE (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Commun & Media, 105 South State St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",beweeks@umich.edu,"Weeks, Brian/AHB-0858-2022","Weeks, Brian/0000-0003-2355-2302; Hahn, Lauren B./0000-0002-2054-0800",Department of Communication and Media at the University of Michigan,Department of Communication and Media at the University of Michigan(University of Michigan System),"The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study was funded in part by the Marsh Research Award from the Department of Communication and Media at the University of Michigan.",,40,5,5,5,13,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1940-1612,1940-1620,,INT J PRESS/POLIT,Int.

To date, most studies of RT have focused on its broadcast, website, and social media content, with little research on its audiences. Through a data-driven application of network science and other computational methods, we address this gap to provide insight into the demographics and interests of RT's Twitter followers, as well as how they engage with RT. Building upon recent studies of Russian state-sponsored media, we report three main results. First, we find that most of RT's Twitter followers only very rarely engage with its content and tend to be exposed to RT's content alongside other mainstream news channels. This indicates that RT is not a central part of their online news media environment. Second, using probabilistic computational methods, we show that followers of RT are slightly more likely to be older and male than average Twitter users, and they are far more likely to be bots. Third, we identify thirty-five distinct audience segments, which vary in terms of their nationality, languages, and interests. This audience segmentation reveals the considerable heterogeneity of RT's Twitter followers. Accordingly, we conclude that generalizations about RT's audience based on analyses of RT's media content, or on vocal minorities among its wider audiences, are unhelpful and limit our understanding of RT and its appeal to international audiences.","[Crilley, Rhys] Univ Glasgow, Dept Polit & Int Relat, Adam Smith Bldg, Glasgow G12 8RT, Lanark, Scotland; [Gillespie, Marie] Open Univ, Sociol, Milton Keynes, Bucks, England; [Vidgen, Bertie] Alan Turing Inst, Publ Policy Program, London, England; [Willis, Alistair] Open Univ, Sch Comp & Commun, Milton Keynes, Bucks, England",University of Glasgow; Open University - UK; Open University - UK,"Crilley, R (corresponding author), Univ Glasgow, Dept Polit & Int Relat, Adam Smith Bldg, Glasgow G12 8RT, Lanark, Scotland.",Rhys.crilley@glasgow.ac.uk,,"Crilley, Rhys/0000-0003-1816-5535",Arts and Humanities Research Council [AH/P00508X/1]; AHRC [AH/P00508X/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Arts and Humanities Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC)); AHRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC)),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was part of the Arts and Humanities Research Council funded project Reframing Russia: From Cold War to `Information War'?: [Grant Number AH/P00508X/1].",,58,8,8,5,14,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1940-1612,1940-1620,,INT J PRESS/POLIT,Int.

This study adopts a social movement diffusion perspective to sharpen the transborder dimension of the protest paradigm. Specifically, we introduce the concept of the diffusion-proofing protest paradigm, given that an understudied and undertheorized function of the protest paradigm is the prevention of the import of exogenous social movements. Taking the Hong Kong Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill Movement as an example, we investigate how mainland China's mass media acted to prevent movement diffusion. Four transborder components of the diffusion-proofing protest paradigm are proposed: reactions, attributions, consequences, and solutions. Through content analysis, we argue that by highlighting these transborder components, China's newspapers attributed the movement's rise to foreign intervention, emphasized the movement's negative effects on both Hong Kong and mainland China, and revealed the uncompromising nature of China's reaction and the urgency of cross-border cooperation for containing the movement and its diffusion. Further, we identify two modes of reporting: a mainly descriptive mode that relied on a local framework to depict the movement and its local context and an evaluative mode that emphasized the level of deviance and foreign intervention, thus amplifying the movement's transborder effects and the need to prevent its diffusion. Notably, the level of deviance acts as a mediating channel between the two modes, transforming the local framework into a transborder one. The diffusion-proofing protest paradigm is also found to vary across media types and periods.","[Huang, Vincent Guangsheng] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Media & Int Culture, Hangzhou, Peoples R China; [Li, Xueqing] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Media & Commun, Dongchuan Rd 800, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University; Shanghai Jiao Tong University,"Li, XQ (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Media & Commun, Dongchuan Rd 800, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",lixueqingivory@sjtu.edu.cn,,"Li, Xueqing/0000-0002-4133-5953",National Social Science Fund of China [20CXW002],National Social Science Fund of China,"The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the National Social Science Fund of China (grant number 20CXW002).",,44,0,0,4,4,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1940-1612,1940-1620,,INT J PRESS/POLIT,Int.

But how media self-censorship may evolve in online journalism has remained largely unexplored. Using Hong Kong as a case, I examine the digital evolution of media self-censorship in a unique non-democratic context. Drawing on interviews with online journalists, my findings reveal that digital transformation has provided new valences for media self-censorship. With the financial hardship of legacy media in the digital age, Hong Kong online journalists are more directly exposed to external threats such as advertisement boycotts orchestrated by the state, and hence increasingly reluctant to offend external powerholders out of the fear of political and financial retaliation. Moreover, as online journalists adopt business-driven norms that favor the generation of clicks, political or policy news are further marginalized. These stories are often deemed boring, non-engaging to online audiences, and are not sensationalizable due to political risks, especially when compared to soft news types like crimes and lifestyles stories. Adapting to these changes, news managers are increasingly used to avoiding professional editorial debates that results are unpredictable but using objective web metrics as persuasive devices to discourage the production of sensitive news. Lastly, the dissemination of sensitive news is curbed in the social media gatekeeping process. These findings suggest that an authoritarian state can effectively influence online news production by controlling the capital that drives digital transformation, thereby limiting the liberating potential of the media in the digital age.","[Koo, Alex Zhi-Xiong] Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Koo, AZX (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Sch Journalism & Mass Commun, Vilas Commun Hall,5115 Univ Ave, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",zkoo@wisc.edu,,,,,,,47,0,0,2,4,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1940-1612,1940-1620,,INT J PRESS/POLIT,Int.

However, there is still a lack of comparative research on how citizens combine the usage of different media and how that is related to political knowledge. To fill this void, we use a unique cross-national survey about the online and offline media use habits of more than 28,000 individuals in 17 European countries. Our aim is to (i) profile different types of news consumers and (ii) understand how each user profile is linked to political knowledge acquisition. Our results show that five user profiles - news minimalists, social media news users, traditionalists, online news seekers, and hyper news consumers - can be identified, although the prevalence of these profiles varies across countries. Findings further show that both traditional and online-based news diets are correlated with higher political knowledge. However, online-based news use is more widespread in Southern Europe, where it is associated with lower levels of political knowledge than in Northern Europe. By focusing on news audiences, this study provides a comprehensive and fine-grained analysis of how contemporary European political information environments perform and contribute to an informed citizenry.","[Castro, Laia; Esser, Frank] Univ Zurich, Dept Commun & Media Res, Zurich, Switzerland; [Esser, Frank] Univ Zurich, Int & Comparat Media Res, Zurich, Switzerland; [Castro, Laia] Univ Int Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain; [Stromback, Jesper] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Journalism Media & Commun, Journalism & Polit Commun, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Van Aelst, Peter] Univ Antwerp, Dept Polit Sci, Antwerp, Belgium; [de Vreese, Claes] Univ Amsterdam, Polit Commun ASCoR, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [de Vreese, Claes] Univ Amsterdam, AI & Democracy, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Aalberg, Toril] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Sociol & Polit Sci, Trondheim, Norway; [Cardenal, Ana S.] Univ Oberta Catalunya, Polit Sci Law & Polit Sci Dept, Barcelona, Spain; [Corbu, Nicoleta] Natl Univ Polit Studies & Publ Adm, Ctr Commun Res, Bucharest, Romania; [Corbu, Nicoleta] Natl Univ Polit Studies & Publ Adm, Multidisciplinary PhD Sch, Bucharest, Romania; [Hopmann, David Nicolas] Univ Southern Denmark, Ctr Journalism, Odense M, Denmark; [Koc-Michalska, Karolina] Audencia Business Sch, Nantes, France; [Koc-Michalska, Karolina] Univ Silesia, Fac Social Sci, Katowice, Poland; [Matthes, Jorg] Univ Vienna, Commun Sci, Vienna, Austria; [Schemer, Christian] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Dept Commun, Commun, Mainz, Germany; [Sheafer, Tamir] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Polit Sci, Jerusalem, Israel; [Sheafer, Tamir] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Commun & Journalism, Jerusalem, Israel; [Sheafer, Tamir] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Polit Sci, Jerusalem, Israel; [Splendore, Sergio] Univ Milan, Dept Social & Polit Sci, Milan, Italy; [Stanyer, James; Stetka, Vaclav] Loughborough Univ, Sch Social Sci & Humanities, Commun & Media Anal, Loughborough, Leics, England; [Stepinska, Agnieszka] Adam Mickiewicz Univ, Fac Polit Sci & Journalism, Poznan, Poland; [Theocharis, Yannis] Tech Univ Munich, TUM Sch Governance, Digital Governance, Munich, Germany",University of Zurich; University of Zurich; Universitat Internacional de Catalunya (UIC); University of Gothenburg; University of Antwerp; University of Amsterdam; University of Amsterdam; Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); UOC Universitat Oberta de Catalunya; National University of Political Studies & Public Administration; National University of Political Studies & Public Administration; University of Southern Denmark; Audencia; University of Silesia in Katowice; University of Vienna; Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz; Hebrew University of Jerusalem; Hebrew University of Jerusalem; Hebrew University of Jerusalem; University of Milan; Loughborough University; Adam Mickiewicz University; Technical University of Munich,"Castro, L (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, IKMZ, Div Int & Comparat Media Res, Andreasstr 15, CH-8050 Zurich, Switzerland.",l.castro@ikmz.uzh.ch,"Corbu, Nicoleta/AFN-5125-2022; Cardenal, Ana S./AAY-1033-2021; Stetka, Vaclav/AAR-6858-2021","Cardenal, Ana S./0000-0002-1540-8004; Stetka, Vaclav/0000-0001-8381-3645; Stepinska, Agnieszka/0000-0002-7361-2986; Castro Herrero, Laia/0000-0001-6281-0365; Koc-Michalska, Karolina/0000-0002-5354-5616","Network of European Political Communication Scholars (NEPOCS); University of Southern Denmark; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/S01019X/1]; Audencia Foundation grant; research project Knowledge resistance: causes, consequences, cures - Riksbankens Jubileumsfond; ZeMKI Lenkungskreis","Network of European Political Communication Scholars (NEPOCS); University of Southern Denmark; Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Audencia Foundation grant; research project Knowledge resistance: causes, consequences, cures - Riksbankens Jubileumsfond; ZeMKI Lenkungskreis","This project was financially supported by the Network of European Political Communication Scholars (NEPOCS).

Drawing from Max Weber's early twentieth century writings on journalism, we argue that similar cross-national judgments reveal journalism's shared structural basis as a commercial enterprise, whereas differences highlight the distinctive social functions that journalists assume in particular national settings. We illustrate this framework via semi-structured interviews conducted between 2015 and 2020 with a strategic sample of French and American journalists evaluating their best work. In both country samples, journalists that express pride in attracting audiences by translating complex issues and dignifying story subjects highlight journalism's structural basis. Cross-national differences reflect nationally distinct understandings of journalism's social functions, with French journalists emphasizing their ability to shed light on large issues and their American counterparts highlighting efforts to pry information from power holders.","[Vera-Zambrano, Sandra] Univ Iberoamer, Commun, Lomas Santa Fe, Mexico; [Powers, Matthew] Univ Washington, Dept Commun, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Vera-Zambrano, S (corresponding author), Univ Iberoamer, Dept Comunicac, Paseo Reforma 880, Lomas De Santa Fe 01219, Mexico.",Sandra.vera@ibero.mx,,"Vera-Zambrano, Sandra/0000-0001-9016-8648",,,,,50,0,0,4,13,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1940-1612,1940-1620,,INT J PRESS/POLIT,Int.

Which strategies have journalists developed to maintain the public's trust, and what may be the implications for democracy? These questions are addressed using a thematic analysis of forty-five semistructured interviews with leading Israeli journalists who have been publicly targeted by Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. The article suggests that while most interviewees asserted that adherence to objective reporting was the best response to antimedia populism, many of them have in fact applied a strategic bias to their reporting, intentionally leaning to the Right in an attempt to refute the accusations of media bias to the Left. This strategy was shaped by interviewees' perceived helplessness versus Israel's Prime Minister and his extensive use of social media, a phenomenon called here the influence of presumed media impotence. Finally, this article points at the potential ramifications of strategic bias for journalism and democracy. Drawing on Hallin's Spheres theory, it claims that the strategic bias might advance Right-wing populism at present, while also narrowing the sphere of legitimate controversy-thus further restricting press freedom-in the future.","[Panievsky, Ayala] Univ Cambridge, Dept Sociol, 16 Mill Lane, Cambridge CB2 1SB, England",University of Cambridge,"Panievsky, A (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Sociol, 16 Mill Lane, Cambridge CB2 1SB, England.",Ap2034@cam.ac.uk,,"Panievsky, Ayala/0000-0001-9296-7670",,,,,49,6,6,3,9,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1940-1612,1940-1620,,INT J PRESS/POLIT,Int.

However, defining, operationalizing, and measuring news media quality is difficult, because evaluative criteria depend upon beliefs about the ideal society, which are inherently contested. This conceptual and methodological paper outlines important considerations for defining news media quality before developing and applying a multimethod approach to measure it. We refer to Giddens' notion of double hermeneutics, which reveals that the ways social scientists understand constructs inevitably interact with the meanings of these constructs shared by people in society. Reflecting the two-way relationship between society and social sciences enables us to recognize news media quality as a dynamic, contingent, and contested construct and, at the same time, to reason our understanding of news media quality, which we derive from Habermas' ideal of deliberative democracy. Moreover, we investigate the Swiss media system to showcase our measurement approach in a repeated data collection from 2017 to 2020. We assess the content quality of fifty news media outlets using four criteria derived from the deliberative ideal (N = 20,931 and 18,559 news articles and broadcasting items, respectively) and compare the results with those from two representative online surveys (N = 2,169 and 2,159 respondents). The high correlations between both methods show that a deliberative understanding of news media quality is anchored in Swiss society and shared by audiences.

It does so with a focus on perceptions of responsibility for the 2009-2015 economic crisis and within the context of the Netherlands. Results demonstrate that exposure to episodically framed crisis news caused a decline in the attribution of responsibility to individual citizens, whereas thematic framing did not affect this. Framing effects on the attribution of political responsibility, instead, were conditional on political ideology: Episodic framing decreased the attribution of political responsibility, whereas thematic framing increased the attribution of responsibility to political actors, but both effects occurred primarily among citizens with a right-wing political-economic ideology. Accordingly, we add an explanation for the inconsistency of effect directions in previously published research on the effects that episodic and thematic framing may have on responsibility attributions.","[Boukes, Mark] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Commun Res ASCoR, Dept Commun Sci, Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam,"Boukes, M (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Commun Res, Nieuwe Achtergracht 166, NL-1018 WV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",markboukes@gmail.com,"Boukes, Mark/K-5090-2014","Boukes, Mark/0000-0002-3377-6281",Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) [016.145.369],Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) with a VIDI grant under project number: 016.145.369.",,65,6,6,1,9,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1940-1612,1940-1620,,INT J PRESS/POLIT,Int.

To explain the success of populists' deliberate provocations, we drew from research on populism and scandal theory to develop a theoretical framework that we tested in three studies examining the rise of German right-wing populist party Alternative fur Deutschland (AfD) between January 2015 and December 2018. In Study 1, an input-output analysis of 17 deliberate provocations by AfD politicians in German news media revealed much more coverage about their attacks on migrants than about their attacks on political elites, although all were covered in predominantly scandalizing ways.

However, most of this research is conducted in an experimental setting, and we do not know how this works in the real world, where citizens predominantly consume news from media outlets they trust and perceive as ideologically like-minded. By questioning Belgian citizens about their perceptions of partisan bias in their preferred news outlet, this study shows that the hostile media phenomenon also holds in a least likely context; even content produced by friendly news sources is seen as ideologically slanted, potentially contributing to citizens' general distrust in the news media.

Growing up in this information landscape, younger generations have developed news-related practices and attitudes that lie in stark contrast to those of previous generations. In addition, discrepancies exist between news definitions and the use practices of young people. We conducted focus groups with German adolescents (15-17 years), young adults (18-24 years) and adults (40-53 years) in August 2020 to uncover young peoples' orientation toward news and journalism. Our study indicates that the boundaries of what journalism is and what it is not are becoming increasingly indistinct. However, distinctions do emerge between the journalistic and non-journalistic sources that adolescents and young adults use and the functions they associate with them according to their information needs. Differences between the age groups become apparent in their motivations to stay informed which highlights the important role non-journalistic sources play in information behaviour and opinion formation. For teenage participants especially, Social Media Influencers (SMIs) are relevant within these processes, which are linked to a perceived social duty-to-keep-informed. Moreover, findings from the focus groups highlight cohort-specific differences regarding the understanding of journalism and, consequently, differences in the assessment of trust and reliability as well as the verification strategies that are applied. In sum, for young participants journalism is a reliable source of information, especially in the case of current events and for crosschecking online information, while non-journalistic sources fulfil social needs.","[Wunderlich, Leonie; Holig, Sascha; Hasebrink, Uwe] Hans Bredow Inst, Leibniz Inst Media Res, Rothenbaumchaussee 36, D-20148 Hamburg, Germany",,"Wunderlich, L (corresponding author), Hans Bredow Inst, Leibniz Inst Media Res, Rothenbaumchaussee 36, D-20148 Hamburg, Germany.",l.wunderlich@leibniz-hbi.de,"Wunderlich, Leonie/AAD-5565-2022","Wunderlich, Leonie/0000-0002-6750-4540",German Press Agency (dpa),German Press Agency (dpa),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the German Press Agency (dpa)",,52,0,0,3,8,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1940-1612,1940-1620,,INT J PRESS/POLIT,Int.

The media's capability to set the public agenda and create issues as a common core is a pivotal part of the public sphere and contributes fundamentally to society's cohesion. Algorithm-driven sources like social media that personalize content to the preferences of individuals and their social networks are considered agents of fragmentation of the public sphere. Politically extreme individuals relying on them may be particularly vulnerable to losing touch with society's common core. We employ an innovative operationalization of fragmentation on the individual level: issue horizons-comprising issue diversity, top issue focus, and issue overlap-to investigate how different information sources affect fragmentation. In a two-week daily diary, conducted 2016 in Germany, 356 participants named the two most important political issues of each day and reported the issue-specific sources of information. Results show that social media reliance neither increases nor decreases the compatibility of individuals' issue horizons, but news media reliance significantly increases the compatibility of issue horizons among the politically more extreme. Not relying on news media (but rather on social media) means that politically extreme persons are at risk of losing touch with society's mainstream. This attests to the news media's ongoing, indispensable integration function. Using multiple sources of political information-including the news media-appears to be of paramount importance in ensuring that most citizens are aware of the most important issues facing the nation.","[Magin, Melanie; Geiss, Stefan] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Sociol & Polit Sci, Bldg 9,Level 5, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Stark, Birgit; Juergens, Pascal] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Dept Commun, Mainz, Germany",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz,"Magin, M (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Sociol & Polit Sci, Bldg 9,Level 5, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway.",melanie.magin@ntnu.no,,"Jurgens, Pascal/0000-0002-6810-0011; Magin, Melanie/0000-0003-2545-3594",Media Authority of North Rhine Westphalia (Landesanstalt fur Medien Nordrhein-Westfalen); Research Unit Media Convergence of JGU Mainz,Media Authority of North Rhine Westphalia (Landesanstalt fur Medien Nordrhein-Westfalen); Research Unit Media Convergence of JGU Mainz,"The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the Media Authority of North RhineWestphalia (Landesanstalt fur Medien Nordrhein-Westfalen) and the Research Unit Media Convergence of JGU Mainz.",,48,2,2,6,21,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1940-1612,1940-1620,,INT J PRESS/POLIT,Int.

The main contribution is to examine the impact of government size and press freedom across the conditional distribution of corruption in SSA. The findings show that the impacts of government size and press freedom are heterogeneous across the conditional quantile distribution of corruption.

The #MeToo movement stands out due to the volume of attention it generated. Yet, it is unclear how news media across the partisan spectrum covered the movement using different sexual violence language markers, latent topic, and word choices and which accusations and events drove media attention. To examine this, we used Media Cloud to extract 17,877 news articles from nine media outlets across the political spectrum, containing specific n-grams or co-occurrences of (1) metoo, (2) sexual misconduct, (3) sexual harassment, and (4) sexual assault from October 2017 through February 2018. The analyses first examined whether language and attention differed across the ideological news ecology and then turned to time-series modeling of these discourses to examine what drove press coverage and structural topic modeling (STM) and term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) analysis to understand latent topics and language usage. Findings reveal that (1) left-leaning media dedicated more relative attention across all topics-#MeToo, sexual misconduct, sexual harassment, and sexual assault-relative to centrist and right-leaning media. Moreover, across the right, left, and centrist media, the language markers misconduct, harassment, and assault decreased over the study period, while the mentions of #MeToo movement increased during the same period; (2) stories relating to entertainment and those accusing politicians, especially those belonging to the party in power at the Federal level, seemed to be by far the strongest driver of news media attention; and (3) we further observed partisan differences in topics of news coverage and language usage.","[Ghosh, Shreenita; Su, Min-Hsin; Abhishek, Aman; Suk, Jiyoun; Tong, Chau; Kamath, Kruthika; Hills, Ornella; Garlough, Christine; Shah, Dhavan] Univ Wisconsin, Vilas Commun Hall,821 Univ Ave, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Correa, Teresa] Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Borah, Porismita] Washington State Univ, Pullman, WA 99164 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; Washington State University,"Ghosh, S (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Vilas Commun Hall,821 Univ Ave, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",ghosh26@gmail.com,"Correa, Teresa/AAR-7771-2021","Correa, Teresa/0000-0003-0508-7371; SUK, JIYOUN/0000-0003-4690-2395; Ghosh, Shreenita/0000-0002-9440-7789; Shah, Dhavan/0000-0001-5034-2816",,,,,60,3,3,3,9,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1940-1612,1940-1620,,INT J PRESS/POLIT,Int.

This paper examines how members of parliament (MPs) handle this dilemma within intra-coalition parliamentary negotiations that are essential for legislative decision-making. By referring to the mediatization approach, the concept of self-mediatization of political negotiation systems is introduced to theoretically capture politicians' self-initiated media publications regarding negotiations and associated changes in their negotiation behavior. It is hypothesized that the self-mediatization of negotiations is influenced by negotiators' general tendency to seek media attention as well as situational pressures and incentives. The hypotheses were tested with a factorial survey among German state-level MPs (n = 258) using experimental vignettes. Results show that both individual and situational factors affect parliamentarians' tendency to publicly communicate about negotiations and consequently negotiate in a more news-media-logic-compatible, that is, more conflictual, manner. However, since the surveyed MPs on average show a high willingness to agree with their coalition partner on the explicit secrecy of negotiations, independent of the influencing parameters examined, self-mediatization does not seem to be an existential threat to the intra-coalition compromise-building capacity of parliamentary negotiation systems.","[Philipps, Gerrit] Heinrich Heine Univ Dusseldorf, Dept Social Sci, Univ Str 1, D-40225 Dusseldorf, Germany",Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf,"Philipps, G (corresponding author), Heinrich Heine Univ Dusseldorf, Dept Social Sci, Univ Str 1, D-40225 Dusseldorf, Germany.",gerrit.philipps@hhu.de,,,,,,,49,0,0,0,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1940-1612,1940-1620,,INT J PRESS/POLIT,Int.

We have three key findings. Firstly, the visibility of political actors in the news follows a clear institutional hierarchy led by the president and cabinet members. Secondly, female politicians are less likely to be mentioned or have speaking space in newspapers than male politicians. Lastly, although an association with conflict-framed news boosts politicians' visibility, such association is unable to disturb structural power hierarchies, and the value of conflict does not increase over time.","[Orchard, Ximena] Univ Alberto Hurtado, Santiago, Chile; [Gonzalez-Bustamante, Bastian] Univ Oxford, Oxford, England; [Gonzalez-Bustamante, Bastian] Univ Santiago Chile USACH, Santiago, Chile",Universidad Alberto Hurtado; University of Oxford; Universidad de Santiago de Chile,"Orchard, X (corresponding author), Univ Alberto Hurtado, Journalism Dept, Almirante Barroso 10, Santiago, Chile.",morchard@uahurtado.cl,,"Gonzalez-Bustamante, Bastian/0000-0003-1510-6820; Orchard, Ximena/0000-0002-8687-1098",Research Promotion Fund - Universidad Alberto Hurtado [DIP2019-9],Research Promotion Fund - Universidad Alberto Hurtado,"This project was supported by a Research Promotion Fund (DIP2019-9), granted by Universidad Alberto Hurtado.",,54,0,0,2,9,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1940-1612,1940-1620,,INT J PRESS/POLIT,Int.

Our findings suggest that young citizens are more frequent users of online news overall and that the rank order of different news activities replicates cross-nationally. The frequency of online political expression is negatively related to age, with older people less likely to post online. Age moderates the relationship between political interest and news consumption as well as news consumption and online political expression. The correlations of these sets of variables are stronger for younger respondents compared to older respondents. These findings hold across the three countries under study.

Drawing from social identity theory and intergroup threat theory, I theorized that exposure to news about Trump's anti-German utterances indirectly increases anti-Americanism in Germany. First, I theorized that Trump's utterances result in negative attitudes toward Trump and, in turn, increase anti-Americanism (spillover effect). Second, I theorized that Trump's anti-German utterances indirectly affect anti-Americanism via increased European Union (EU) popularity. Furthermore, I assumed that effects would be stronger for individuals low in political interest. A quota-based online experiment (N= 428) revealed that Trump's anti-German utterances increased EU's popularity. This effect was moderated by political interest. EU's popularity was increased for moderately interested individuals and individuals low in political interest. No effects were detected for highly interested individuals. EU popularity, in turn, increased anti-Americanism. Therefore, Trump's anti-German utterances indirectly increased anti-Americanism burdening relations between Germany and the United States.

Integrating the motivated reasoning and discrete emotions' frameworks, we offer a theoretical framework of motivated mobilization for explaining political engagement in response to poll exposure. Specifically, we examine the mediating role of emotions in the relationship between motivated assessments of polls and political mobilization. To test this model, we offer empirical evidence from an online survey-experiment (N = 540) conducted during the 2019 Indian general election. We find that exposure to favorable poll results increases enthusiasm and decreases anger, while both enthusiasm and anger activate behavioral intention for political participation. While our study supports the existing findings which show that partisanship is an important predictor of mobilization for a party and candidate, we uncover the affective routes through which partisanship operates to shape poll reactions. The results underscore the importance of capturing individual variability in preexisting affiliations and their shaping of poll reactions through affect-driven motivated reactions. We discuss these results with regard to the dynamics of political mobilization during election campaigns, the role of emotions in political cognition at large, and in understanding and mitigating biases in poll perceptions.","[Neyazi, Taberez Ahmed] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Commun & New Media, Polit Commun & New Media, Singapore, Singapore; [Neyazi, Taberez Ahmed; Kuru, Ozan] Natl Univ Singapore, Ctr Trusted Internet & Community, Singapore, Singapore; [Kuru, Ozan] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Commun & New Media, Digital Media, Singapore, Singapore",National University of Singapore; National University of Singapore; National University of Singapore,"Neyazi, TA (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, AS6,11 Comp Dr, Singapore, Singapore.",taberez@nus.edu.sg,"; Neyazi, Taberez/B-7245-2008","Kuru, Ozan/0000-0002-0485-1705; Neyazi, Taberez/0000-0001-8695-1007",JSPS [18H03624],"JSPS(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science)","We would like to thank JSPS Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (A) 18H03624 (Representative: Prof. Kazuya Nakamizo, Kyoto University) for supporting this study.",,70,0,0,4,7,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1940-1612,1940-1620,,INT J PRESS/POLIT,Int.

While most innovation projects in democratic regimes receive funding from media organizations, venture capital firms, and foundations, many of China's digital journalism projects are funded and led by the state-a model we define as state-preneurship. In this study, we compare this model with other digital innovation models on three dimensions: the amount and sustainability of funding, the extent of newsroom restructuring, and the transformation of journalistic culture. We focus on the early national success case, Shanghai-based news outlet Pengpai, as well as on eight of its regional copycats. Based on interviews with forty-three executives, journalists, propaganda officials, media investors, and scholars, we argue that while in the short run, state-preneurship has produced fast and large-scale transformations in the digital journalism industry, these changes appear as largely unsustainable in the long run. This is due to (1) the political contingency of state investments and (2) the limited transformation in journalistic culture.","[Fang, Kecheng] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Sch Journalism & Commun, Sha Tin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Repnikova, Maria] Georgia State Univ, Global Commun, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA",Chinese University of Hong Kong; University System of Georgia; Georgia State University,"Fang, KC (corresponding author), Chinese Univ Hong Kong, New Asia Coll, Sch Journalism & Commun, Sha Tin, Room 203,Humanities Bldg, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",kfang@cuhk.edu.hk,"Fang, Kecheng/J-5844-2019","Fang, Kecheng/0000-0003-1674-1543",,,,,61,6,6,9,36,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1940-1612,1940-1620,,INT J PRESS/POLIT,Int.

Fundamental discursive differences between the two countries shape the visibility, resonance, and legitimacy of claims made on behalf of racially identified groups. A textual analysis of thirty-five articles from each country that discuss BLM and France published between 2015 and 2020 reveals that the US journalists commonly identify BLM activists as members of marginalized communities, interpret French circumstances as similar to the racial dynamics found in the United States, critique France's republican model of citizenship, and are relatively positively disposed toward BLM activity in France. By comparison, French coverage largely eschews identifying actors by racial identities, avoids or rejects comparisons with the United States, and at times contains implicit or explicit valorization of the French color-blind republican model, with some authors casting BLM as a product of the excesses of the American system. Our findings demonstrate the relevance of discursive opportunity structure theories to comparative media analysis, suggesting that coverage of race-based movements abroad may respond to different dynamics than coverage within the United States.","[Bleich, Erik; Pollard, Amelia] Middlebury Coll, Middlebury, VT 05753 USA; [van der Veen, A.

An important but under-recognized feature of such conflicts is the unique role performed by notions of rurality in the construction of environmental protests, discourses, and decisions; that is, the ways in which rural communities' conservation efforts can be unfairly characterized as backwards and anti-development. Through a series of interviews and focus groups with protestors and residents, our case study examines a controversial boat ramp development that had a marked environmental impact on the isolated coastal town of Mallacoota (population 1,000) in the state of Victoria, Australia. We show that the environmental activism of protesters lifted the issue's visibility to the level of regional, state, and national news and politics. But the community consultation processes that occurred in response to protests raise significant concerns about government decision making that fails to acknowledge and negotiate the diverse understandings of place and rurality that exist within a community. The outcomes of struggles for power in this small town are lamentable and lasting, damaging the hyperlocal news environment and undermining the community newspaper's reputation among citizens.","[Freeman, Julie] Deakin Univ, Fac Arts & Educ, Sch Commun & Creat Arts, 221 Burwood Highway, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia; [Hutchins, Brett] Monash Univ, Fac Arts, Sch Media Film & Journalism, Caulfield, Australia",Deakin University; Monash University,"Freeman, J (corresponding author), Deakin Univ, Fac Arts & Educ, Sch Commun & Creat Arts, 221 Burwood Highway, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia.",Julie.Freeman@deakin.edu.au,"Hutchins, Brett/U-4861-2017","Hutchins, Brett/0000-0002-8505-9620",,,,,36,0,0,0,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1940-1612,1940-1620,,INT J PRESS/POLIT,Int.

Increasing attention has been brought to the role of news media in the spread and uptake of misinformation, and to the role of journalists and news organizations in combatting this spread. Constructive journalism is a relatively new approach to reporting which, among other aims, looks to increase audience engagement, reduce polarization, and provide a more accurate view of events. In early 2020, we interviewed 16 journalism professionals from Europe (UK inclusive), Australia, Africa, and North America across a range formats to explore their perceptions of the use 'constructive' reporting strategies to address the spread of misinformation. We used thematic analysis to produce three themes and six subthemes in journalists' responses, 'apathy against the machine', with subthemes 'journalism as a moderator', and 'news and mental health'; 'standards as shared reality', with subthemes, 'pluralism not postmodernism', and 'this means information war'; and 'truth, trust, and the turn to transparency', with subthemes, 'facts necessary but not sufficient', and 'principles not particulars'. Constructive journalism was thought to address misinformation by increasing engagement with news and institutions, reducing polarization, providing a sense of shared reality amidst increasingly diverse perspectives, increasing trust, and reducing misperceptions encouraged by selection and reporting strategies. Constructive journalism may be a promising approach to addressing the spread and consequences of misinformation, however, empirical work is needed to evaluate the efficacy of the approach.","[van Antwerpen, Natasha; Turnbull, Deborah; Searston, Rachel A.] Univ Adelaide, Sch Psychol, Adelaide, SA, Australia",University of Adelaide,"van Antwerpen, N (corresponding author), Univ Adelaide, Hughes North Terrace, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",natasha.vanantwerpen@adelaide.edu.au,"van Antwerpen, Natasha/GRJ-7286-2022",,"Department of Education, Skills and Employment, Australian Government","Department of Education, Skills and Employment, Australian Government","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the Department of Education, Skills and Employment, Australian Government (grant number Research Training Program (RTP)).",,52,0,0,4,15,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1940-1612,1940-1620,,INT J PRESS/POLIT,Int.

Politicians have historically employed rhetoric and rhetorical spin to embellish the truth and hide damaging information. However, outright lying has traditionally been deemed politically too risky, resulting in resignation and the undermining of public trust. In contrast, recent electoral successes -the 2016 Brexit Referendum and the 2019 general election in the United Kingdom, and Trump's victory in 2016 and his increased electoral support in 2020-point to an apparent growing tendency for politicians caught lying not to be punished at the ballot box. Using the U.K. Brexit referendum and the 2019 general election as its case study, this conceptual paper argues that strategic political lying has been designed as a priming device to set the news agenda. As an effective campaigning tactic strategic lying represents a development of political spin-first evident in the mass media era-that has been intensified by the increasing professionalization of political communications and the rise of social media. In doing so, the concept of strategic lying theorized here contributes to deepening our understanding of the ongoing evolution of spin in the digital era.","[Gaber, Ivor; Fisher, Caroline] Univ Sussex, Sch Media Arts & Humanities, Brighton BN1 9RH, E Sussex, England; [Gaber, Ivor; Fisher, Caroline] Univ Canberra, News & Media Res Ctr, Fac Arts & Design, Canberra, ACT, Australia",University of Sussex; University of Canberra,"Fisher, C (corresponding author), Univ Canberra, News & Media Res Ctr, Fac Arts & Design, 9C11A,Kirinari St, Bruce, ACT 2617, Australia.",Caroline.Fisher@canberra.edu.au,,"Gaber, I/0000-0002-2425-3219; Fisher, Caroline/0000-0002-7443-3787",,,,,60,7,7,4,14,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1940-1612,1940-1620,,INT J PRESS/POLIT,Int.

However, relatively little is known about the mechanisms why specific news items are shared with the support base instead of others. For a timespan between December 2017 and the end of 2018, we combine the analysis of Facebook content from 1,022 politicians associated with 20 political parties from Germany, Spain, and the UK, with an automated content analysis of media coverage from 22 major online news outlets, and survey data in a multilevel binomial regression approach. By comparing news items that have been shared by one or several political parties with news items that have not been shared by any of them, we overcome the selection biases of previous studies in the field of news dissemination. Findings show that a news item's likelihood to be shared by a politician increases (1) if that politician's party is mentioned in the news item, (2) the more salient their party's owned issues are in the news item, and (3) the more party supporters tend to read the news outlet in which the news item is published. We contextualize these findings in light of political actors' multi-faceted motivations for news sharing on social media and discuss how this process potentially reinforces an information bias that may contribute to the polarization and fragmentation of audiences.","[Heidenreich, Tobias] WZB Berlin Social Sci Ctr, Berlin, Germany; [Eberl, Jakob-Moritz; Tolochko, Petro; Lind, Fabienne; Boomgaarden, Hajo G.] Univ Vienna, Dept Commun, Vienna, Austria; [Eberl, Jakob-Moritz] Ludwig Maximilian Univ Munich, Dept Media & Commun, Munich, Germany",University of Vienna; University of Munich,"Heidenreich, T (corresponding author), Reichpietschufer 50, D-10785 Berlin, Germany.",tobias.heidenreich@wzb.eu,"Lind, Fabienne/ABY-3927-2022; Eberl, Jakob-Moritz/K-4689-2019","Eberl, Jakob-Moritz/0000-0002-5613-760X; Heidenreich, Tobias/0000-0001-9070-0550; Tolochko, Petro/0000-0001-5971-8816; , Fabienne/0000-0002-4978-9415",Horizon 2020 Framework Programme [727072],Horizon 2020 Framework Programme,This work was supported by Horizon 2020 Framework Programme [grant number 727072].,,69,0,0,1,1,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1940-1612,1940-1620,,INT J PRESS/POLIT,Int.

In this paper, we examine the role of personality in various forms of political talk-online and offline-as well as like-minded discussion. Based on a 2017 survey conducted in the United Kingdom, United States, and France, we find that people who are open-minded and extraverted are more likely to engage in political talk but less likely to engage in like-minded discussion. Individuals who are older, less educated, introverted, and conscientious are more likely to find themselves in like-minded discussions, both online and on social media. Like-minded discussion is rare; personality, rather than ideology, predicts whether people engage in this form of political talk in online and offline modes. Our findings challenge the role of social media in the creation of like-minded discussion. Instead, we should look to the role of individual attributes, such as personality traits, which create a disposition that motivates the use of social media (and offline networks) to cultivate like-minded discussion.","[Boulianne, Shelley] MacEwan Univ, Dept Sociol, 6-394,City Ctr Campus,10700 104 Ave, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Koc-Michalska, Karolina] Audencia Business Sch, Commun & Culture Dept, Nantes, France; [Koc-Michalska, Karolina] Univ Silesia, Fac Social Sci, Katowice, Poland",Audencia; University of Silesia in Katowice,"Boulianne, S (corresponding author), MacEwan Univ, Dept Sociol, 6-394,City Ctr Campus,10700 104 Ave, Edmonton, AB, Canada.",sjboulianne@gmail.com,,"Koc-Michalska, Karolina/0000-0002-5354-5616",Audencia Foundation; MacEwan University,Audencia Foundation; MacEwan University,This project was funded by the Audencia Foundation and MacEwan University.

A census of reporting on the protests (N = 369) was content analyzed. Results demonstrate that news agencies varied considerably in their portrayal of issues defined as problems, diagnosis of causes, moral evaluations, and treatment recommendations. Reporting by Xinhua differed considerably from Western news agencies and featured a greater proportion of stories recommending maintenance of the status quo in Iran. Calls for political change received more attention in privately owned news agencies based in democratic nations. While the use of sources in news stories was generally similar across agencies, protesters were absent in reporting by state-owned agencies. Results conclude that differences in national interests and/or ownership of global news agencies may explain findings and provide insight into news reporting on foreign protest.","[Adegbola, Oluseyi] Depaul Univ, Coll Commun, 14E Jackson Blvd,Suite 1247, Chicago, IL 60604 USA; [Gearhart, Sherice] Texas Tech Univ, Coll Media & Commun, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA; [Cho, Janice] Stephen F Austin State Univ, Dept Mass Commun, Nacogdoches, TX 75962 USA",DePaul University; Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University,"Adegbola, O (corresponding author), Depaul Univ, Coll Commun, 14E Jackson Blvd,Suite 1247, Chicago, IL 60604 USA.",oadegbol@depaul.edu,,"Gearhart, Sherice/0000-0003-1504-4594",,,,,74,0,0,6,18,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1940-1612,1940-1620,,INT J PRESS/POLIT,Int.

Using a quasi-experimental design, we test the effect of source flagging on people's actual sharing behaviors. By analyzing tweets (N = 49,126) posted by 30 China's media accounts before and after Twitter's practice of labeling state-affiliated media, we reveal the corrective role that flagging plays in preventing people's sharing of information from propaganda sources. The findings suggest that the corrective effect occurs immediately after these accounts are labeled as state-affiliated media and it leads to a long-term reduction in news sharing, particularly for political content. The results contribute to the understanding of how flagging efforts affect user engagement in real-world conversations and highlight that the effect of corrective measures takes place in a dynamic process.","[Liang, Fan] Duke Kunshan Univ, Div Social Sci, Kunshan, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Qinfeng] Univ Groningen, Dept Media Studies & Journalism, Groningen, Netherlands; [Li, Gabriel Miao] Univ Michigan, Dept Commun & Media, Ann Arbor, MI USA",Duke Kunshan University; University of Groningen; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Liang, F (corresponding author), Duke Kunshan Univ, Innovat Bldg 3038,8 Duke Ave, Kunshan 215316, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",fan.liang@duke.edu,"Zhu, Qinfeng/AAA-8996-2022","Zhu, Qinfeng/0000-0001-8038-0274; Li, Gabriel Miao/0000-0002-9142-8154; Liang, Fan/0000-0001-5169-2623",,,,,29,0,0,2,9,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1940-1612,1940-1620,,INT J PRESS/POLIT,Int.

However, while the existence of selective exposure has been documented in both offline and online environments, the evidence of its extent and its impact on political polarisation is far from unanimous. To address these questions, and also to bridge methodological and geographical gaps in existing research, this paper adopts a media repertoires approach to investigate selective news exposure and polarisation in four Eastern European countries - the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Serbia. Using a combination of population surveys, expert surveys and qualitative interviews, the data for the study were collected between November 2019 and May 2020. We identify five types of news repertoires based on their relative openness to counter-attitudinal sources, and show that selective news repertoires are present in 29% of the entire sample. Our findings also reveal significant cross-country differences, with the more selective news repertoires more prominent in countries characterised by higher levels of polarisation. Furthermore, while the selection of news sources is in line with people's electoral (and to a lesser extent ideological) preferences, our findings show that exposure to counter-attitudinal sources can also be strongly correlated with political and ideological leanings. Our qualitative data suggest that this is because exposure to counter-attitudinal sources can reinforce attitudes, and potentially contribute to polarisation. Qualitative data also highlight the influence of environmental factors (e.g., family), and suggest that selective news consumption is associated with normatively different conceptions of media trust.","[Toth, Fanni; Mihelj, Sabina; Stetka, Vaclav; Kondor, Katherine] Loughborough Univ, Loughborough, Leics, England",Loughborough University,"Stetka, V (corresponding author), Loughborough Univ, Sch Social Sci & Humanities, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England.",V.Stetka@lboro.ac.uk,,,Economic and Social Research Council [ES/S01019X/1],Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the Economic and Social Research Council (grant number ES/S01019X/1).",,59,0,0,10,13,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1940-1612,1940-1620,,INT J PRESS/POLIT,Int.

We begin with an agent-based model, which shows that congenial evidence-based exchanges polarize the network and the inclusion of identity-driven communications leads to greater polarization. Once out-group derogation reaches a certain threshold, the network of agents splits into two groups, yet the polarizing effects of in-group praise are yet stronger and emerge more rapidly (i.e., a lower threshold of in-group praise is needed to polarize the network). Using an experimental design on a sample of American partisans, we offer a partial validation of the model. In-group praise and out-group derogation polarize attitudes more than balanced evidence-based news, but not more than congenial evidence-based news. Identity-driven news also has no effects on affective polarization. This multidisciplinary evidence shows that the nature of political content matters.","[Wojcieszak, Magdalena; Yu, Xudong; Bulat, Beril] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Commun, One Shields Ave,Kerr Hall 478, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Wojcieszak, Magdalena] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Sobkowicz, Pawel] Natl Ctr Nucl Res, NOMATEN MAB, Otwock, Poland",University of California System; University of California Davis; University of Amsterdam; National Centre for Nuclear Research,"Wojcieszak, M (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Commun, One Shields Ave,Kerr Hall 478, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",mwojcieszak@ucdavis.edu,,,European Union [857470]; European Regional Development Fundvia Foundation for Polish Science International Research Agenda PLUS programme [MAB PLUS/2018/8]; European Research Council [EXPO-756301],European Union(European Commission); European Regional Development Fundvia Foundation for Polish Science International Research Agenda PLUS programme; European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)European Commission),"The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The work was partially supported by the European Union Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (grant agreement No 857470), by European Regional Development Fundvia Foundation for Polish Science International Research Agenda PLUS programme (grant No MAB PLUS/2018/8), and by European Research Council, Europeans exposed to dissimilar views in the media: investigating backfire effects (EXPO-756301).",,84,1,1,7,27,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1940-1612,1940-1620,,INT J PRESS/POLIT,Int.

Trust seems even more important in today's digital society, where the destabilization of journalism institutions and proliferation of sources make the media ecology increasingly complex to navigate. This paper challenges such conceptualizations of media trust rooted in rationality and deliberateness. Based on two series of semistructured interviews with fifty-five young people from ten nationalities living in the Netherlands, conducted in 2016 and 2017, we develop a taxonomy of people's tactics when assessing the reliability of news. We explore what this means for how they value news and how such judgments, drawing on explicit and tacit knowledge, impact their news use. Rather than critically evaluating news through comparing and checking sources, users often employ more pragmatic shortcuts to approximate the trustworthiness of news, including affective and intuitive tactics rooted in tacit knowledge. Consequently, we argue that to fully understand how users deal with the complexity of trust in digital environments, we should not start from ideals of informed citizenship, but from people's actual practices and experiences instead.","[Swart, Joelle; Broersma, Marcel] Univ Groningen, Ctr Media & Journalism Studies, Oude Kijk In't Jatstr 26, NL-9712 EK Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen,"Swart, J (corresponding author), Univ Groningen, Ctr Media & Journalism Studies, Oude Kijk In't Jatstr 26, NL-9712 EK Groningen, Netherlands.",j.a.c.swart@rug.nl,,"Broersma, Marcel/0000-0002-7342-3472",,,,,64,12,12,4,11,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1940-1612,1940-1620,,INT J PRESS/POLIT,Int.

In this paper, we examine whether and how information flows across borders despite government censorship. We develop a semi-automated system that combines deep learning and human annotation to find co-occurring content across different social media platforms and languages. We use this system to detect co-occurring content between Twitter and Sina Weibo as Covid-19 spread globally, and we conduct in-depth investigations of co-occurring content to identify those that constitute an inflow of information from the global information ecosystem into China. We find that approximately one-fourth of content with relevance for China that gains widespread public attention on Twitter makes its way to Weibo. Unsurprisingly, Chinese state-controlled media and commercialized domestic media play a dominant role in facilitating these inflows of information. However, we find that Weibo users without traditional media or government affiliations are also an important mechanism for transmitting information into China. These results imply that while censorship combined with media control provide substantial leeway for the government to set the agenda, social media provides opportunities for non-institutional actors to influence the information environment. Methodologically, the system we develop offers a new approach for the quantitative analysis of cross-platform and cross-lingual communication.","[Lu, Yingdan; Pan, Jennifer] Stanford Univ, Dept Commun, 450 Jane Stanford Way,Bldg 120,Room 110, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Schaefer, Jack; Joo, Jungseock] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Commun, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Park, Kunwoo] Soongsil Univ, Sch AI Convergence, Seoul, South Korea",Stanford University; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; Soongsil University,"Pan, J (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Commun, 450 Jane Stanford Way,Bldg 120,Room 110, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",jp1@stanford.edu,"Lu, Yingdan/AAY-5538-2020","Lu, Yingdan/0000-0002-9955-6070; Pan, Jennifer/0000-0002-4818-0122","National Science Foundation [1831481, 1831848]; Stanford Graduate Fellowship; Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education [2021R1F1A1062691]","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Stanford Graduate Fellowship(Stanford University); Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education(National Research Foundation of KoreaMinistry of Education (MOE), Republic of KoreaNational Research Council for Economics, Humanities & Social Sciences, Republic of Korea)","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the National Science Foundation SBE/SMA No. 1831481, No. 1831848 RIDIR: Collaborative Research: Integrated Communication Database and Computational Tools.

Yet growing scholarship on news avoidance suggests many people still manage to consume little news, and algorithmic curation may decrease the likelihood that they will be exposed to it incidentally. In this article, we put the literatures on INE, news avoidance, and political talk into dialogue with one another. Then, by inductively analyzing over a hundred in-depth interviews conducted from 2016 to 2020 with news avoiders in the UK, Spain, and the United States, we explore how they encounter news incidentally and to what extent they feel the news is accessible and available to them. Our audience-centric approach highlights that interviewees often did not make a clear distinction between direct encounters with professional news (firsthand news) and discussions of news (secondhand news), especially online. When they did make a distinction, the latter was often more salient for them. We also find that just as news consumers have repertoires of news sources on which they habitually rely, news avoiders have repertoires of sources for incidental exposure to news to stay informed about major events and anything that might affect them directly. And yet, those repertoires catch only the biggest and most sensational stories of the day and do little to help them contextualize or understand the news they encounter, contributing to their sense that news is neither entirely absent nor ambient in the way scholars have theorized.","[Palmer, Ruth] IE Univ, Commun & Digital Media, Segovia, Spain; [Toff, Benjamin] Univ Minnesota, Hubbard Sch Journalism & Mass Commun, Minneapolis, MN USA",IE University; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Palmer, R (corresponding author), IE Univ, Calle Cardenal Zuniga 12, Segovia 40003, Spain.",rpalmer@faculty.ie.edu,,"Palmer, Ruth/0000-0002-5373-234X",University of Minnesota [287402]; Google UK as part of the Digital News Initiative [CTR00220],University of Minnesota(University of Minnesota System); Google UK as part of the Digital News Initiative(Google Incorporated),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by grants from the University of Minnesota (Grant-in-Aid award #287402) and Google UK as part of the Digital News Initiative (CTR00220).",,68,0,0,11,11,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1940-1612,1940-1620,,INT J PRESS/POLIT,Int.

To test our theory, we construct a new dataset that characterizes leader communication through social media posts published by any head of state or government on Twitter or Facebook, employing a combination of automated translation and supervised machine learning methods. Our findings show that leaders increase their social media activity and shift the topic from domestic to foreign policy issues during moments of social unrest, which is consistent with a conscious strategy to divert public attention when their position could be at risk. These effects are larger in democracies and in particular in the run-up to elections, which we attribute to incentives created by democratic institutions.

This despite scholarship on sources being vital to our understanding of how journalists gain the raw materials to produce stories about events. Thus, while scholarship has begun taking Africa's coverage of itself seriously, there has been a slower uptick in focusing on whom African journalists give voice to as co-constructors of events. This silence is even more perplexing, considering that scholars and observers have been critical of who is quoted as a source when the global north covers events unfolding in Africa. This paper shows that African suffering was made legible for African audiences through a combination of American, English, and Sudanese voices. Specifically, it finds that African journalists are -counterintuitively - vital players in silencing some African voices in their construction of knowledge about the atrocities in Darfur. Despite the criticism leveled at journalism fields in the global north over their perceived silencing of African voices, African journalists are similarly engaged in this silencing as well.","[Wahutu, j Siguru] NYU, Media Culture & Commun, New York, NY 10012 USA; [Wahutu, j Siguru] Harvard Univ, Berkman Klein Ctr Internet & Soc, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",New York University; Harvard University,"Wahutu, JS (corresponding author), NYU, Media Culture & Commun, New York, NY 10012 USA.;Wahutu, JS (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Berkman Klein Ctr Internet & Soc, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",jswahutu@nyu.edu,,,,,,,93,0,0,0,1,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1940-1612,1940-1620,,INT J PRESS/POLIT,Int.

Despite much research on the topic, the expectations of journalistic news by young adults who have turned their back on traditional news media remain unclear. We use a novel multimethod qualitative online study design to investigate the perceived quality, functions, and expectations toward journalistic news of young adults in Switzerland who use social media as their main source for news and rarely consume traditional media. Nineteen young adults between 20 and 25 years of age with different educational levels participated in our study in May 2020. Our results show that even though the participants only occasionally use traditional news media channels, they still consider journalistic news relevant and appreciate quality standards of professional journalism such as actuality and veracity (Swart 2021b). Among the functions of news, the participants highlighted sociability and identification. Exchange and discussion of news are, thus, of high relevance online but also offline. Also, the participants show a high affinity toward news on mobilizing topics, which are of interest to themselves and their peers, and motivate them to engage with news more intensely. According to the participants, news should be attractively prepared, such as with audiovisual formats and easy to understand and integrate into everyday life. The participants also expressed a preference to consume news articles from different media brands within a single platform. Our study outlines a fruitful path for comprehensive qualitative research with innovative online tools.","[Schwaiger, Lisa; Vogler, Daniel; Eisenegger, Mark] Univ Zurich, Dept Commun & Media Res IKMZ, Res Ctr Publ Sphere & Soc Fog, Andreasstr 15, CH-8050 Zurich, Switzerland",University of Zurich,"Schwaiger, L (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Dept Commun & Media Res IKMZ, Res Ctr Publ Sphere & Soc Fog, Andreasstr 15, CH-8050 Zurich, Switzerland.",l.schwaiger@ikmz.uzh.ch,,"Schwaiger, Lisa/0000-0003-4920-7881",,,,,59,1,1,6,10,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1940-1612,1940-1620,,INT J PRESS/POLIT,Int.

This online survey experiment of White men (N = 421) examines the effects of messenger gender (man or woman) and race (Black or White) on perceptions of the messenger and subsequent movement attitudes and behavior intentions. Results show that White men found women #MeToo advocates to be more sexist than men advocates, which reduced their #MeToo movement solidarity, collective action intentions, and bystander intervention intentions.

The primary hypotheses are that 1) motivational relevance shapes facilitation or inhibition of behaviors while interacting with virtual objects, and that 2) approach-avoidance can be quantified using spatial and temporal aspects of behavior in VR. An experiment was conducted to track and examine user behaviors during a virtual photo-sorting task that used images with varying valence and arousal levels. Spatial indicators of approach and avoidance were operationalized as the distance between the individual and the photo during the task. Temporal indicators were operationalized as the speed and latency of gazing at the objects, selection order, and sorting behavior. Results show that stimulus valence and arousal significantly affect speed and latency during object selection, demonstrating motivational reactions to virtual objects. Exploratory analyses also revealed varying patterns of object selection across individuals. Overall, this study has implications for the design of virtual environments and supports the use of VR technology in studying motivational processes and behaviors relevant for media psychologists.","[Lee, Joomi] Univ Georgia, Advertising & Publ Relat, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Eden, Allison; Bente, Gary] Michigan State Univ, Commun, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Park, Taiwoo; Ewoldsen, David R.] Michigan State Univ, Media & Informat, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; Michigan State University; Michigan State University,"Lee, J (corresponding author), Univ Georgia, Advertising & Publ Relat, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",leejoomi@msu.edu,"Eden, Allison/E-7246-2011","Eden, Allison/0000-0003-0846-2739",,,,,51,1,1,2,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1521-3269,1532-785X,,MEDIA PSYCHOL,Media Psychol.,44685,2022,25,3,,,,,387,410,,10.1080/15213269.2021.1968439,0,,44440,24,"Communication; Film, Radio, Television; Psychology, Applied",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI),"Communication; Film, Radio & Television; Psychology",0U5AY,,,,,44885,WOS:000692287800001,0

As a specific demanding situation, it focused on the experience of cyber-ostracism, defined as not receiving replies from others on a sent message. Hypotheses were derived from the temporal need-threat model. To test these hypotheses, 214 participants answered 1,378 questionnaires over the course of one week. The results have shown that being cyber-ostracized via messengers (e.g., WhatsApp) was negatively associated with the satisfaction of users' needs for belonging, self-esteem, meaningful existence, and control. Moreover, mediated via these needs, there was a negative indirect association between cyber-ostracism and well-being. Messenger users' trait mindfulness served as a buffering mechanism: For mindful users, low satisfaction of the need for meaningful existence was not associated with decreased eudaimonic well-being. Moreover, although messengers were perceived as a source of exclusion, cyber-ostracized users reported an increased desire to use these services on the respective following day, representing an approach coping tendency.

Cognitive processing fluency, access to reliable web-based information, and actively searching for information are shown in a series of experiments to be associated with judgments related to metacognition and task performance. In the context of online information repositories accessed via web search activities, people are shown to (a) overemphasize the degree to which they find the web to be a ready source of relevant information, (b) overestimate their future task performance and the ease of tasks, and (c) inflate their own perceived cognitive and memory abilities. Results also show that those who are least competent in task completion overestimate their relative performance, whereas the most competent underestimate theirs, and that the availability of web-based information can inflate people's estimated performance, particularly among the more competent.

Epistemic monitoring may detect inconsistencies that arise during bridging and elaboration, and these inconsistencies may interfere with comprehension and the construction of mental models. The present study links these processes with readers' perceptions of narrative and external realism. It investigates the influence of inconsistencies - references to modern technologies in written short stories set before those technologies existed - on two types of realism judgments and on five dimensions of narrative engagement. Experimentally introduced inconsistencies designed to interfere with elaboration and, subsequently with the construction of a story world model, reduced perceived external realism and narrative realism. The effect on narrative realism was mediated by external realism. Results further indicate that narrative realism causally preceded imagery production, and that imagery production fully mediated the relation between narrative realism and emotional engagement, and partially mediated the relation between narrative realism and a sense of presence in the story.","[Busselle, Rick] Bowling Green State Univ, Bowling Green, OH 43403 USA; [Vierrether, Tanja] Rollins Coll, Winter Pk, FL 32789 USA",University System of Ohio; Bowling Green State University; Rollins College,"Busselle, R (corresponding author), Bowling Green State Univ, Bowling Green, OH 43403 USA.",busself@bgsu.edu,,"Vierrether, Tanja/0000-0003-3066-1523",,,,,66,2,2,3,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1521-3269,1532-785X,,MEDIA PSYCHOL,Media Psychol.,44807,2022,25,5,,,,,689,705,,10.1080/15213269.2022.2032180,0,,44593,17,"Communication; Film, Radio, Television; Psychology, Applied",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI),"Communication; Film, Radio & Television; Psychology",4A2OR,,,,,44885,WOS:000749464200001,0

In an experiment among 48 children aged 10-13 years old, we made a distinction between children's conceptual advertising literacy (i.e., knowledge of advertising) and attitudinal advertising literacy (i.e., critical attitude toward advertising). By using a within-subjects design, participants were primed with either television commercials (advertising condition) or a news broadcast (control condition). Advertising literacy activation was assessed with the Advertising Literacy Activation Task (ALAT), inhibitory control with a Go/No Go Task, and susceptibility with both an Approach-Avoidance Task (to assess implicit desire for the advertised products) and a questionnaire measurement (to assess explicit desire for the advertised products). The results showed that the relation between both conceptual and attitudinal advertising literacy activation and implicit desire for the advertised products was moderated by inhibitory control. Inhibitory control not only diminished the direct positive effect of advertising literacy activation on implicit desire, but even reversed it. No effects of advertising literacy activation and inhibitory control were found on explicit advertised product desire.

Extant research, however, has shown that perceptions of risk are not necessarily correlated with the level of actual risk, including that of COVID-19. Informed by the social amplification of risk framework (SARF), we test whether having a parasocial relationship with a celebrity who has COVID-19 makes the risk of contracting the virus more real, thus amplifying the perceived susceptibility to the virus and reducing the biased sense of optimism that one is safe. Findings from Study 1, a national survey (N = 493), suggest that having a parasocial friend contract COVID-19, is related to increased perceived susceptibility, especially for those for whom it would otherwise seem abstract and vague.

By conducting two online experiments, we study perceived source vividness as a psychological mechanism of the effect of AI-enabled deepfake news on news credibility and engagement intentions. Furthermore, we test how an inserted false-tag onto the fake news can reduce the impact of source vividness experienced by seeing multimodal disinformation on news credibility and engagement intentions. The results suggest that participants who saw deepfake news had higher source vividness than those who saw fake news with other modalities (i.e., text-only and text-photo), and such source vividness increased credibility and engagement intentions of fake news. The false-tag successfully reduced engagement intentions of deepfake news for those who perceived a high vividness of the superimposed interviewee.","[Lee, Jiyoung] Univ Alabama, Coll Commun & Informat Sci, Dept Journalism & Creat Media, 486C Reese Phifer Hall, Tuscaloosa, AL 35404 USA; [Shin, Soo Yun] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Communicol, Honolulu, HI USA",University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa,"Lee, J (corresponding author), Univ Alabama, Coll Commun & Informat Sci, Dept Journalism & Creat Media, 486C Reese Phifer Hall, Tuscaloosa, AL 35404 USA.",jlee284@ua.edu,,"Shin, Soo Yun/0000-0002-2678-7388",University of Alabama; University of Hawaii at Manoa,University of Alabama; University of Hawaii at Manoa,This work was supported by The University of Alabama and University of Hawaii at Manoa.,,51,2,2,19,33,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1521-3269,1532-785X,,MEDIA PSYCHOL,Media Psychol.,44746,2022,25,4,,,,,531,546,,10.1080/15213269.2021.2007489,0,,44531,16,"Communication; Film, Radio, Television; Psychology, Applied",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI),"Communication; Film, Radio & Television; Psychology",2U3QP,,,,,44885,WOS:000729027400001,0

However, unaddressed questions remain, particularly what types of alcohol references (i.e., alcohol use vs. intoxication) have such influence, and whether the association between sharing alcohol references on social media and drinking behavior is a within-person effect, or rather reflects group differences. The current study (N = 338) used secondary data analysis of a four-wave longitudinal dataset collected as part of a larger project, which evaluated college students' Facebook profiles and their alcohol use across their college experience. Using a random intercept cross-lagged panel analysis, we found empirical support for a positive relationship between sharing alcohol references and alcohol use at between-person level rather than the within-person level. Moreover, there was a negative relationship between sharing intoxication alcohol references on Facebook and alcohol use at the within-person level. This means that we find more support for the idea that the association between sharing alcohol references on social media and drinking behavior reflects group differences, rather than true self-effect of social media use.","[Geusens, Femke] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Leuven Sch Mass Commun Res, Parkstr 45 Bus 3603, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium; [Geusens, Femke] Res Fdn Flanders FWO Vlaanderen, Brussels, Belgium; [Chen, Y.

A multiple informant methodology was used. 314 Italian and Dutch PNAs users answered an online questionnaire about their local social needs (bridging social capital, loneliness, sense of community) and their neighborhood social and environmental characteristics. Results show that community-related PNAs use facilitates users to meet their social needs when their local community offers opportunities for social interaction. When the neighborhood offers social places, the relationship between PNAS use and loneliness increases, indicating that in such cases people are willing to use PNAS to counter their loneliness. Furthermore, when neighbors are already more supportive, the relationship between sense of community and PNAS use becomes more negative, which may mean PNAS use cannot further add to a sense of community if the neighborhood already provides this; conversely, the one between bridging social capital and PNAS use becomes more positive. In sum, results show that PNAS use is related to local community experiences, albeit contingent upon the specific neighborhood characteristics.","[Gatti, Flora; Procentese, Fortuna] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Humanities, Via Porta Massa 1, I-80133 Naples, Italy; [Schouten, Alexander P.] Tilburg Univ, Dept Commun & Cognit, Tilburg, Netherlands",University of Naples Federico II; Tilburg University,"Gatti, F (corresponding author), Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Humanities, Via Porta Massa 1, I-80133 Naples, Italy.",flora.gatti@unina.it,,,,,,,60,0,0,1,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1521-3269,1532-785X,,MEDIA PSYCHOL,Media Psychol.,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1080/15213269.2022.2139272,0,,44835,28,"Communication; Film, Radio, Television; Psychology, Applied",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI),"Communication; Film, Radio & Television; Psychology",5V4YZ,,,,,44885,WOS:000877237300001,0

While mounting evidence suggests enhanced empathy following exposure to written, fictional narratives, the present study expands this line of research to the context of fictional serial audiovisual narratives. Considering that social interactions are instrumental for empathic development, vicarious interactions are proposed as a key mechanism in the relationship between exposure to fictional audiovisual narratives and empathy. Furthermore, the empathy-enhancing role of exposure to eudaimonic entertainment in particular is assessed. Additionally, possible boundary conditions are explored with respect to personality traits linked to reduced empathy. The conducted analyses combine logged data from participants' Netflix viewing histories with self-report data from an online survey (N = 262). Results suggest that exposure to fictional serial audiovisual narratives predicts empathy via vicarious interactions. Moreover, eudaimonic experiences positively predict vicarious interactions and empathy. The role of specific media content, instead of mere exposure time, is therefore discussed with respect to the facilitation of media enhanced empathy.","[Rohm, S.; Smit, E.

However, people often avoid such contact, including avoiding outgroup media messages. In two studies, we investigated voluntary exposure to outgroup media. Our research builds on intergroup contact theory and the reactive approach model. The latter suggests (counterintuitively) that, sometimes, anxiety can motivate people to engage with the unfamiliar. Both studies measured potential predictors of voluntary contact, provided musical options for respondents, and measured which options people chose as well as their engagement with and enjoyment of those choices. Study 1 provided a simple choice between two musical options (ingroup versus outgroup); Study 2 used a more extensive array of ingroup and outgroup options, including ingroup-outgroup collaborative music. Findings suggest a limited role of personality traits in determining seeking outgroup media, but a more powerful role for diversity-related attitudes and past exposure to outgroup media.

This analysis examines how non-Black participants view helping behavior by Black individuals, and how their interpretations of helping scenarios influence intergroup attitudes. Participants (n= 211) were randomly assigned to view a news clip in which a Black or White hero saves someone White, or whose race was not portrayed. When viewing a clip with an ambiguous victim, participants were significantly more likely to report that the victim was not White when the hero was Black - indicating an expectation of helping behavior between Whites and Blacks. However, when a Black hero saved an unambiguously White victim, participants were more accurate in their recall. Victim race recall and hero race interacted to predict future reciprocity expectations, such that Black heroes saving a victim recalled as White (regardless of accuracy) resulted in increased positive reciprocity expectations. Positive reciprocity then predicted motivation to avoid prejudice and prejudiced attitudes. These results have implications for how media depictions of helping behaviors may impact intergroup beliefs and attitudes.","[Ellithorpe, Morgan E.] Univ Delaware, Dept Commun, 125 Acad St, Newark, DE 19716 USA; [Holt, Lanier F.] Ohio State Univ, Sch Commun, Columbus, OH USA; [Ewoldsen, David R.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Media & Informat, E Lansing, MI USA",University of Delaware; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; Michigan State University,"Ellithorpe, ME (corresponding author), Univ Delaware, Dept Commun, 125 Acad St, Newark, DE 19716 USA.",mellitho@udel.edu,,,,,,,58,0,0,3,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1521-3269,1532-785X,,MEDIA PSYCHOL,Media Psychol.,44867,2022,25,6,,,,,814,830,,10.1080/15213269.2022.2078842,0,,44682,17,"Communication; Film, Radio, Television; Psychology, Applied",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI),"Communication; Film, Radio & Television; Psychology",5R4FI,,,,,44885,WOS:000798683700001,0

Two typologies of motivations are tested (one from a hierarchy of psychological needs perspective, and the other from the professional field of screenwriting) as predictors of dynamic fluctuations in audience identification and liking. Three professional screenwriters served as expert coders of three randomly selected films and identified key moments that were of particular importance for establishing character motivation. N = 308 participants viewed the first 35 minutes of one of the three films and provided real-time ratings of either liking or identification. Results indicated that the establishment of character motivations does indeed have a major impact on shaping identification and liking in real time.","[Tchernev, John M.] Miami Univ, Dept Media Journalism & Film, Oxford, OH 45056 USA",University System of Ohio; Miami University,"Tchernev, JM (corresponding author), Miami Univ, Dept Media Journalism & Film, Oxford, OH 45056 USA.",tchernjm@miamioh.edu,,"Tchernev, John/0000-0001-6468-549X",,,,,90,0,0,5,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1521-3269,1532-785X,,MEDIA PSYCHOL,Media Psychol.,44807,2022,25,5,,,,,740,761,,10.1080/15213269.2022.2067878,0,,44682,22,"Communication; Film, Radio, Television; Psychology, Applied",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI),"Communication; Film, Radio & Television; Psychology",4A2OR,,,,,44885,WOS:000790654200001,0

Toxic behavior significantly worsened the multivariate vector of team and individual performance. Motivation influenced baseline individual performance but did not significantly moderate the effect of toxic behavior on individual performance.

In Experiment 1 (N= 391), we reminded users of the unrealistic nature of most Instagram posts in a 2 (intervention: disclaimer vs. control) x 2 (Instagram profile: upward vs. downward comparison standard) between-subjects design. Positive and negative affect, envy, self-esteem, and well-being served as dependent variables. Experiment 2 (N= 184) explored whether slightly longer cognitive interventions (cognitive bias vs. growth mindset vs. control) could improve participants' experience of upward comparisons, shielding them against envy or the loss of self-esteem. Both experiments included social comparison orientation (SCO) as a potential moderator. Results show that eliciting upward comparisons indeed evoked more envy, with SCO moderating the effect. We further observed indirect effects of the shown Instagram profiles on positive affect, envy, self-esteem, and well-being via participants' social comparison experience. Concerning the cognitive interventions, however, we report that neither an authoritative disclaimer, nor educating users about cognitive biases or mindsets significantly reduced the negative consequences of social comparisons.","[Weber, Silvana; Messingschlager, Tanja; Stein, Jan-Philipp] Univ Wurzburg, Psychol Commun & New Media, Wurzburg, Germany",University of Wurzburg,"Weber, S (corresponding author), Julius Maximilians Univ Wurzburg, Psychol Commun & New Media, Oswald Kulpe Weg 82, D-97074 Wurzburg, Germany.",silvana.weber@uni-wuerzburg.de,"Stein, Jan-Philipp/AAT-6178-2020; Weber, Silvana/AAX-8779-2020","Stein, Jan-Philipp/0000-0003-3874-0277; Weber, Silvana/0000-0002-0911-5686",German Society for Online Research [Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Online-Forschung e.V.],German Society for Online Research [Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Online-Forschung e.V.],"This work was supported by the German Society for Online Research [Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Online-Forschung e.V.].

Extending previous research on the destigmatizing effects of empathy, we investigated the effects of three content factors (mental illness portrayed: autism vs. schizophrenia; background music: emotional vs. neutral; veracity: actual vs. enacted portrayals) on empathy, reflective thoughts, and attitudes toward persons with mental illness.

These results draw attention to the role of reflectiveness in mediating empathy-attitude effects, but also shed light on the effect of authentic testimonials' self-disclosure.

Based on a metacognitive response framework and extant discussions based on the Heuristic-Systematic Model vs. the Elaboration Likelihood Model, we tested whether a reader's initial expectation of a message characteristic and stable individual differences intersect with the metacognitive processing fluency experience. Do people recall more information from the news when presented with articles that are more - or less - complex than they expected, or do they recall more information when expectations of article complexity are met? And for whom is this more likely to occur? Our results provide strong support for the notion that objective complexity is indeed the main driver of metacognitive perceptual processing fluency and information recall, while also rending partial support for the role of (in)congruency in this process. The results also showed that individual differences in processing capabilities play a significant role in shaping information recall.

Study 1 (college student sample) found support for a relationship between lifetime television exposure and negative attitudes, mediated by negative reciprocity beliefs. Study 2 (U.S. adult sample) found support for an ambivalence effect, where lifetime television exposure was associated with increases in both positive and negative reciprocity beliefs. This indicates that reciprocity beliefs can be cultivated similarly to other kinds of beliefs (e.g., crime frequency, mean world), and that these beliefs have downstream relationships with racial attitudes. The direction in which they are influenced by television use remains an open question, and likely depends on TV content patterns over time.","[Holt, Lanier F.] Ohio State Univ, Sch Commun, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Ellithorpe, Morgan E.] Univ Delaware, Dept Commun, Pearson Hall,125 Acad St, Newark, DE 19716 USA; [Ewoldsen, David R.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Media & Informat, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Velez, John] Indiana Univ, Media Sch, Bloomington, IN USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University of Delaware; Michigan State University; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Ellithorpe, ME (corresponding author), Univ Delaware, Dept Commun, Pearson Hall,125 Acad St, Newark, DE 19716 USA.",mellitho@udel.edu,,,,,,,70,1,1,2,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1521-3269,1532-785X,,MEDIA PSYCHOL,Media Psychol.,44807,2022,25,5,,,,,675,688,,10.1080/15213269.2022.2026228,0,,44593,14,"Communication; Film, Radio, Television; Psychology, Applied",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI),"Communication; Film, Radio & Television; Psychology",4A2OR,,,,,44885,WOS:000750366700001,0

A majority of children were reported to be negatively emotionally affected (frightened, disturbed, or upset) by news coverage of COVID-19. Every stress symptom asked about (including nervousness, crying, and sleep problems) was dramatically more prevalent among children frightened than not frightened by the coverage. Open-ended questions illustrated the emotional depths of some responses. Developmental differences occurred in elements of coverage seen to influence fright. Most parents of frightened children tried to help their child cope, but their choices of strategies were only partially consistent with developmental expectations. Children with digital devices in their bedroom showed greater fear; more hours of COVID news were transmitted in homes with frightened than unfrightened children; and the relationship between media access and children's fear intensity and stress symptoms remained after controlling for parents' own fear and parents' closeness with people diagnosed with COVID. Parents are encouraged to monitor children's exposure to media-conveyed catastrophes, to be mindful of potential age differences in child responses, and to be available to help children cope.","[Cantor, Joanne] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Commun Arts, Madison, WI 53716 USA; [Harrison, Kristen] Univ Michigan, LSA Commun & Media, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Cantor, J (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin Madison, 5205 Tonyawatha Trail, Monona, WI 53716 USA.",jrcantor@wisc.edu,,"Cantor, Joanne/0000-0003-4902-3759","College of Literature, Science, and the Arts at the University of Michigan","College of Literature, Science, and the Arts at the University of Michigan","We thank the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts at the University of Michigan for funding, and we thank Sam Schefka and Siqi Zhou for their valuable coding of the narratives.",,27,1,1,3,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1521-3269,1532-785X,,MEDIA PSYCHOL,Media Psychol.,44746,2022,25,4,,,,,565,582,,10.1080/15213269.2021.2009878,0,,44562,18,"Communication; Film, Radio, Television; Psychology, Applied",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI),"Communication; Film, Radio & Television; Psychology",2U3QP,,Green Submitted,,,44885,WOS:000739715800001,0

The inability of these campaigns to counter the marketing resources of the mainstream fast-food chains is among the primary explanations for such failures. However, from the information processing perspective, the message's features may also play a significant role. Cue reactivity research has shown the importance of evaluating visual and verbal cues to avoid undesirable addictive behavioral outcomes. Bridging the evaluative space model (ESM) and the limited capacity model of motivated mediated message processing (LC4MP), the goal of this experiment is to further explore how food-related visual and verbal cues elicit psychophysiological reactivity and how this reactivity in turn affects attitudes toward the promotion. Multilevel modeling results showed that healthy food images paired with encouragement words elicited an uncoupled pattern of the appetitive system activation and received a predominantly positive attitude from audiences (N = 180). Results suggested that thematic congruent messages are preferred in health communication settings. Junk food images, regardless of being paired with encouragement or discouragement verbal cues, should be avoided due to their automatic activation of the appetitive motivational system.","[Liu, Mingxuan] Univ Southern Calif, Annenberg Sch Commun & Journalism, G6,3502 Watts Way, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA; [Yegiyan, Narine S.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Commun, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Lai, Mark H.

These storybooks detailed either male-dominated careers (i.e., STEM: science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) or female-dominated careers (i.e., HEED: health, early education, and domestic roles), and they featured either a male protagonist or a female protagonist. Results indicated that the STEM storybook led mothers to perceive STEM careers as more suitable for their children, and it led girls to express more interest in STEM careers. However, there was some indication that mothers directed more discouraging comments toward their children (e.g., You don't like that) while reading the HEED storybook, especially when it featured a male protagonist. This version also led boys to express less interest in HEED careers. These results suggest that exposure to stories with stereotype-defying characters can benefit girls, yet sometimes backfire among boys. Given the context of the study (i.e., a science museum), it remains possible that these results only apply to children from relatively advantaged backgrounds (i.e., higher family income and education).

The current experience sampling method (ESM) study examined whether adolescents who use more social media than their peers experience more distraction (between-person association), whether social media use (SMU) and distraction co-fluctuate within adolescents (momentary within-person associations), and to what extent this within-person association differs from person to person (person-specific associations). With a sample of 383 adolescents (M-age = 14.11), who together completed 35,099 ESM surveys (73% compliance), we found both a positive between-person association (beta = .31) and a positive momentary within-person association (beta = .12) of SMU with distraction. The momentary within-person association differed from adolescent to adolescent: While SMU and distraction were positively associated among 82.5% of all adolescents, they were not associated among 15.7% of the adolescents, and negatively associated among 1.8% of the adolescents. Additional analyses on the direction of the effect showed that the within-person effect of SMU on subsequent levels of distraction was somewhat stronger (beta = .05) than the effect of distraction on subsequent levels of SMU (beta = .03).","[Siebers, Teun; Beyens, Ine; Pouwels, J.

In order to investigate how these new factors can afford a unique interaction experience, the current study develops a user-driven conceptualization of interactivity in wearable technology. In Study 1, through an interview and a survey with wrist-worn smart device users, four factors that comprise interactivity of wrist-worn smart devices are identified: networking, adaptive, nudging, and multisensory. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses are conducted to examine the four-factor structure of interactivity and demonstrate strong reliability and convergent validity among the proposed factors. Study 2 revalidates the measurement structure of interactivity developed in Study 1 and further tests the theoretical value of the four-factor model by examining how the four factors predict usage intention mediated by hedonic and utilitarian benefits.

In both studies, teens reported co-viewing and mediating their parents' exposure to LGBTQ content (i.e., encouraging positive exposure, discouraging negative exposure, critiquing/explicating depictions) and indicated that such moments sometimes elicited conversations about their own sexual or gender identities. In both studies, their perceptions of their parents' receptivity to these interactions varied widely. In both studies, teens' LGBTQ-media-related behavior and perceptions of parental receptivity were positively associated with perceptions that their parents supported their LGBTQ identity. Perceived receptivity (in Study 1) and perceived support for the teens' LGBTQ identities (in Study 2) were associated with teens' self-esteem and depressive symptoms.

In two experiments and a pilot study, a novel self-probed emotional retrospection task was used to measure emotional shifts. We examined the link between transportation and emotional shifts and the association of these processes with story-consistent attitudes, social sharing intentions, and behavior. We manipulated transportation via positive and negative reviews prior to story exposure. Consistent with theory, and across both experiments, we found that transportation was positively associated with the number and intensity of emotional shifts. Transportation was linked to affective-level attitudes in particular. While emotional shifts were not related to attitudes in Experiment 1, they were related to affective-level attitudes and social sharing intentions in Experiment 2.

Theorists have suggested that this exposure may impact behavior, particularly real-life aggression. Specifically, exposure to prosocial (coping) humor in media entertainment is posited to decrease aggression, whereas the reverse has been argued for exposure to antisocial (disparaging and slapstick) humor. Despite these suppositions, little empirical evidence about this relationship exists. To fill this gap, this study employed a cohort-sequential design using latent growth curve models to estimate the (co-)development of adolescents' preferences for television shows featuring disparaging, slapstick, and coping humor and aggression from age 10 to 17. Results showed that at the onset of adolescence, especially boys had a higher preference for shows with disparaging and slapstick humor than with coping humor. However, over the course of adolescence, boys' and girls' preferences for shows with coping humor increased, while especially girls' preferences for shows with disparaging and slapstick humor decreased. These preferences were unrelated to adolescents' aggression. Our findings provide an important addition to the ongoing media effects debate. Taken together, they offer room for optimism and point toward an increased focus on the potential positive rather than the negative sides of humor in the lives of young people.","[van der Wal, Amber; Pouwels, J.

Perspectives applying communication scripts to human-AI interactions propose that outcomes are determined by messages and the embedded cues therein. The expectancy violations perspective posits that message characteristics are less important than whether they are expected or unexpected. A pilot study established baseline expectancies about humans' and chatbots' conversational contingency and response latencies. A 2 (contingency: more/less contingent responses) x 2 (latency: fast/slow responses) x 2 (communicator identity: human/chatbot) experiment then tested predictions derived from human-human communication scripts and expectancy violations using textual variations in an e-commerce chat. Communicators showing greater conversational contingency and faster responses were most credible, whether they were human or chatbots, but chatbots were consistently less socially attractive than humans. Results show that humans and chatbots are evaluated similarly regarding the functional, but not the relational aspects of communication.

An experiment (N = 286) exposed participants to separate narrative messages to test whether identification with the main character, and strongly holding the value affirmed for the character, influence global self-integrity for audience members. Results demonstrate that such a vicarious self-affirmation experience does lead to greater self-integrity, and that this effect is strongest at high levels of identification with the main character. However, when identification is low, whether or not the value affirmed is one strongly held by the audience member determines whether self-integrity is bolstered.

All three multi-stage routes might lead to greater inspiration. Two pilot studies identify three common content themes that inspire people, such that they demonstrate people's moral virtues, transformation (i.e., overcoming difficulties through perseverance despite adversity), and creativity. The experiment in Study 1 tests the proposed process model using feature stories in news programs that demonstrate moral virtues, transformation, and creativity by exemplars. A second experiment in Study 2 provides a further test by comparing competition shows that involve different levels of creativity (cooking, singing, quizzes).

This paper presents the results of an experiment that manipulates the presence/absence of a victim of an immoral protagonist's actions in an audio-visual narrative. We measure various narrative engagement variables including perspective-taking, approbation of behavior, and character liking. Thus, our study design tests content cues corresponding to Bandura's selective moral disengagement hypotheses and links them to variables specified in Zillmann's affective disposition theory. Findings indicate that perspective-taking with the immoral protagonist is enhanced when the victim is absent. Perspective-taking then has downstream effects on other narrative processing variables, such as character judgments, desires for specific story outcomes, and punitiveness toward similar real-world behaviors. The design of the current study thus provides a roadmap for future research, and we discuss the value of carefully manipulating narrative cues in order to encourage or discourage moral disengagement in viewers.","[Frazer, Rebecca; Moyer-Guse, Emily; Grizzard, Matthew] Ohio State Univ, Sch Commun, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Frazer, R (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Sch Commun, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",frazer.39@osu.edu,"Grizzard, Matthew/Y-3372-2018","Grizzard, Matthew/0000-0003-2883-0308; Frazer, Rebecca/0000-0003-0443-3113",,,,,49,1,1,8,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1521-3269,1532-785X,,MEDIA PSYCHOL,Media Psychol.,44746,2022,25,4,,,,,619,637,,10.1080/15213269.2022.2034020,0,,44593,19,"Communication; Film, Radio, Television; Psychology, Applied",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI),"Communication; Film, Radio & Television; Psychology",2U3QP,,hybrid,,,44885,WOS:000762205700001,0

Results support dynamical privacy calculus assumptions on the within-subject level: situational privacy concerns were negatively, and situationally perceived benefits and knowledge were positively associated with app adoption. Remarkably, a within-person interaction between concerns and benefits was found. Moreover, the trait need for privacy moderated the relation between perceived benefits and app adoption.

Overall, these findings emphasize social media's potential to buffer against the deleterious effect of discrimination on LGB people's mental health.","[Marciano, Avi] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Commun Studies, Beer Sheva, Israel; [Antebi-Gruszka, Nadav] Columbia Univ, Dept Psychol, New York, NY 10027 USA",Ben Gurion University; Columbia University,"Marciano, A (corresponding author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Commun Studies, Beer Sheva, Israel.",avimarci@bgu.ac.il,"Marciano, Avi/AAX-2487-2020","Marciano, Avi/0000-0002-2813-6159",,,,,104,0,0,3,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1521-3269,1532-785X,,MEDIA PSYCHOL,Media Psychol.,44563,2022,25,1,,,,,27,50,,10.1080/15213269.2020.1850295,0,,44136,24,"Communication; Film, Radio, Television; Psychology, Applied",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI),"Communication; Film, Radio & Television; Psychology",YK6KU,,,,,44885,WOS:000594066900001,0

As seemingly ordinary and trustworthy individuals, who can function as opinion leaders, influencers may impact perceptions of the virus and policies in place to minimize its threat. In this pre-registered online experiment (N = 148), we investigated factors such as parasocial relationships with the influencer, which potentially increase susceptibility to influencers' claims. Second, we examined if media literacy and issue-specific knowledge act as protective factors diminishing the impact of misinformation. Although participants remained largely unaffected by the misinformation, it increased mistrust in official sources for respondents with high perceived influencer credibility, trust in influencer's advice, and attitude homophily. Meanwhile, participants' issue-specific knowledge was associated with weaker beliefs in misconceptions regarding COVID-19, irrespective of exposure to misinformation.","[Harff, Darian; Bollen, Charlotte; Schmuck, Desiree] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Sch Mass Commun Res, Parkstr 45,Box 3603, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium",KU Leuven,"Schmuck, D (corresponding author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, Sch Mass Commun Res, Parkstr 45,Box 3603, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.",desiree.schmuck@kuleuven.be,,"Harff, Darian/0000-0002-4354-2198",KU Leuven,KU Leuven(KU Leuven),This work was supported by the KU Leuven [Start-up Grant].,,72,0,0,29,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1521-3269,1532-785X,,MEDIA PSYCHOL,Media Psychol.,44867,2022,25,6,,,,,831,850,,10.1080/15213269.2022.2080711,0,,44713,20,"Communication; Film, Radio, Television; Psychology, Applied",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI),"Communication; Film, Radio & Television; Psychology",5R4FI,,,,,44885,WOS:000807599900001,0

We performed a 2 (verbal intimacy) x 2 (physical intimacy) online experiment among a large representative sample of the Dutch population (N = 2,251). Structural equation modeling confirmed expected relationships between benefits, privacy concerns, communication barriers, trust, and self-disclosure. Generally, when people were more willing to self-disclose, they reported more positive (e.g., relief) and less negative (i.e., stress) emotions. However, when it involved revealing physically intimate information (e.g., showing an intimate vs. non-intimate body part), people were less likely to self-disclose and reported more negative emotions as a result. Our findings suggest that people weigh benefits, costs, and trust in their decision to self-disclose and consider the potential negative intrapersonal effects of intimate self-disclosure.","[Bol, Nadine; Antheunis, Marjolijn L.] Tilburg Univ, Tilburg Ctr Cognit & Commun TICC, Dept Commun & Cognit, Tilburg, Netherlands",Tilburg University,"Bol, N (corresponding author), Tilburg Univ, Warandelaan 2,POB 90153, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands.",Nadine.Bol@uvt.nl,,,,,,,63,0,0,8,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1521-3269,1532-785X,,MEDIA PSYCHOL,Media Psychol.,44807,2022,25,5,,,,,706,723,,10.1080/15213269.2022.2035769,0,,44593,18,"Communication; Film, Radio, Television; Psychology, Applied",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI),"Communication; Film, Radio & Television; Psychology",4A2OR,,hybrid,,,44885,WOS:000753790200001,0

We investigated the age-dependent relationship between VVG consumption and subsequent physically aggressive behavior in a meta-analytic procedure based on longitudinal studies. Further exploratory analyses addressed the moderating effect of the year of data collection. A random-effects meta-analysis with 30 effect sizes from 21 studies (N = 15,836) yielded a significant and relevant positive effect of VVG on subsequent physically aggressive behavior (r = .21). The effect was reduced but maintained at r = .11 when controlling for aggression at T1. Polynomial regression showed a significant U-shaped age trajectory with a peak in early adolescence at the age of 14. Year of data collection did not correlate with the effect size. Consequently, we confirm the results of other meta-analyses, with the added finding of a peak of effect sizes in early adolescence. The empirical finding provide support for basing age ratings for game publication on potential adverse behavioral effects.","[Burkhardt, Johanna; Lenhard, Wolfgang] Julius Maximilians Univ Wurzburg, Inst Psychol, Wittelsbacherpl 1, D-97074 Wurzburg, Germany",University of Wurzburg,"Lenhard, W (corresponding author), Julius Maximilians Univ Wurzburg, Inst Psychol, Wittelsbacherpl 1, D-97074 Wurzburg, Germany.",wolfgang.lenhard@uni-wuerzburg.de,,"Burkhardt, Johanna/0000-0002-1161-7968; Lenhard, Wolfgang/0000-0002-8184-6889",,,,,53,4,4,11,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1521-3269,1532-785X,,MEDIA PSYCHOL,Media Psychol.,44685,2022,25,3,,,,,499,512,,10.1080/15213269.2021.1980729,0,,44440,14,"Communication; Film, Radio, Television; Psychology, Applied",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI),"Communication; Film, Radio & Television; Psychology",0U5AY,,,,,44885,WOS:000697637700001,0

We further ask under what circumstances they work most effectively to curb persuasion by looking at their interaction with cognitive elaboration - that is, thoughtful and systematic processing. We present new evidence from a study conducted on a sample of American citizens (N = 528) and use a quasi-experimental design in which respondents are exposed to a tailored counterargument on a political issue. The results suggest that it is not the use of the isolated resistance strategies but that it is overall effort individuals put into resisting that help them to defend their attitude, and that this effect is reinforced by cognitive elaboration.","[Valli, Chiara] Univ Bern, Inst Commun & Media Studies Icmb, Fabrikstr 8, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Nai, Alessandro] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Commun Res ASCoR, Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Bern; University of Amsterdam,"Valli, C (corresponding author), Univ Bern, Inst Commun & Media Studies Icmb, Fabrikstr 8, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland.",chiara.vallli@unibe.ch,"Nai, Alessandro/L-9058-2019","Nai, Alessandro/0000-0001-7303-2693; Valli, Chiara/0000-0002-7347-0957",,,,,55,0,0,5,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1521-3269,1532-785X,,MEDIA PSYCHOL,Media Psychol.,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1080/15213269.2022.2098774,0,,44743,24,"Communication; Film, Radio, Television; Psychology, Applied",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI),"Communication; Film, Radio & Television; Psychology",3I1TB,,"hybrid, Green Published",,,44885,WOS:000832505800001,0

A large body of literature shows how inaccurate information might lead to misperceptions despite of corrections and retractions. This study highlights individuals' acts of resistance against journalistic reporting as a driver of misperceptions. Based on the framework of resistance strategies, we examine four processes which enable individuals to arrive at political realities that differ from the facts that are reported in the legacy media: 1) avoidance of the evidence; 2) biased evaluation of journalists' expert opinion as a form of biased processing; 3) contesting the content and source of evidence; and 4) bolstering attitudes by seeking out like-minded discussions. We apply this theoretical model to explain misperceptions on the political Ibiza scandal and misperceptions about climate change policies in Austria. Findings from a two-wave panel study in the Austrian election context (N = 523) suggest that misperceptions stem in part from wrong inferences about journalistic expert opinion. Moreover, individuals that engage in source derogation of legacy media are able to uphold their misperceptions in the face of opposing evidence.","[Stubenvoll, Marlis; Matthes, Joerg] Univ Vienna, Dept Commun, Wahringerstr 29, A-1090 Vienna, Austria",University of Vienna,"Stubenvoll, M (corresponding author), Univ Vienna, Dept Commun, Wahringerstr 29, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.",marlis.stubenvoll@univie.ac.at,"Matthes, Jorg/B-5598-2009","Matthes, Jorg/0000-0001-9408-955X; Stubenvoll, Marlis/0000-0003-1870-0403",University of Vienna via the uni:docs fellowship; Austrian Press Agency (APA) via the APA-UNIVIE Data Project,University of Vienna via the uni:docs fellowship; Austrian Press Agency (APA) via the APA-UNIVIE Data Project,This work was supported by the University of Vienna via the uni:docs fellowship and the Austrian Press Agency (APA) via the APA-UNIVIE Data Project;,,46,2,2,2,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1521-3269,1532-785X,,MEDIA PSYCHOL,Media Psychol.,44624,2022,25,2,,,,,318,341,,10.1080/15213269.2021.1951767,0,,44378,24,"Communication; Film, Radio, Television; Psychology, Applied",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI),"Communication; Film, Radio & Television; Psychology",ZQ2CI,,hybrid,,,44885,WOS:000678917500001,0

Two routes are explained by current models: Schema activation, whereby viewers' dispositions are based on perceived narrative role, and behavioral approbation, whereby viewers' dispositions are based on moral approval/disapproval of behavior. What remains unclear is how competing character schemas function: Do they exert their influence in the same location of the serial process? Or, does the impact of schemas on disposition formation depend on the schema? The current paper builds on past work that experimentally manipulated schema activation and behavioral approbation with experimental inductions. We extend that past work by crossing its hero/villain-schema induction with another: character gender. After validating stimuli in a pilot study, our main experiment demonstrated that gender did not moderate hero/villain-schema activation; behavioral approbation, however, was more extreme for female characters. Theoretical implications suggest that various character schemas may have distinct roles to play in disposition formation, with these distinctions being unaccounted for by current theory. Practical implications suggest that female characters may elicit stronger positive/negative dispositions and, through outcome evaluation processes, narrative enjoyment. Thus, Hollywood's current lack of female character representation is likely hurting their bottom line.","[Francemone, C.

Student participants were presented with different PNS profiles that were systematically varied by the level of expertise (high vs. medium vs. low) conveyed through text (i.e., a description of experience and education) and pictures (i.e., a photo of the profile owner vs. a placeholder). Our results revealed a textual primacy in expertise evaluations of PNS profiles, as text expertise was crucial, independent of picture expertise. However, picture expertise was particularly important in cases of high text expertise. Placeholders always resulted in more negative judgments than high-expertise pictures and sometimes even had the same effect as low-expertise pictures.

The faster-paced program was attended to more, while 3-year-olds showed more attention and effort on the problem-solving task after watching the slower program, but there were no significant differences in performance on unrelated or related tasks depending on pace. The lack of differences observed in this naturalistic setting together with the high levels of comprehension of the programs watched provides some evidence to counter the harm perceived in young children watching fast-paced entertainment programs.","[Rose, Sarah E.] Staffordshire Univ, Staffordshire Ctr Psychol Res, Leek Rd, Stoke On Trent ST4 8RU, Staffs, England; [Lamont, Alexandra M.] Keele Univ, Sch Psychol, Newcastle Under Lyme, England; [Reyland, Nicholas] Royal Northern Coll Mus, Manchester, Lancs, England",Staffordshire University; Keele University; Royal Northern College of Music - UK,"Rose, SE (corresponding author), Staffordshire Univ, Staffordshire Ctr Psychol Res, Leek Rd, Stoke On Trent ST4 8RU, Staffs, England.",s.e.rose@staffs.ac.uk,"Lamont, Alexandra/AAU-7469-2021","Lamont, Alexandra/0000-0003-4113-1018",British Academy [SG101562],British Academy,This work was supported by Grant SG101562 from the British Academy.,,68,0,0,4,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1521-3269,1532-785X,,MEDIA PSYCHOL,Media Psychol.,44624,2022,25,2,,,,,208,233,,10.1080/15213269.2021.1901744,0,,44287,26,"Communication; Film, Radio, Television; Psychology, Applied",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI),"Communication; Film, Radio & Television; Psychology",ZQ2CI,,Green Accepted,,,44885,WOS:000638172100001,0

Although previous research has indicated that different character types might have different patterns of moral upholding/violation, a recent study found that character types, including types of MACs, were not perceived to vary on specific moral foundations, but did vary in overall perceived morality across all foundations. To further examine whether distinct character types are perceived to have different patterns of perceived morality, this study replicated that recent study in a sample of US young adults, again finding that character types did not vary according to specific moral domains.

Psychological research finds that personal details can individuate a person, especially when they are perceived as atypical for the social category. We apply this logic to affective disposition theory to determine whether character individuation can influence disposition formation. Two pilot studies validated the typicality and moral irrelevance of six pairs of character details. We then deployed these details in an experiment (N = 822) in which participants viewed a biography of a fictional U.S. Marine character. We manipulated the proportion of atypical character details included in the biography in a continuous fashion. Findings indicate a positive linear relationship between the manipulation and several character perception variables. Adding discriminant validity to the findings, we found a negative relationship between the manipulation and perceived realism. Our experimental design and analyses controlled for objective similarity of the character with the participant and the moral relevance of the character details. Thus, our results suggest character individuation is a unique and previously unidentified route of disposition formation.","[Frazer, Rebecca; Grizzard, Matthew; Francemone, C.

The present experiment adds to this literature by investigating the role of user comments that accompany an online political satire video in particular. Moreover, it advances our knowledge of the effect of comments by investigating firstly how user comments shape viewers' experiences of political satire and, secondly, how these experiences subsequently influence viewers' behavioral intentions. The results show that the valence of comments influences viewers' behavioral intentions and that this effect is mediated by viewers' subjective knowledge gain and their eudaimonic entertainment experiences in response to the political satire video. Although the valence of comments also affects political satire viewers' hedonic entertainment experiences, these specific entertainment experiences do not impact viewers' behavioral intentions. These results show that comments do not only shape viewers' experiences as they are watching political satire online, but they also have consequences for what viewers intent to do offline.","[Moller, A.

Based on two large-scale Web-tracking data sets, we developed indicators for routine activation and execution, tested their reliability and stability, and examined their association with the predictability of six Web use behaviors: overall Web use, news use, shopping, Facebook, YouTube, and Google use. Our results show that routine measures derived from tracking data were only moderately reliable but very stable. Routine activation was consistently and substantially associated with higher predictability for all Web use behaviors, whereas routine execution was less consistently and not strongly linked to predictability.","[Schnauber-Stockmann, Anna; Scharkow, Michael] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Dept Commun, Jakob Welder Weg 12, D-55099 Mainz, Germany; [Breuer, Johannes] GESIS Leibniz Inst Social Sci, Survey Data Curat, Cologne, Germany",Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz; Leibniz Institut fur Sozialwissenschaften (GESIS),"Schnauber-Stockmann, A (corresponding author), Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Dept Commun, Jakob Welder Weg 12, D-55099 Mainz, Germany.",anna.schnauber-stockmann@uni-mainz.de,"Schnauber-Stockmann, Anna/AAQ-2320-2021; Breuer, Johannes/I-9514-2019","Schnauber-Stockmann, Anna/0000-0002-6795-1244; Breuer, Johannes/0000-0001-5906-7873",,,,,50,0,0,3,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1521-3269,1532-785X,,MEDIA PSYCHOL,Media Psychol.,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1080/15213269.2022.2121286,0,,44805,23,"Communication; Film, Radio, Television; Psychology, Applied",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI),"Communication; Film, Radio & Television; Psychology",4I9DZ,,,,,44885,WOS:000850874300001,0

In this article, we present a conceptual framework for studying the communication of values on and through social media composed of two dimensions: scale (from individual users to global infrastructures) and explicitness (from the most explicit to the invisible). Utilizing the model, we compare the communication of two values-engagement and authenticity-in user-generated content and policy documents on Twitter and Instagram. We find a split between how users and platforms frame these concepts and discuss the strategic role of ambiguity in value discourse, where idealistic meanings invoked by users positively charge the instrumental applications stressed by platforms. We also show how implicit and explicit articulations of the same value can contradict each other. Finally, we reflect upon tensions within the model, as well as the power relations between the personal, cultural, and infrastructural levels of platform values.","[Hallinan, Blake; Scharlach, Rebecca; Shifman, Limor] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Commun & Journalism, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel",Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"Hallinan, B (corresponding author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Commun & Journalism, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel.",blake.hallinan@mail.huji.ac.il,,"Shifman, Limor/0000-0002-2616-9491; Hallinan, Blake/0000-0002-4696-8290",European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program [819004],European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program(European Research Council (ERC)),This project has received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program (grant agreement No 819004).,,65,3,3,8,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1050-3293,1468-2885,,COMMUN THEOR,Commun.

Equally, through its focus on how actors' deceptive strategies are important in attempts to exercise power, it can augment the study of the cognitive and attitudinal biases that render people susceptible to misperceptions. We identify the main themes in the study of deception: media-systemic distortions in information supply; the relational interactions that both produce and activate cognitive biases; and the attributes, strategies, and techniques of deceptive entities.

However, by synthesizing Mouffe's model with the ideas of Zygmunt Bauman and Iris Marion Young, I introduce the concept of an empathetic public sphere as a model for creating minimal common grounds between right-wing populist selves and the others they oppose.

Crucial to the intellectual history of media and communication theory, Lazarsfeld invited Adorno not only to develop techniques to inform educational music study, but to strategically formulate advocacy language for the media reform movement to help noncommercial media obtain frequency licenses.

First, solitude has been approached from a number of different research traditions, resulting in disconnected streams of theory. Furthermore, these streams were developed before the rise of the Internet and mobile media. As a result, solitude is commonly, if not most commonly, conceptualized and measured as a matter of being physically alone. This article re-conceptualizes solitude as noncommunication to offer a more contemporary and inclusive perspective, one that uproots it from ideations of physical aloneness and replants it in social aloneness. Whereas previous theory in this area often ignores mediated interaction, we recognize it as a meaningful way for people to connect, with important implications for solitude. Our framework also calls for interrogation of key contextual factors that condition whether and how solitude is experienced in the digital era.","[Campbell, Scott W.] Univ Michigan, Dept Commun & Media, 5438 North Quad 105,South State St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Ross, Morgan Q.] Ohio State Univ, Sch Commun, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Campbell, SW (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Commun & Media, 5438 North Quad 105,South State St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",swcamp@umich.edu,,"Ross, Morgan/0000-0001-7416-9851",,,,,70,3,3,4,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1050-3293,1468-2885,,COMMUN THEOR,Commun.

We present data from an experimental study to illustrate the proposed test procedure and provide evidence for two theoretically derived patterns indicative of misinformation rejection.

While a portion of the existing historiography fits the disciplinary framework, the post-disciplinary thesis raises theoretical, methodological, and empirical challenges. In order to meet those challenges, we argue that historical research should also be directed toward intellectual and institutional projects that predated or transcended the institutionalization of communication as a discipline. To this end, we revisit the contribution of American journalist Franklin Ford (1849-1918) as an entry point into a historical moment when the study of communication was considered intellectually, socially, and institutionally relevant-for reasons that differ from the post-World War II institutionalization of communication as a discipline. Based on archival research, our approach emphasizes how Ford's project diverges from the conventional disciplinary histories.","[Trudel, Dominique] Audencia Business Sch, Commun Culture & Languages Dept, F-44200 Nantes, France; [De Maeyer, Juliette] Dept Commun, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada",Audencia,"Trudel, D (corresponding author), Audencia Business Sch, Commun Culture & Languages Dept, F-44200 Nantes, France.",dtrudel@audencia.com,"Trudel, Dominique/AIB-8500-2022","Trudel, Dominique/0000-0002-6540-006X",Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [430-2018-00809],Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),This work was supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [grant number 430-2018-00809].,,97,0,0,2,3,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1050-3293,1468-2885,,COMMUN THEOR,Commun.

However, current conceptualizations of anthropomorphism in HRI have not adequately distinguished between precursors, consequences, and dimensions of anthropomorphism. Building and elaborating on previous research, we conceptualize anthropomorphism as a form of human cognition, which centers upon the attribution of human mental capacities to a robot. Accordingly, perceptions related to a robot's shape and movement are potential precursors of anthropomorphism, while attributions of personality and moral value to a robot are potential consequences of anthropomorphism. Arguing that multidimensional conceptualizations best reflect the conceptual facets of anthropomorphism, we propose, based on Theory-of-Mind (ToM) framework, that anthropomorphism in HRI consists of attributing thinking, feeling, perceiving, desiring, and choosing to a robot. We conclude by discussing applications of our conceptualization in HRI research.","[Kuhne, Rinaldo; Peter, Jochen] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Commun Res, ASCoR, POB 15791, NL-1001 NG Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam,"Kuhne, R (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Commun Res, ASCoR, POB 15791, NL-1001 NG Amsterdam, Netherlands.",r.j.kuhne@uva.nl,,,European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [682733],European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme(European Research Council (ERC)),"Work on this article was made possible by funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme, under grant agreement no. 682733 to the second author.",,83,0,0,12,12,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1050-3293,1468-2885,,COMMUN THEOR,Commun.

I define strategic illiteracies as: purposeful, committed refusals to learn expected communication and technology skills, not only as individual people in specific moments, but also in communities over time. This concept connects technology refusal to historical lineages of resistance to linguistic and orthographic imperialism, analyzing examples including the Greek alphabet in antiquity, Chinese characters in Asia, and the Latin alphabet through European colonization.

We exemplify the procedure of multiperspectival normative assessment (MNA) using mediated reactions to terrorism as our case in point. We first identify the normative challenges related to the speed and substance of terrorism communication and the ways in which relations of solidarity are communicatively constructed in reacting to terrorism. We link these challenges to four distinct normative theories that prioritize competing values for public discourse (freedom, community values, empowerment of the marginalized or constructive debate). The resulting set of competing normative expectations, which help assess the performance of terrorism communication, are eventually translated into recommendations for professional and non-professional communicators. In conclusion, we show how MNA can help ground empirical scholarship in firmer theoretical foundations while simultaneously demonstrating the usefulness of normative theory in analyzing a wide range of issues.","[Wessler, Hartmut; Chan, Chung-hong] Univ Mannheim, Mannheim Ctr European Social Res MZES, D-68159 Mannheim, Germany; [Althaus, Scott L.] Univ Illinois, Cline Ctr Adv Social Res, Urbana, IL 61870 USA; [Jungblut, Marc] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Media & Commun, D-80538 Munich, Germany; [Welbers, Kasper; van Atteveldt, Wouter] Free Univ Amsterdam, Dept Commun Sci, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Mannheim; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; University of Munich; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Wessler, H (corresponding author), Univ Mannheim, Mannheim Ctr European Social Res MZES, D-68159 Mannheim, Germany.",wessler@uni-mannheim.de,"Welbers, Kasper/D-2785-2016; van Atteveldt, Wouter/L-8685-2013","Welbers, Kasper/0000-0003-2929-3815; Wessler, Hartmut/0000-0003-4216-5471; van Atteveldt, Wouter/0000-0003-1237-538X; Jungblut, Marc/0000-0002-2677-0738",,,,,43,0,0,3,3,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1050-3293,1468-2885,,COMMUN THEOR,Commun.

Second, it increases our understanding of CC processes by elaborating on three mechanisms of CC (group autonomy, group identification, and generative discipline) and how they operate differently in online work/non-work and closed/open contexts. Third, it develops propositions about how these mechanisms interact with three prominent media affordances (visibility, persistence and editability) within those contexts.

While media discourse and framing are used in close connection in academic literature, we examine how the approaches theorize media power and politics differently. Framing theory examines how issues are constructed interactively, represented in mediated form, and interpreted within an institutionalized policy sphere. Some framing studies critically examine structural or hegemonic power. However, the preoccupation with manifest interactions entails a diminished sensibility to systematic exclusion. Discourse theory provides a post-foundational conceptualization of politics as the political in which media discourses are antagonistic, contingent, and open to change. Discourse theory expands media power to include (subversive) positions beyond hegemonic politics. We argue that applying either discourse or framing theory in media studies has theoretical and analytical consequences and that theoretical sensitivity will strengthen the discriminatory power of framing and discourse theory as two distinct fields.","[Roslyng, Mette Marie; Dindler, Camilla] Aalborg Univ, AC Meyers Vaenge 15, DK-2450 Copenhagen SV, Denmark",Aalborg University,"Roslyng, MM (corresponding author), Aalborg Univ, Dept Commun & Psychol, AC Meyers Vaenge 15, DK-2450 Copenhagen SV, Denmark.",mmroslyng@ikp.aau.dk,,"Dindler, Camilla/0000-0002-5494-474X; Roslyng, Mette Marie/0000-0001-9480-6969",,,,,85,0,0,17,17,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1050-3293,1468-2885,,COMMUN THEOR,Commun.

Early work in this field attempted to identify a universal norm from which the specific, applied norms of media professions and practices could be derived. However, postcolonial and pluralist critiques have revealed potential problems with this approach. To avoid such problems, neo-Aristotelian critiques have proposed focusing less on defining universal norms of obligated action and more on acknowledging local variations in conceptions of the good life. These critiques rightly stress the goal of understanding the diversity of ethical values both within and across cultures. However, when the goal of media ethics is to provide guidance for cooperative resolutions of value conflicts, the generalizability of norms remains an important issue.

The results illustrate the inequality, sexual harassment, lack of legitimacy, and stereotypes faced by these women, and their strong emotional leadership. Their stories of success show how academia is a field of struggle where hegemony, domination, and resistance coexist. However, female experiences in academia are diverse and complex.

We suggest one way to satisfy this need is to extend and adapt extant theories of offline relational maintenance to mediated interactions by addressing how CMC is likely integrated to sustain the underlying processes of human interaction in newer channels. Social penetration theory (SPT) is used to illustrate the process proposed. The building blocks of SPT-self-disclosure, reciprocal exchange, and the effect of environmental and situational contexts on interpersonal interactions-are still considered vital in sustaining relationships, even online. By considering how these components are affected by the idiosyncrasies of computer mediation, this work provides a path toward consistent, theoretically-driven research regarding the maintenance of relationships via CMC, and also exemplifies how scholars may forge additional avenues for such research.","[Mason, Adam J.] Michigan State Univ, Commun, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Carr, Caleb T.] Illinois State Univ, Sch Commun, Normal, IL 61790 USA",Michigan State University; Illinois State University,"Mason, AJ (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Commun, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",the.adam.j@gmail.com,,"Mason, Adam/0000-0002-0703-5121; Carr, Caleb/0000-0002-5700-6636",,,,,84,3,3,3,12,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1050-3293,1468-2885,,COMMUN THEOR,Commun.

We propose that these expectations can be considered as communication norms, which enable cooperative communication in political debates and conflicts. We use action theory, evolutionary anthropology, and linguistics to propose a norm concept that differentiates five communication norms: an information norm, a modality norm, a process norm, a relation norm, and a context norm. Drawing on these norms, we propose new definitions of incivility and civility.

Often such studies are rather one-sided because they disregard questions of continuity, which can lead to inadequate analyses and exaggerated claims of change. Three categories of reasons for this bias towards change are identified through a literature review. Crucially, since continuity remains an undervalued concern, we lack sophisticated theorizations and analytical approaches to study it adequately. In response, this article presents a taxonomy of continuity based on a thematic analysis of 74 articles in leading communication journals. The five observed dimensions of continuity offer scholars the vocabulary and a conceptual framework to study continuity more systematically as a complex and multi-dimensional issue. This contribution serves as a starting point towards building a theory of change and continuity, and suggestions for necessary future work are given.","[Driessens, Olivier] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Commun, DK-2300 Copenhagen S, Denmark",University of Copenhagen,"Driessens, O (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Dept Commun, DK-2300 Copenhagen S, Denmark.",Olivier@hum.ac.uk,,"Driessens, Olivier/0000-0003-0933-419X",,,,,86,0,0,3,3,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1050-3293,1468-2885,,COMMUN THEOR,Commun.

These similar, and thus shared audience responses constitute the recruitment of sensory, perceptual, and higher-level neurocognitive processes, which occur separately in the brain of each individual, but in a collectively shared fashion across the audience. A method called inter-subject-correlation (ISC) analysis allows to reveal these shared responses. This manuscript introduces a theoretical model of brain function that explains why shared brain responses occur and how they emerge along a gradient from sensation to cognition as individuals process the same message content. This model makes results from ISC-based studies more interpretable from a communication perspective, helps organize the results from existing studies across different subfields, and generates testable predictions. The article discusses how research at the nexus of media, audience research, and neuroscience contributes to and advances communication theory.","[Schmalzle, Ralf] Michigan State Univ, Dept Commun, 404 Wilson Rd, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Michigan State University,"Schmalzle, R (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Commun, 404 Wilson Rd, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",schmaelz@msu.edu,,,,,,,67,0,0,2,3,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1050-3293,1468-2885,,COMMUN THEOR,Commun.

The terrain in which academia and media meet, consequently, is ripe for exploration into the fate of intellect when transgressive. This article explicates four features of the academic-media nexus that contribute to social control of intellect: instrumental rationalism of faculty, strategic management of university communication, journalistic appropriation of the public intellectual role, and surveillance of academic discourse. The article situates the features in a framework to recognize whether they originate primarily in academia or media, and whether the controlling process occurs through internalized norms or calculated practice. While social control is understood as recursive and reinforcing, reflexivity induced in an inter-field dynamic implies the possibility of reconciling intellect with news work.","[McDevitt, Michael] Univ Colorado, Media Commun & Informat, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"McDevitt, M (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Media Commun & Informat, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",mike.mcdevitt@colorado.edu,,,,,,,89,1,1,4,10,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1050-3293,1468-2885,,COMMUN THEOR,Commun.

Still, several mathematical models have been proposed regarding the persuasive effects of message discrepancy, the difference between a message's advocated position and a message recipient's initial position. With numerical simulations, we analyzed four formal models to identify their strengths and weaknesses. Based on analyses of previous models, we proposed a modified psychological discounting model by solving a differential equation regarding the rate of change of the probability of message acceptance with respect to psychological discrepancy. Whereas previous models predicted nonmonotonic relationships between message discrepancy and belief change, the new model predicts that as message discrepancy increases, belief change monotonically increases unless facilitating factors change due to extremely discrepant messages. We discuss differences between the previous models and the new model, and their significance and implications for theories of persuasion as well as the limitations of the new model.","[Chung, Sungeun] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Media & Commun, Seoul 03063, South Korea; [Fink, Edward L.] Temple Univ, Dept Commun & Social Influence, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA",Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU); Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University,"Chung, S (corresponding author), Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Media & Commun, Seoul 03063, South Korea.",chseun@skku.edu,,"Fink, Edward L./0000-0001-6387-5574",Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea; National Research Foundation of Korea [2021S1A5A2A01065446],"Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea)",This work was supported by the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea and the National Research Foundation of Korea (2021S1A5A2A01065446).,,70,0,0,2,2,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1050-3293,1468-2885,,COMMUN THEOR,Commun.

We thus consider the success of populism as neither inherently driven by political leaders nor primarily driven by increasing populist attitudes in the public and acknowledge the fragmented nature of the populist discourse emphasized by recent studies. We raise the question of whether there is a populist collective identity, which is accountable in terms of populist rhetorical elements, and how it changes over time. To answer this question, we apply the proposed framework to the case of the rise and development of the populist discourse in Switzerland while accounting for its dynamic adaptation to raising public concerns and for the influence of its core rhetorical elements on individual voting behavior.","[Reveilhac, Maud; Morselli, Davide] Lausanne Univ, Life Course & Social Inequal Res Ctr, Inst Social Sci, Fac Social & Polit Sci, CH-1015 Lausanne, VD, Switzerland; [Morselli, Davide] Lausanne Univ, Swiss Ctr Expertise Life Course Res LIVES, CH-1015 Lausanne, VD, Switzerland",University of Lausanne; University of Lausanne,"Reveilhac, M (corresponding author), Lausanne Univ, Life Course & Social Inequal Res Ctr, Inst Social Sci, Fac Social & Polit Sci, CH-1015 Lausanne, VD, Switzerland.",maud.reveilhac@unil.ch,,,,,,,69,1,1,0,4,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1050-3293,1468-2885,,COMMUN THEOR,Commun.

Results showed that for actors, constructive integration had positive associations and destructive integration had negative associations with relational outcomes.

This study uses focus groups and individual interviews, conducted in the propaganda-saturated environment of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, to investigate how audiences develop and negotiate practices for assigning trust to the mediated and social sources. It identifies three verification practices, each based on a different notion of pragmatic trust: Reliance on ideologically close sources; skepticism toward individual sources while trusting media as institution; or institutional distrust and cynical disillusionment. Each practice is embedded in participants' social environment, which both supplies information and helps negotiating appropriate verification practices. The article concludes by discussing implications for studies of media trust and socially shaped understanding of the media.","[Pasitselska, Olga] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Commun & Journalism, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel",Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"Pasitselska, O (corresponding author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Commun & Journalism, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel.",olga.pasitselska@mail.huji.ac.il,,"Pasitselska, Olga/0000-0003-1306-2318",,,,,61,2,2,14,21,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0360-3989,1468-2958,,HUM COMMUN RES,Hum.

In this study, we explore how the involvement of AICTs in communication activities shapes how principals engage in impression management and how their communication partners form impressions of them. Through an inductive, comparative field study of users of two AI scheduling technologies, we uncover three communicative practices through which principals engaged in impression management when AICTs communicate on their behalf: interpretation, diplomacy, and staging politeness. We also uncover three processes through which communication partners formed impressions of principals when communicating with them via AICTs: confirmation, transference, and compartmentalization. We show that communication partners can transfer impressions of AICTs to principals themselves and outline the conditions under which such transference is and is not likely. We discuss the implications of these findings for the study of technological mediation of impression management and formation in the age of artificial intelligence and present propositions to guide future empirical research.","[Endacott, Camille G.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Commun Studies, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA; [Leonardi, Paul M.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Technol Management Program, Phelps Hall, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Charlotte; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara,"Endacott, CG (corresponding author), Univ N Carolina, Dept Commun Studies, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA.",camille.endacott@uncc.edu; leonardi@tmp.ucsb.edu,,"Endacott, Camille/0000-0002-4938-0919",National Science Foundation (Science of Organizations division) [1922266],National Science Foundation (Science of Organizations division)(National Science Foundation (NSF)),Our funding is a grant from the National Science Foundation (Science of Organizations division).

At the same time, scholars have documented the problem of information 'snacking' and information quality on these platforms. These parallel trends in the literature challenge long-held assumptions about the pro-social effects of news consumption and political participation. We argue that reliance on social media for news does not contribute to people's real level of political knowledge (objective knowledge), but instead only influences people's impression of being informed (subjective knowledge). Subjective knowledge is just as important for driving political participation, a potentially troubling trend given the nature of news consumption on social media. We test this expectation with panel survey data from the 2018 U.S. midterm elections. Two path model specifications (fixed effects and autoregressive) support our theoretical model. Implications for the study of the 'dark side' of social media and democracy are discussed.","[Lee, Sangwon] New Mexico State Univ, Dept Commun Studies, 1405 Int Dr, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA; [Diehl, Trevor] Cent Michigan Univ, Sch Broadcast & Cinemat Arts, Moore Hall 313, Mt Pleasant, MI 48859 USA; [Valenzuela, Sebastian] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Commun, Santiago, Region Metropol, Chile",New Mexico State University; Central Michigan University; Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile,"Lee, S (corresponding author), New Mexico State Univ, Dept Commun Studies, 1405 Int Dr, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA.",swlee@nmsu.edu,"Valenzuela, Sebastián/AAA-7308-2020","Valenzuela, Sebastián/0000-0001-5991-7364",,,,,75,9,9,7,17,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0360-3989,1468-2958,,HUM COMMUN RES,Hum.

Findings showed that transcendent narratives of loss increased transportation, identification, and story appreciation especially for individuals with severe grief. Conversely, transcendent narratives of loss increased elevation, and connectedness especially for individuals with low grief. Findings suggest that transcendent narratives of loss resonate with severe personal grief.

To illustrate this analytical approach and how it can contribute to qualitative theorization in general, the article conducts an in-depth ethnographic and comparative examination of civic software production meetings in Israel and the United States.

We review theoretical perspectives useful for studying AI-based persuasion-the Computers Are Social Actors (CASA) paradigm, the Modality, Agency, Interactivity, and Navigability (MAIN) model, and the heuristic-systematic model of persuasion-to explicate how differences in AI complicate persuasion in two ways. First, thin AI exhibits few (if any) machinic (i.e., AI) cues, social cues might be available, and communication is limited and indirect. Second, thick AI exhibits ample machinic and social cues, AI presence is obvious, and communication is direct and interactive.

In its current form, the theory is not set up to account for the mobility of particular communication practices across cultural boundaries. Relying on CDT's conception of communication practices as discursive resources for social interaction, we extend the theory's explanatory power by investigating how speakers constitute the value and movements of a particular resource: the speech genre of public speaking. We performed a cultural discourse analysis (CuDA) of public speaking's circulation between the United States and China to show that value ascriptions constituted divergent cultural discourses of circulation together with key symbols (such as localization and suzhi) and explicit metacultural commentary. These cultural discourses have an accelerative function on the dissemination side of circulation, and an integrative function on the replication side. Thus, cultural discourses of circulation communicatively constitute the mobility of particular discursive resources.","[Boromisza-Habashi, David] Univ Colorado, Dept Commun, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Fang, Yaqiong] Yunnan Univ, Dept Coll English, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; Yunnan University,"Boromisza-Habashi, D (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Dept Commun, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",dbh@colorado.edu,,,,,,,67,0,0,0,0,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0360-3989,1468-2958,,HUM COMMUN RES,Hum.

We use large-scale user logs data on social media platforms (i.e., Facebook and Twitter) and news text data from more than 100 news organizations over 10 months to examine the three potential processes. Our results show that the similarity between news organizations in terms of media ideology and news truthfulness is positively associated with semantic similarity, whereas the public engagement that news articles received on social media is negatively associated with semantic similarity. Our study contributes to theory development in mass communication by shifting to a network paradigm that connects news organizations, news content, and news audiences. We demonstrate how scholars across communication disciplines may collaborate to integrate distinct theories, connect multiple levels, and link otherwise separate dimensions. Methodologically, we demonstrate how synchronizing network science with natural language processing and combining social media log data with text data can help to answer research questions that communication scholars are interested in. The findings' implications for news polarization are discussed.","[Li, Yue; Bond, Robert M.] Ohio State Univ, Sch Commun, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Bond, RM (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Sch Commun, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",bond.136@osu.edu,"Bond, Robert Meade/A-1561-2014",,,,,,45,0,0,9,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0360-3989,1468-2958,,HUM COMMUN RES,Hum.

This essay focuses on algorithms and organizing by reviewing the literature on algorithms in organizations, examining the viewpoint of relationality and relational agency on algorithms and organizing, exploring the properties of algorithms, and concluding what these mean from an organizational communication viewpoint. Algorithms need data to be collected. The data are always biased, and algorithms exclude everything that is not in their code. They define what is seen as important. Their operating principles are opaque, and they are political due to human interference. Algorithms are not just used. Rather, they are co-actors in organizing. We argue that algorithms demand rethinking communication in the communicative constitution of organizations and call for more empirical research emphasizing the properties of algorithms, the relationality of algorithms, and the temporality of the materialization of algorithms.","[Laapotti, Tomi; Raappana, Mitra] Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Language & Commun Studies, Jyvaskyla, Finland",University of Jyvaskyla,"Laapotti, T (corresponding author), Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Language & Commun Studies, Jyvaskyla, Finland.",tomi.laapotti@jyu.fi,,"Laapotti, Tomi/0000-0003-1558-7118",,,,,75,1,1,11,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0360-3989,1468-2958,,HUM COMMUN RES,Hum.

However, two important questions remain unanswered: (a) Do some types of political discussions facilitate greater levels of political knowledge than others? (b) Do people retain knowledge gained from political discussions? In this study (N = 96), we addressed these questions using a novel methodological approach that combines a lab experiment, in which we manipulated the occurrence of political discussion, with a systematic content analysis of participants' discussions (N = 1,080 distinct instances of discussions). We found that discussions involving confirmatory feedback and cueing were associated with greater levels of political knowledge than other types of discussions. Furthermore, knowledge gains from discussion were not retained after a short delay.

The hypotheses are tested using latent change structural equation modeling drawing on two-wave survey data from 437 employees of a global industrial logistics company headquartered in a Nordic country. The findings highlight that visibility is associated with increases in TASW, but not in subjective stress, while persistence is associated with decreases in TASW and subjective stress.

Our findings show that engaging with oppositional views is actually a core practice among Stromfront users which invites active participation and encourages engagement.

The effect was stronger when the incivility was communicated through video versus other media, and for studies conducted in the United States versus Europe.

The current research shows that a key factor in CoO-based evaluations of products is the image of respective national leaders. In two experimental studies, conducted in the United States, we found that exposure to a news article that positively (vs. negatively) characterizes a foreign leader led to more positive perceptions of that leader's country; more positive evaluations of products and brands manufactured there; and thereby also to greater willingness to purchase these products. The results amply demonstrate that the news coverage of modern leaders can significantly affect their national trade, and that therefore the responsibility they carry may extend beyond their official role as political figures.","[Balmas, Meital; Atia, Renana] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Commun, Jerusalem, Israel",Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"Balmas, M (corresponding author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Commun, Jerusalem, Israel.",meitalbalmas@gmail.com,"Atia, Renana/GVT-4812-2022","Atia, Renana/0000-0003-1873-315X; Balmas, Meital/0000-0001-9191-0488",Joseph H. and Belle R.

In contrast, for a sustainable brand, consumers show favorable evaluations when a competence (warmth) appeal is combined with a high (low) construal level. Further, these match-up effects are mediated by two distinct mechanisms: brand admiration (a high construal level) and processing fluency (a low construal level).

Using clickstream data from a multinational retailer, we find that device modality drives purchase frequency, likely due to the differential ease of use of PCs, tablets, and smartphones. In particular, frequency of completed orders is highest when information search and purchase completion are highly convenient, such as when shopping via tablet. We also determine that information search in the form of reading online product reviews has no effect on mobile platforms, while it does on other platforms. These findings contribute to information search theory, suggesting that information search increases purchase likelihood when it is goal directed, extensive, and easy to conduct. Thus, the broad role of digital advertising should be to make the information search process easier and more convenient for consumers to stimulate purchases. These findings help digital advertisers understand information search patterns across device modalities.

Metaphors like Carvana's vending machines and taglines like Red Bull gives you wings have increasingly become a powerful way for marketers to communicate brand attributes. In this study, we sought to characterize the memorability of ads across three distinct categories (functional, emotional, and metaphorical) using behavioral and neuroimaging methods. Participants were exposed to 20 ads from each of these categories and underwent a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan while trying to recall details from these ads one week later. We found a significant effect of category on brand recall immediately after exposure and memory recognition for snippets from the ad a week later, with metaphorical and emotional ads outperforming functional ads. Insights from activation in key memory regions like the bilateral hippocampus during retrieval revealed that while people were likely to remember the salient aspects of emotional ads and rate them as highly vivid, they were weaker in recalling additional central details about the brands featured in them relative to metaphorical ads. These findings demonstrate the superiority of metaphorical ads for integrating contents of the ads and the creation of sticky brand impressions.","[Beard, Elizabeth; Henninger, Nicole M.; Venkatraman, Vinod] Temple Univ, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University,"Beard, E (corresponding author), Temple Univ, Coll Liberal Arts, Dept Psychol, 1810 Liacouras Walk,4th Floor,Room 451, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA.",liz.beard@temple.edu,,"Beard, Elizabeth/0000-0002-1085-1277",United States Postal Service Office of Inspector General [6HQOIG-17-B-0085],United States Postal Service Office of Inspector General,The authors are grateful for funding support from the United States Postal Service Office of Inspector General (6HQOIG-17-B-0085).,,74,0,0,25,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0091-3367,1557-7805,,J ADVERTISING,J.

Therefore, this article aims to provide an in-depth analysis of the academic literature (N = 92) on advertising and preschool children published between 1980 and 2021 and so propose a future research agenda. The analysis revealed that little attention has been paid to preschool children's exposure to and impact from embedded advertising formats (e.g., YouTube advertising). The main interest in the included studies was on preschool children's nutrition, which was reflected in both the constructs studied (e.g., food preferences) and the publication outlets (e.g., Appetite). Further, studies focusing on behavioral outcomes, such as purchase requests, are limited, and therefore little is known about the long-term impact of advertising exposure in preschool children. Finally, most studies do not explicitly disclose a theoretical framework.

By looking into social media influencer-follower relations, this study suggests that the long-held conventional concept of parasocial relation no longer fully encompasses the evolving contemporary human interactions and related relations. The current analysis recommends an updated notion and theorization-a trans-parasocial relation-to capture a collectively reciprocal, (a)synchronously interactive, and co-created relation between influencers and their captive followers. This trans-parasocial relation concept offers a foundation on which new communicative and advertising theories can be developed to explicate new forms of social interactions and consumer behavior. More importantly, in view of this trans-parasocial relation, assumptions of the existing persuasion theory-that is, the persuasion knowledge model-need to be reassessed. The current findings demonstrate that persuasion knowledge does not always negatively affect advertising outcomes. Instead, followers indicate mostly benign attitudes toward influencer-sponsored posts, interpret influencers' sponsorship disclosures as genuine and transparent, and internalize disclosure actions as inspiring and admirable. This study further identifies and elucidates several psychological mechanisms that account for followers' overall appreciation of influencer-sponsored posts: positive bias, verification by cross-validation, and inspirational internalization.","[Lou, Chen] Nanyang Technol Univ, Integrated Mkt Commun, Wee Kim Wee Sch Commun & Informat, Singapore, Singapore",Nanyang Technological University & National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore; Nanyang Technological University,"Lou, C (corresponding author), Nanyang Technol Univ, Wee Kim Wee Sch Commun & Informat, 31 Nanyang Link,03-13, Singapore 637718, Singapore.",chenlou@ntu.edu.sg,,,"Ministry of Education, Singapore [M4012201.060]","Ministry of Education, Singapore(Ministry of Education, Singapore)","This study was supported by a Tier 1 grant from the Ministry of Education, Singapore (grant number M4012201.060).",,74,30,30,23,95,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0091-3367,1557-7805,,J ADVERTISING,J.

The results indicate that male consumers' responses toward sexual appeals are more negative when the advertised products are access based (versus ownership based). For female consumers, sexual appeals lead to equally negative responses in the two consumption modes (Study 1). Male consumers react more negatively to sexual appeals (versus nonsexual appeals) when the advertised product is access based because of a heightened desire for possessiveness, which conflicts with the nonpossessive nature of access-based consumption (Study 2). Notably, the negative effect induced by sexual appeals in access-based consumption mode is supported regardless of whether the degree of match between advertised product and sexual appeals is high or low (Study 3). Moreover, sexually conservative consumers respond to sexual appeals more negatively when the advertised products are access based (versus ownership based) (Study 4). These findings have important implications for advertising activities in the context of access-based consumption and the sharing economy.","[Liang, Yongheng; Su, Yi; Jin, Liyin] Fudan Univ, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Wu, Xiaoyue] East China Univ Sci & Technol, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Fudan University; East China University of Science & Technology,"Su, Y (corresponding author), Fudan Univ, Sch Management, Dept Mkt, 670 Guoshun Rd, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.",suy20@fudan.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [72102069, 72125005]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This research was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (72102069, 72125005).",,80,0,0,12,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0091-3367,1557-7805,,J ADVERTISING,J.

However, digitally enabled transactions continue to transform how services are conceptualized, produced, and delivered around the world. These changes blur the lines between goods and services by creating new combinations of products that call into question fundamental generalizations of the traditional services advertising paradigm. To redress this flaw and regenerate interest in an underexploited research domain, this article (1) introduces a literature-based generalized framework for services advertising and (2) provides a future research agenda for reengaging academicians and practitioners. Although the theoretical basis for services advertising received attention soon after the concept of services marketing was born, it peaked between 1996 and 2005, before waning over the past 15 years. The diminution of empirical attention to this important topic was due, in part, to an overreliance on the traditional goods/services distinction, the lack of an agreed-upon definition, and the theory-practice gap in service-based marketing. Resurrection of this critically needed research will allow new advertising strategies to be developed that will enhance both theory testing and practitioner needs.","[Gilbert, Jonathan Ross] No Arizona Univ, Mkt, WA Franke Coll Business, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Stafford, Marla Royne] Univ Nevada, Lee Business Sch, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA",Northern Arizona University; Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Las Vegas,"Stafford, MR (corresponding author), Univ Nevada, Lee Business Sch, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA.",marla.stafford@unlv.edu,,"Gilbert, Jonathan Ross/0000-0002-9408-5775; Royne Stafford, Marla/0000-0001-5978-9331",,,,,112,2,2,2,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0091-3367,1557-7805,,J ADVERTISING,J.

In part because of this lack of focus, no universally accepted definition of BA has evolved, and there is a need for greater theoretical development of the concept. In response, this article draws on prior work incorporating current developments in the advertising field to derive the following updated definition of BA: Brand awareness is the likelihood that a person retrieves a brand identifier and a product category or category need from memory across brand-relevant situations. In addition, the article summarizes the trajectory of the use of dependent measures of advertising effectiveness and calls for greater focus on the measurement of BA in its various forms. To this end, the article provides guidelines for measuring BA and specific recommendations to future researchers for including BA in studies of advertising effectiveness.","[Bergkvist, Lars] Univ Stavanger, Sch Hotel Management, Mkt, Stavanger, Norway; [Taylor, Charles R.] Villanova Univ, Mkt, Sch Business, Villanova, PA 19085 USA",Universitetet i Stavanger; Villanova University,"Taylor, CR (corresponding author), Villanova Univ, Villanova Sch Business, Villanova, PA 19085 USA.",raymond.taylor@villanova.edu,"Bergkvist, Lars/C-4163-2008","Bergkvist, Lars/0000-0002-4271-9182",,,,,52,5,5,9,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0091-3367,1557-7805,,J ADVERTISING,J.

To persuade effectively these ads must meaningfully link the story with the product. A disconnect between story and product has a negative effect on persuasion. The link between product and story is essential because it helps viewers comprehend meaning, which is embedded in the story. In story ads subjective comprehension of meaning is necessary for an unhindered immersion in the story ad, which in turn drives persuasion. Thus, we extend the transportation-imagery model in a narrative ad context. We outline a taxonomy of types of product-story link and, based on it, create an index to make the link measurable and test the hypotheses. Study 1 empirically validates the index and Study 2 applies the index to test the model empirically. Study 3 employs an experimental design that manipulates strength of product-story link while keeping the ad's story structure stable. We find evidence that the positive effect of product-story link on brand attitude is mediated by subjective comprehension and narrative transportation. This finding indicates the importance of linking the story with the product to obtain maximum impact and discourages the advertising practice of loose links. Further theoretical and managerial implications are discussed.","[Glaser, Matthias; Reisinger, Heribert] Univ Vienna, Vienna, Austria; [Glaser, Matthias; Reisinger, Heribert] Univ Vienna, Dept Mkt & Int Business, Vienna, Austria",University of Vienna; University of Vienna,"Glaser, M (corresponding author), Univ Vienna, Fac Business Econ & Stat, Dept Mkt & Int Business, Oskar Morgenstern Pl 1, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.",matthias.glaser@univie.ac.at,,"Glaser, Matthias/0000-0002-0980-0683","University of Vienna; Austrian Ministry of Education, Science, and Research","University of Vienna; Austrian Ministry of Education, Science, and Research","The data collection was supported by the University of Vienna with a doctoral grant (financed by the Austrian Ministry of Education, Science, and Research).",,84,4,4,30,64,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0091-3367,1557-7805,,J ADVERTISING,J.

These developments have made data collection and consequently dataveillance-the automated, continuous, and sometimes unspecific collection, storage, and processing of digital traces-central concepts for advertising scholarship and practice. Studying the impact of consumers' perceptions of dataveillance is important as perceptions about data collection practices have been shown to diminish the effects of data-driven advertising. This article advances advertising theory by conceptualizing the impact of consumers' perceptions of dataveillance in digital data-driven advertising and applying long-standing advertising research theories to this new phenomenon to provide an overarching framework for future research. The current work presents the dataveillance effects in advertising landscape (DEAL) framework, with specific research directions for future research. This framework has practical implications as it shows how false or accurate beliefs about dataveillance impact consumer responses to digital data-driven advertising. Advertisers may adapt to ensure that digital data-driven advertising does not result in backlash or raise ethical questions. Finally, the framework has implications for privacy regulations, as consumer understanding of data collection is a core issue in current regulatory approaches to dataveillance.","[Strycharz, Joanna] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Commun Res, Nieuwe Achtergracht 166, NL-1018 WV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Segijn, Claire M.] Univ Minnesota, Hubbard Sch Journalism & Mass Commun, St Paul, MN USA",University of Amsterdam; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Strycharz, J (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Commun Res, Nieuwe Achtergracht 166, NL-1018 WV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",j.strycharz@uva.nl,"; Strycharz, Joanna/U-2387-2017","Segijn, Claire/0000-0002-2424-5737; Strycharz, Joanna/0000-0001-7739-3349",,,,,101,1,1,6,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0091-3367,1557-7805,,J ADVERTISING,J.

The incubation phase involves taking a break from thinking about the creative problem, usually by performing a distraction task. However, no studies test the influence of incubation phases in advertising tasks. In-depth interviews among 12 advertising creatives emphasize the practical relevance of this topic but also reveal a lack of knowledge regarding how to design effective breaks. Creating advertisements differs notably from tasks typically investigated in psychology (e.g., Unusual Uses Task). Whereas advertising idea generation requires a complex process of configuring individual elements into a coherent story, the latter requires selecting solutions from a pool of possible options. This research tests this new classification (configuration versus selection) and its implications. In two experiments, participants who engage in an incubation task that occupies brain areas similar to those used in the creative tasks do not exhibit enhanced creative performance compared with no incubation. However, those who engage in an incubation task that involves brain areas different from the creative task perform better. These outcomes reflect task-specific neural fatigue, suggesting that to gain the benefits of incubation phases, advertising creatives must engage specifically in break activities that are dissimilar from the creative task.","[Schuetmaat, Sarah; Kopka, Julian Felix; Langner, Tobias] Berg Univ Wuppertal, Schumpeter Sch Business & Econ, Gaussstr 20, D-42097 Wuppertal, Germany; [Ang, Lawrence] Macquarie Univ, Macquarie Grad Sch Management, Mkt, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of Wuppertal; Macquarie University,"Langner, T (corresponding author), Berg Univ Wuppertal, Schumpeter Sch Business & Econ, Gaussstr 20, D-42097 Wuppertal, Germany.",langner@wiwi.uni-wuppertal.de,,,,,,,80,0,0,4,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0091-3367,1557-7805,,J ADVERTISING,J.

While researchers have explored how narrative transportation can be generated through many different mediums, little research has investigated how narrative transportation can be achieved through a single image, such as those used for print ads and billboards. This research examines how single-image, picture-based ads with high levels of depicted movement can prompt consumers to empathize with characters in the ad, activate their imagination, and experience narrative transportation leading to more positive attitudes toward that ad. In addition, when ads incorporate a design tactic that requires inductive inference, such as showing products as humanized, narrative transportation can be generated even in the absence of depicted movement. This research adds to the narrative transportation literature by providing depicted movement and humanization as specific tactics advertisers can use in a single image to persuade through narrative transportation.","[Grigsby, Jamie L.] Missouri State Univ, Coll Business, Mkt, Springfield, MO 65897 USA; [Jewell, Robert D.] Kent State Univ, Ambassador Crawford Coll Business Adm & Entrepren, Mkt, Kent, OH 44242 USA; [Zamudio, Cesar] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Sch Business Adm, Mkt, Richmond, VA USA",Missouri State University; University System of Ohio; Kent State University; Kent State University Kent; Kent State University Salem; Virginia Commonwealth University,"Grigsby, JL (corresponding author), Missouri State Univ, Coll Business, 901 South Natl Ave, Springfield, MO 65897 USA.",jgrigsby@missouristate.edu,"Zamudio, Cesar/GRX-5530-2022","Grigsby, Jamie L./0000-0003-0570-1837",Kent State University,Kent State University,Partial funding to support this research was provided by Kent State University.,,83,0,0,25,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0091-3367,1557-7805,,J ADVERTISING,J.

In celebration of JA's 50th anniversary, this article presents an in-depth retrospective of the journal and compares it with the other leading advertising journals, such as Journal of Advertising Research (JAR), International Journal of Advertising (IJA), and Journal of Current Issues and Research in Advertising (JCIRA). To do so, this article conducts a bibliometric review using performance analysis and natural language processing (NLP) as a means for co-word analysis on bibliometric information retrieved from Scopus. Using performance analysis, this article demonstrates that JA is the leading advertising journal in terms of research influence (h-index) and impact (g-index), as the journal receives the highest average and total citations despite publishing 11% less than its closest peers (JAR and IJA). Using NLP as a means for co-word analysis, this article reveals eight clusters or themes (1972-2020) that avail in JA's body of knowledge (i.e., advertising appeals, advertising involvement, advertising credibility, advertising brands, advertising impact, advertising modeling and strategies, advertising communication and engagement, and advertising response) as well as nine clusters or themes (2000-2020) that reflect the four leading advertising journals' collective contributions to the body of advertising knowledge (i.e., community advertising, responsible advertising, digital and social media advertising, product placement advertising, advertising impact, advertising credibility and persuasiveness, gamification and signaling in advertising, sponsorship advertising, and attitudes toward advertising). The article concludes with key takeaways and suggestions for prospective authors interested to publish in JA.","[Donthu, Naveen] Georgia State Univ, Dept Mkt, POB 3991, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Lim, Weng Marc; Kumar, Satish] Swinburne Univ Technol, Sarawak, Malaysia; [Kumar, Satish; Pattnaik, Debidutta] Malaviya Natl Inst Technol, Jaipur, Rajasthan, India; [Lim, Weng Marc] Swinburne Univ Technol, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Pattnaik, Debidutta] Woxsen Univ, Hyderabad, India",University System of Georgia; Georgia State University; Swinburne University of Technology Sarawak; National Institute of Technology (NIT System); Malaviya National Institute of Technology Jaipur; Swinburne University of Technology,"Donthu, N (corresponding author), Georgia State Univ, Dept Mkt, POB 3991, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA.",ndonthu@gsu.edu,"Pattnaik, Debidutta/Q-2125-2019; Pattnaik, Debidutta/GWU-6164-2022; KUMAR, SATISH/M-8694-2017","Pattnaik, Debidutta/0000-0001-6180-0499; KUMAR, SATISH/0000-0001-5200-1476",,,,,158,5,5,18,43,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0091-3367,1557-7805,,J ADVERTISING,J.

Yet, there are ongoing concerns about data quality for online sources. This research examines differences in data quality for an advertising experiment across five popular online data sources, including professional panels and crowdsourced platforms. Effects of underlying mechanisms impacting data quality, including response satisficing, multitasking, and effort, are examined. As proposed, a serial mediation model shows that data source is, directly and indirectly, related to these antecedents of data quality. Satisficing is positively related to multitasking and negatively related to effort, and both mediators (in parallel) extend to data quality, indicating that the indirect effects on data quality through these mediating variables are significant. In general, a vetted MTurk sample (i.e., CloudResearch Approved) produces higher quality data than the other four sources. Regardless of the data source, researchers should utilize safeguards to ensure data quality. Safeguards and other strategies to obtain high-quality data from online samples are offered.","[Berry, Christopher] Colorado State Univ, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Kees, Jeremy] Villanova Univ, Business, Villanova, PA 19085 USA; [Burton, Scot] Univ Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA",Colorado State University; Villanova University; University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville,"Kees, J (corresponding author), Villanova Univ, Mkt Dept, Bartly 3006, Villanova, PA 19085 USA.",jeremy.kees@villanova.edu,,,,,,,47,1,1,7,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0091-3367,1557-7805,,J ADVERTISING,J.

The first study is used to qualitatively understand what makes an environment Instagrammable from the designer perspective. Emergent themes are used to inform a second study, a quantitative analysis of 43,004 instances of indirect advertising gathered by scraping Instagram postings from 97 environments in four prominent pop culture museums. After manually sorting the data, both artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled computer vision and manual coding are used to quantify multiple environment characteristics. Analysis reveals how different environment characteristics affect the creation of indirect advertising. Environments that use more interactive props, color, and brightness are associated with greater indirect advertising. Except in limited cases, most design themes have no effects-or negative effects-on indirect advertising. This article also contributes to the emerging literature on computer vision by showcasing how AI can offer insight for better understanding shared digital content.","[Campbell, Colin] Univ San Diego, Dept Mkt, Sch Business, 5998 Alcala Pk, San Diego, CA 92101 USA; [Sands, Sean] Swinburne Univ Technol, Dept Management & Mkt, Mkt, Hawthorn, Vic, Australia; [Montecchi, Matteo] Kings Coll London, Kings Business Sch, Mkt, London, England; [Schau, Hope Jensen] Univ Arizona, Eller Coll Management, Mkt, Tucson, AZ USA",University of San Diego; Swinburne University of Technology; University of London; King's College London; University of Arizona,"Campbell, C (corresponding author), Univ San Diego, Dept Mkt, Sch Business, 5998 Alcala Pk, San Diego, CA 92101 USA.",colincampbell@sandiego.edu,"Montecchi, Matteo/AAC-8853-2019","Montecchi, Matteo/0000-0001-5884-4503; Sands, Sean/0000-0001-9192-3676",,,,,102,2,2,17,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0091-3367,1557-7805,,J ADVERTISING,J.

Across three experiments, we showed the following results. First, the ad-skipping rate of emotional appeal ads was lower among consumers who had the goal of watching emotional (versus informational) videos. Second, ad-elicited empathy mediated this effect. Third, the effects of the emotional appeal ad on ad-skipping behaviors were contingent upon consumers' predisposition to approach emotional experiences. Among consumers who were seeking emotional experiences, higher levels of empathy resulted in lower ad-skipping rates and longer ad-viewing duration when the emotional appeal of the ad matched with the emotional goal of video watching; in contrast, among consumers who were not seeking emotional experiences, the opposite effect was found.","[Jeon, Yongwoog Andrew] Northern Illinois Univ, Coll Business, Dept Mkt, De Kalb, IL 60115 USA; [Ryoo, Yuhosua] Southern Illinois Univ, Coll Arts & Media, Sch Journalism & Advertising, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA; [Yoon, Hye Jin] Univ Georgia, Grady Coll Journalism & Mass Commun, Dept Advertising & Publ Relat, 120 Hooper St, Athens, GA 30602 USA",Northern Illinois University; Southern Illinois University System; Southern Illinois University; University System of Georgia; University of Georgia,"Yoon, HJ (corresponding author), Univ Georgia, Grady Coll Journalism & Mass Commun, Dept Advertising & Publ Relat, 120 Hooper St, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",hjyoon@uga.edu,"Ryoo, Yuhosua/AAE-3839-2020","Ryoo, Yuhosua/0000-0001-8153-9320",,,,,72,0,0,21,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0091-3367,1557-7805,,J ADVERTISING,J.

Narcissists are burdened with the duality of the overinflated self-view and the vulnerability of the unrealistic ego. They tend to be paranoid of the mere introspection of self-image, because such introspection can expose the vulnerability they have been diligent to avoid. Therefore, ads that are closely relevant to the viewer's self-image can lead to a negative affective response. Several experiments show support for this hypothesis and illustrate implications for advertising practice. Taking into consideration reports that narcissism is on the rise within the population, promotional ads that expect to encounter narcissistic consumers should consider the appeal relevant to self-image with caution, while preventive ads, such as those based on fear appeal, can benefit from enhanced relevance to this audience.","[He, Yang] Belmont Univ, Jack C Massey Coll Business, Mkt, Nashville, TN 37212 USA",Belmont University,"He, Y (corresponding author), Belmont Univ, Jack C Massey Coll Business, Barbara Massey Hall 245,1900 Belmont Blvd, Nashville, TN 37212 USA.",yang.he@belmont.edu,,,,,,,76,0,0,8,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0091-3367,1557-7805,,J ADVERTISING,J.

These theories emphasize emotional engagement as key to stories' persuasive influence. Researchers who build on these theories tend to assume that an audience will experience the emotions depicted by a focal character and examine emotional engagement with respect to intensity (i.e., amount of emotion experienced). The current work integrates insights from the appraisal theory of emotion to develop a framework of audience emotional engagement in stories. We expand the current conceptualization of emotional engagement in narratives to include the discrete emotion experienced while involved in the story as well as the event appraisals that elicit the emotions. We highlight antecedents of an audience's emotional response to a story and ways in which the appraisal theme associated with the discrete emotion experienced while emotionally engaged in a narrative ad explains variance in outcomes of importance to advertisers.","[Hamby, Anne; Jones, Niusha] Boise State Univ, Boise, ID 83725 USA",Idaho; Boise State University,"Hamby, A (corresponding author), Boise State Univ, Coll Business & Finance, 1910 Univ Dr, Boise, ID 83725 USA.",annehamby@boisestate.edu,,,,,,,108,1,1,7,41,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0091-3367,1557-7805,,J ADVERTISING,J.

However, technological innovations have given the advertising industry digital and automatic tools that enable advertisers to automate many advertising processes and produce synthetic ads, or ads comprising content based on the artificial and automatic production and modification of data. The emerging practice of synthetic advertising, to date the most sophisticated form of ad manipulation, relies on various artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, such as deepfakes and generative adversarial networks (GANs), to automatically create content that depicts an unreal, albeit convincing, artificial version of reality. In this article, a general framework is constructed to better understand how consumers respond to all forms of ad manipulation. It is anticipated that this article will help explain how consumers respond to the more sophisticated forms of synthetic ads-such as deepfakes-that are emerging at an accelerating rate. To guide research in this area, a research agenda is developed focusing on three manipulated advertising areas: ad falsity, consumer response, and originality.

One emoji, the smiley face, has been an important part of consumers' informal communications. Interestingly, smiley faces now also appear in marketing communications, advertisements, and brand logos. The present research examines the role of smiley faces in restaurant logos as a form of marketing communication. A set of five studies-conducted in a lab and at a middle school-demonstrates that communication associated with restaurant logos including smileys is perceived as lower in healthfulness, which in turn leads to lower price expectations. These effects are caused by a visual association with a fast-food restaurant category, whereby consumers link the presence of smiley faces with fast-food restaurants. The authors conclude that including a smiley face logo in a restaurant's marketing communication can have unintended consequences on consumers' perceptions.","[Abell, Annika] Univ Tennessee, Dept Mkt, Haslam Coll Business, 341 Stokely Management Ctr, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Smith, Leah] Univ Arkansas, Dept Mkt, Walton Coll Business, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA; [Biswas, Dipayan] Univ S Florida, Mkt, Dept Mkt, Muma Coll Business, Tampa, FL 33620 USA",University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville; University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville; State University System of Florida; University of South Florida,"Abell, A (corresponding author), Univ Tennessee, Dept Mkt, Haslam Coll Business, 341 Stokely Management Ctr, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.",akabell@utk.edu,,"Smith, Leah/0000-0002-1418-7529; Abell, Annika/0000-0002-9564-9974",Association for Consumer Research,Association for Consumer Research,This work was supported by a Transformative Consumer Research Grant from the Association for Consumer Research.,,56,0,0,47,47,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0091-3367,1557-7805,,J ADVERTISING,J.

Avoiding mobile banner ads differs from active ad avoidance in nonmobile (desktop) settings, because mobile phone users interact with ads to avoid them: (1) They classify new content at the bottom of their screens; if they see an ad, they (2) scroll so that it is out of the locus of attention and (3) position it at a peripheral location at the top of the screen while focusing their attention on the (non-ad) content in the screen center. Introducing viewport logging to marketing research, we capture granular ad-viewing patterns from users' screens (i.e., viewports). While mobile users' ad-viewing patterns are concave over the viewport (with more time at the periphery than in the screen center), viewing patterns on desktop computers are convex (most time in the screen center). Consequently, we show that the effect of viewing time on recall depends on the position of an ad in interaction with the device. An eye-tracking study and an experiment show that 43% to 46% of embedded mobile banner ads are likely to suffer from ad avoidance, and that ad recall is 6 to 7 percentage points lower on mobile phones (versus desktop).","[Schmidt, Lennard L.] Brandenburg Tech Univ Cottbus, Mkt, Cottbus, Germany; [Maier, Erik] HHL Leipzig Grad Sch Management, Mkt & Retail, Leipzig, Germany",Brandenburg University of Technology Cottbus; HHL Leipzig Graduate School of Management,"Maier, E (corresponding author), HHL Leipzig Grad Sch Management, Jahnallee 59, D-04109 Leipzig, Germany.",erik.maier@hhl.de,"Schmidt, Lennard Lukas/AFO-7881-2022","Schmidt, Lennard Lukas/0000-0003-2010-0685",,,,,30,2,2,20,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0091-3367,1557-7805,,J ADVERTISING,J.

Each has a unique vernacular-its popular communication style-which increases the need for firms to use platform-specific content optimization. This study distinguishes between textual and visual content intentions, depending on the degree of informative and affective appeals used. We examine how congruency between visual content and platform type and textual content affects users' sharing. We distinguish between hedonic platforms, such as Facebook, primarily used for entertainment and social interaction, and utilitarian platforms, such as Twitter, primarily used for receiving timely information. We develop a new approach to examine how textual and visual content composition affects users' sharing behavior across platforms. Based on this new approach, we analyze posts by S&P 500 members operating on Facebook and Twitter. Our results show that posts with visual content congruent with the primary user intent of the platforms are more likely to be shared. Furthermore, Facebook users prefer affective textual and visual content, while Twitter users are more inclined toward a combination of informative visual and affective textual content.","[Ahmadi, Iman] Univ Warwick, Coventry, W Midlands, England; [Waltenrath, Adrian] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany; [Ahmadi, Iman] Univ Warwick, Warwick Business Sch, Mkt, Coventry, W Midlands, England; [Waltenrath, Adrian] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Fac Econ & Business, Frankfurt, Germany",University of Warwick; Goethe University Frankfurt; University of Warwick; Goethe University Frankfurt,"Ahmadi, I (corresponding author), Univ Warwick, Warwick Business Sch, WBS Scarman Rd, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",iman.ahmadi@wbs.ac.uk,,"Waltenrath, Adrian/0000-0002-1141-7077; Ahmadi, Iman/0000-0002-4391-2857",,,,,82,0,0,20,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0091-3367,1557-7805,,J ADVERTISING,J.

Ads with lower audience retention ability lead to more consumer zapping. Given that several ads are sequentially broadcast during a commercial break, an ad with a low retention rate will negatively affect the viewership of subsequent ads by decreasing their opportunities to be exposed to viewers. In this case, the ad imposes a negative externality on subsequent ads in the same commercial break. This externality is typically not priced in the TV advertising market; however, it may substantially affect the TV network's profit. Based on a large and rich data set on TV viewing and advertising, we build a comprehensive model of consumer zapping and conduct various simulation studies to quantify the impact of the zapping-induced externality on the network's revenue. Results show that our focal network may increase gross revenue up to 19.38% by reordering ads during a commercial break so that the negative impact of this externality is minimized.","[Shi, Yang] Shenzhen Univ, WeBank Inst Fintech, Shenzhen Audencia Business Sch, 3688 Nanhai Rd, Shenzhen 518060, Peoples R China; [Kim, Jun B.] Seoul Natl Univ, Coll Business Adm, Seoul, South Korea; [Zhao, Ying] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Business, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Shenzhen University; Seoul National University (SNU); Hong Kong University of Science & Technology,"Shi, Y (corresponding author), Shenzhen Univ, WeBank Inst Fintech, Shenzhen Audencia Business Sch, 3688 Nanhai Rd, Shenzhen 518060, Peoples R China.",yolandashiy@connect.ust.hk,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71702201]; Shenzhen Natural Science Fund (Stable Support Plan Program) [20200814162504001]; Institute of Management Research at Seoul National University; Hong Kong Research Grants Council [16502017]; University Grants Committee of Hong Kong [SBI17BM15],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Shenzhen Natural Science Fund (Stable Support Plan Program); Institute of Management Research at Seoul National University; Hong Kong Research Grants Council(Hong Kong Research Grants Council); University Grants Committee of Hong Kong,This research is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71702201) and the Shenzhen Natural Science Fund (Stable Support Plan Program 20200814162504001) to Yang Shi; the Institute of Management Research at Seoul National University to Jun B.

Prior to reading a short story featuring an unfamiliar brand, participants were exposed to either a brand-unspecific, brand-specific, or no placement disclosure. A longitudinal design was employed, such that conceptual persuasion knowledge (advertising recognition) and author-related perceptions (trustworthiness, intrinsic and ulterior motives for inserting the brand) were measured immediately (Time 1), while brand purchase intention was measured both immediately (Time 1) and after a two-week delay (Time 2). Mediation analyses showed that (especially specific) disclosures enhance advertising recognition and increase perceptions of the author's ulterior (commercial) motives (both directly and via advertising recognition). Although disclosures did not influence purchase intention directly at either measurement point, they exerted an indirect negative effect on purchase intention at Time 2 via decreasing author trustworthiness.","[Avramova, Yana R.] Univ Antwerp, Fac Business & Econ, Mkt Dept, Prinsstr 13, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium; [Dens, Nathalie] Univ Antwerp, Fac Business & Econ, Mkt Dept, Mkt, Antwerp, Belgium; [De Pelsmacker, Patrick] Univ Ghent, Dept Mkt Innovat & Org, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Mkt, Ghent, Belgium",University of Antwerp; University of Antwerp; Ghent University,"Avramova, YR (corresponding author), Univ Antwerp, Fac Business & Econ, Mkt Dept, Prinsstr 13, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium.",yana.avramova@uantwerpen.be,,"Avramova, Yana/0000-0001-8189-4576; Dens, Nathalie/0000-0003-0640-3727",Research Foundation-Flanders (FWO) [1206119N],Research Foundation-Flanders (FWO)(FWO),This research was supported by a postdoctoral fellowship grant by the Research Foundation-Flanders (FWO) awarded to the first author [grant number 1206119N].,,72,1,1,5,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0091-3367,1557-7805,,J ADVERTISING,J.

However, there is a paucity of research investigating the role of celebrities in brand transgression contexts. Across two experimental studies, we examine whether and how celebrity endorsers influence consumers' reactions toward an endorsed brand following a transgression. Grounded in parasocial interaction theory, the findings reveal that parasocial relationships bolster brand trust and brand forgiveness through brand self-congruity. Moreover, we identify the impacts of transgression controllability and endorsement timing on brand outcomes (brand trust and brand forgiveness). Specifically, we find that celebrity endorsements can buffer negative impacts of a brand transgression; however, employing celebrity endorsement after a controllable brand transgression may be ineffective and possibly even counterproductive. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.","[Aw, Eugene Cheng-Xi] UCSI Univ, UCSI Grad Business Sch, Res & Postgrad Studies, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Labrecque, Lauren, I] Univ Rhode Isl, Coll Business, Mkt, Kingston, RI 02881 USA",UCSI University; University of Rhode Island,"Labrecque, LI (corresponding author), Univ Rhode Isl, Coll Business, 232 Ballantine, Kingston, RI 02881 USA.",lauren33@uri.edu,"Aw, Eugene Cheng-Xi/K-8475-2019; Labrecque, Lauren/L-6498-2015","Aw, Eugene Cheng-Xi/0000-0001-6712-1171; Labrecque, Lauren/0000-0002-3914-6707",,,,,84,1,1,23,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0091-3367,1557-7805,,J ADVERTISING,J.

It can enhance attention, facilitate recall, and drive emotional responses. However, there is continued opportunity to explore the boundary conditions regarding creativity's ability to break though clutter. This article looks at whether two types of interference-external interference and competitive interference-limit creativity's ability to enhance recall. We test this across three studies investigating the effects of these types of interference on individuals' ability to recall creative ads and brands. The first experiment tested external interference using digitally manipulated print ads and three external music conditions. The second experiment tested competitive interference through TV ads. A third study extended the second study by holding creativity constant within the interference conditions. Results indicate that creativity does indeed facilitate recall under limited interference. However, this effect is lost under conditions of high interference, implying that creativity can be dulled and lost in the noise. We find these effects under both immediate and one-week-delay recall conditions. These findings are important for researchers and managers as the positive impact of creativity may not be realized under conditions of high interference but may certainly be fully realized in conditions of low or moderate interference.","[Lehnert, Kevin] Grand Valley State Univ, Dept Mkt, Seidman Sch Business, L William Seidman Ctr 3116,50 Front Ave Southwest, Grand Rapids, MI 49504 USA; [Till, Brian D.] Marquette Univ, Mkt, Milwaukee, WI 53233 USA; [Coble, Kyle] Lindenwood Univ, Mkt, St Charles, MO USA; [Arnold, Mark J.] St Louis Univ, Dept Mkt, Richard A Chaifetz Sch Business, St Louis, MO 63103 USA",Grand Valley State University; Marquette University; Saint Louis University,"Lehnert, K (corresponding author), Grand Valley State Univ, Dept Mkt, Seidman Sch Business, L William Seidman Ctr 3116,50 Front Ave Southwest, Grand Rapids, MI 49504 USA.",lehnertk@gvsu.edu,,,,,,,71,0,0,4,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0091-3367,1557-7805,,J ADVERTISING,J.

Findings from two experimental studies indicate that predominantly promotion-focused consumers are more receptive and respond more favorably to highly personalized chatbot advertising because they attend more to benefits they may gain from disclosing personal information. In contrast, consumers who are predominantly prevention focused are more attentive to the risks involved and feel unfavorably toward highly personalized chatbot advertising. In addition, consumers who are highly concerned about privacy disdain highly personalized ads, regardless of regulatory focus.

We introduce a new concept, forestalgia, or a consumer's yearning for an idealized future. To understand the impact of nostalgia and forestalgia, qualitative background interviews were conducted with creative directors and other advertising creatives from numerous nationally recognized advertising agencies. Building on the insights from the interviews and using construal level theory as our foundation, we explore consumer response to hedonic and utilitarian products when appeals employ far-past, near-past, near-future, and far-future framing. Thus, we examine whether nostalgia or forestalgia is better suited for certain products. We find utilitarian products are better received with a temporal distance that is far from the present with hedonic products better suited for appeals framed in the far past and near future. Managerial and theoretical implications are discussed, along with future research considerations.","[Barnwell, R.

The agenda addresses the definition and operationalization of age and older people and discusses how their representation and portrayal must be evaluated against appropriate baseline figures; how stereotyping can be assessed and measured; how positive perceptions and evaluations of portrayals of older people, despite weak representation and stereotyping, can be explained; and how social and commercial effects can be investigated.

Using three field studies, we demonstrate that advertisers may selectively invoke the performance enhancement effect among owners of branded products through brand advertising. Our findings show that exposure to brand advertising can increase performance (i.e., exercise duration in our studies) in excess of 20%. Moreover, we show that brand advertising elicits this enhancement effect only when the target, owned brand is in use and that heightened motivation underlies this effect. Furthermore, the enhancement effect, while sizable, does not last into perpetuity. Instead, we show that consumers acclimate over extended periods of exposure to the brand advertising, consistent with psychological habituation theory. These findings point to the importance of ongoing, novel brand advertising over the product ownership life cycle.","[Germann, Frank] Univ Notre Dame, Mendoza Coll Business, Mkt, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Garvey, Aaron M.] Univ Kentucky, Gatton Coll Business & Econ, Mkt, Lexington, KY USA",University of Notre Dame; University of Kentucky,"Germann, F (corresponding author), Notre Dame Univ, Mendoza Coll Business, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.",fgermann@nd.edu,,,,,,,69,0,0,3,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0091-3367,1557-7805,,J ADVERTISING,J.

The results demonstrated significant impact of consumers' temporary affective states, induced by the performance of the team they cheer for, on their engagement with different types of ads, even when they were exposed to the same set of ads during commercial breaks. Specifically, consumers in the positive affective state showed greater tendency to be drawn to engage with high semantic-affinity ads than those in the negative affective state. Consumers in the negative affective state showed greater tendency to be drawn to engage with more positively valenced ads than those in the positive affective state.

We addressed this question by conceptualizing these two filtering types as cues that trigger cognitive heuristics (mental shortcuts), following the heuristic-systematic model in social psychology. In addition, we investigated whether the degree to which the recommendation matches user preferences (or other users' endorsements) provides an argument for systematic processing, especially for those who need deeper insights into the accuracy of the algorithm, particularly in product categories where quality is subjective. Data from a 2 (algorithm type: content vs. collaborative filtering) x 3 (percentage match: low vs. medium vs. high) x 2 (product category: search vs. experience) + 2 (control: search and experience) between-subjects experiment (N = 469) reveal that for experience products, consumers prefer content-based filtering with higher percentage matches, because it is perceived as offering more transparency. This is especially true for individuals with high need for cognition. For search products, however, collaborative filtering leads to more positive evaluations by triggering the bandwagon effect. These findings have implications for theory pertaining to the use of artificial intelligence in strategic communications and design of algorithms for e-commerce recommender systems.","[Liao, Mengqi] Penn State Univ, Donald P Bellisario Coll Commun, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Sundar, S.

In study 1 (N = 202), we test a parallel mediation via perceived personal relevance and intrusiveness on brand attitude (Ab) and click intention (CI). Perceived personalization improves Ab and CI by increasing the perceived personal relevance and, unexpectedly, by decreasing the perceived intrusiveness of the ad. Study 2 (N = 264) extends the processing mechanism of personalized advertising by additionally including the mediating effects of self-brand connection and reactance toward the ad. Perceived personalization has a positive indirect effect on self-brand connection via perceived personal relevance, but not via perceived intrusiveness. Self-brand connection, in turn, has a positive effect on consumers' responses. Contrary to expectations, reactance does not significantly affect brand responses. Study 2 also examines the moderating role of perceived privacy protection by the SNS.

The article also delineates the nostalgic advertising literature; identifies antecedents, moderators, and consequences of nostalgic advertising; and highlights research gaps. Finally, this work offers propositions on nostalgic ad appeals (those that emphasize the attractiveness of and yearning for the past in a bittersweet way) based on four themes: self-restoration, continuity, social relationships, and culture. Specifically, the propositions offer new moderators, such as ads' emotional flow, gender identity, purchase and consumption situation, perceived interactivity, and culture type, that could make some types of nostalgic appeals more effective than others. Our work contributes by being more comprehensive and broad based, extending the typology framework and delineating propositions that lay out a research roadmap for nostalgic advertising.","[Srivastava, Ekta] Indian Inst Management Kozhikode, Mkt, Kozhikode, Kerala, India; [Sivakumaran, Bharadhwaj] SRM Univ, Sch Entrepreneurship & Management Studies, Amaravati, Andhra Pradesh, India; [Maheswarappa, Satish S.] Indian Inst Management Tiruchirappalli, Mkt, Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu, India; [Paul, Justin] Univ Puerto Rico, Grad Sch Business Adm, San Juan, PR 00936 USA",Indian Institute of Management (IIM System); Indian Institute of Management Kozhikode; SRM University-AP; Indian Institute of Management (IIM System); Indian Institute of Management Tiruchirappalli; University of Puerto Rico,"Srivastava, E (corresponding author), Indian Inst Management Kozhikode, IIM Kozhikode Campus Post, Kozhikode 673570, Kerala, India.",ekta.srivastava@iiml.org,,"PAUL, JUSTIN/0000-0001-5062-8371",,,,,130,0,0,31,31,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0091-3367,1557-7805,,J ADVERTISING,J.

TAR examines problems and opportunities across the advertising system with the goal of transforming it toward better outcomes, namely cultivating individual, institutional, and societal well-being. We present a conceptual framework on TAR, informed by institutional theory, that highlights the transformational insights revealed in the intersections and interactions between institutional actors at the micro level, advertising institutions at the meso level, and sociocultural forces at the macro level and the resulting well-being outcomes. To illustrate our framework, we focus on a long-standing topical issue within advertising-gender inequality-that holds significant implications for well-being. In conceptualizing advertising as an institution, (1) we propose a new subfield of advertising we name TAR and (2) we present a framework that reveals the system complexities within the advertising ecosystem and allows for a clear vision of potential transformative outcomes, which (3) can guide and inspire scholars and practitioners with directions to engage in social change.","[Gurrieri, Lauren] RMIT Univ, Sch Econ Finance & Mkt, 435-457 Swanston St, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia; [Zayer, Linda Tuncay] Loyola Univ, Quinlan Sch Business, Business Adm, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Zayer, Linda Tuncay] Loyola Univ, Quinlan Sch Business, Mkt, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Coleman, Catherine A.] Texas Christian Univ, Dept Strateg Commun, Ft Worth, TX 76129 USA",Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT); Loyola University Chicago; Loyola University Chicago; Texas Christian University,"Gurrieri, L (corresponding author), RMIT Univ, Sch Econ Finance & Mkt, 435-457 Swanston St, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia.",lauren.gurrieri@rmit.edu.au,,"Zayer, Linda Tuncay/0000-0001-6441-1093",,,,,125,1,1,9,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0091-3367,1557-7805,,J ADVERTISING,J.

The current research examines whether this type of narrative achieves advertiser-desired outcomes. If these outcomes are achieved, how? The results from five studies demonstrate that eudaimonic narratives enhance the value of, attitude toward, and purchase intentions for products featured in the story. This occurs because the product becomes a symbol for the meaningful theme communicated in the narrative. The effect of eudaimonic narratives on valuation is stronger when a product is central to the narrative plot and when consumers have experienced a threat to their worldview coherence; the effect disappears when people consider giving the focal product as a gift.","[Hamby, Anne] Boise State Univ, Coll Business & Econ, Mkt, Boise, ID 83725 USA; [Tezer, Ali] HEC Montreal, Mkt HEC, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Escalas, Jennifer Edson] Vanderbilt Univ, Owen Grad Sch Management, Mkt, 221 Kirkland Hall, Nashville, TN 37235 USA",Idaho; Boise State University; Universite de Montreal; HEC Montreal; Vanderbilt University,"Hamby, A (corresponding author), Boise State Univ, Coll Business & Econ, 1910 Univ Dr, Boise, ID 83725 USA.",annehamby@boisestate.edu,,,,,,,55,1,1,17,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0091-3367,1557-7805,,J ADVERTISING,J.

The current article posits that such strategies can lead to a perceived claim-fact discrepancy and examines to what extent this makes consumers feel deceived and detracts from attitudes and purchase intentions, even though consumers can intrinsically value the (partial) sustainability improvements. In addition, given that marketing communication often relies on puffery such as exaggerated language and (visual) hyperbole, the article also investigates the effect of the use of puffery versus more subdued claims. Findings from two experiments unveil that when the actual sustainability of packaged products is (partially) discrepant with an overt sustainability claim, this leads to higher perceived deception. The use of puffery has both pros and cons, such that it adds to perceived sustainability but also to perceived deception, and it moderates the effects of actual sustainability. Furthermore, the results provide initial support for the idea that sustainability improvements in only peripheral attributes (packaging) are perceived as more deceptive than sustainability improvements in only central attributes (product contents).","[Steenis, Nigel D.; van Herpen, Erica; van der Lans, Ivo A.; van Trijp, Hans C.

It was a prominent theoretical perspective for scholars in the 1980s but has been neglected in recent years. Moreover, what little research does exist on the FCB grid seems to misunderstand one of its primary tenets: that its axes of thinking, feeling, and involvement do not label the products themselves but the way consumers think about purchasing these products. This is unfortunate, because the situational thinking that the grid stimulates is ideal for a world where media channels are increasingly digital and social. In this article, we outline the FCB grid's original propositions as a strategic tool and discuss some of ways it has been misinterpreted along the way. We then explicate its potential for practitioners and scholars in the contemporary media environment, propose our own grid of appropriate channels for each quadrant, and offer some guidance for future scholars to leverage this theory moving forward.","[Haley, Eric; Pittman, Matthew] Univ Tennessee, Knoxville, TN USA",University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville,"Haley, E (corresponding author), Univ Tennessee, Tombras Sch Advertising & Publ Relat, 1345 Circle Pk Dr,476 Commun Bldg, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.",haley@utk.edu,,"Pittman, Matthew/0000-0002-8719-7605",,,,,53,3,3,5,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0091-3367,1557-7805,,J ADVERTISING,J.

However, not all agree, and some scholars point to a dark side of apparently good relationships-an alternative tradition that is based on agency theory. This approach suggests agencies can take advantage of clients who are highly committed. Our research focuses on the agency perspective to this question and collects data on 518 campaigns from London and Amsterdam agencies. We show both traditions have merit in that the two processes operate simultaneously. When agencies perceive that the quality of their client relationship is low, the professionalism of agency personnel shines through developing original, strategic, and creative work. But when relationship quality is considered high, dark side problems emerge. However, there is a bright side to good relationships. Creativity theory suggests that a good relationship can increase the intrinsic motivation of agency staff such that their increased passion for the work offsets dark side problems-something for which we find empirical support.","[Koslow, Scott; Sameti, Ardalan] Macquarie Univ, Macquarie Pk, Australia; [van Noort, Guda; Smit, Edith G.] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Sasser, Sheila L.] Eastern Michigan Univ, Ypsilanti, MI 48197 USA",Macquarie University; University of Amsterdam; Eastern Michigan University,"Koslow, S (corresponding author), Macquarie Univ, Macquarie Business Sch, Dept Mkt, Room 158B,3 Management Dr, Macquarie Pk, NSW 2109, Australia.",scott.koslow@mq.edu.au,,"Koslow, Scott/0000-0002-3601-5197; van Noort, Guda/0000-0002-6314-1455; Sameti, Ardalan/0000-0003-3607-8988; Smit, Edith/0000-0002-6913-4897",,,,,78,1,1,2,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0091-3367,1557-7805,,J ADVERTISING,J.

Study 1 with 5,193 ad evaluations by 1,731 subjects from two countries shows that the overall perceived offensiveness in nudity advertising was higher in Asia (China) than in Western Europe (Austria). While previous research indicates that same-ethnicity endorsers are typically favorable for advertising outcomes, our study demonstrates that same-ethnicity endorsers in nudity advertising led to a higher perceived offensiveness and more negative advertising outcomes in Asia, as compared to endorsers of other ethnicities. In Western Europe, in contrast, same-ethnicity endorsers led to a lower perceived offensiveness and more positive advertising outcomes. A follow-up experiment with 373 subjects validated the results. We suggest a model of multi-ethnic offensive nudity advertising effects that is tested with structural equation modeling. Our findings have implications for international advertising theory and international advertising practice.","[Terlutter, Ralf] Univ Klagenfurt, Mkt & Int Management, Klagenfurt, Austria; [Diehl, Sandra; Koinig, Isabell] Univ Klagenfurt, Media & Commun, Klagenfurt, Austria; [Chan, Kara; Tsang, Lennon] Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Commun, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",University of Klagenfurt; University of Klagenfurt; Hong Kong Baptist University,"Terlutter, R (corresponding author), Univ Klagenfurt, A-9020 Klagenfurt, Austria.",ralf.terlutter@aau.at,,"Chan, Kara/0000-0001-9805-7299; Tsang, Lennon/0000-0002-6927-7804; Terlutter, Ralf/0000-0003-2284-5816; Diehl, Sandra/0000-0002-0422-5579",,,,,124,2,2,7,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0091-3367,1557-7805,,J ADVERTISING,J.

The Role of Perceived Autonomy,JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING,,,English,Article; Early Access,,,,,,,SELF-DETERMINATION; GUILT; MOTIVATION; REACTANCE; ENJOYMENT; BEHAVIOR; APPEALS; GENDER; CHOICE; IMPACT,"When powered by artificial intelligence (AI), the effectiveness of advertising generally improves. However, evidence shows that personalized recommendations in charity advertising may have a dark side. The existing literature about the effects of personalized recommendations in advertising is rooted primarily in outcome utility, including outcome benefits and costs. Nevertheless, consumers tend to sacrifice their own interests without expecting anything in return given that they cannot directly monitor and measure the behavior outcome in charitable consumption; this elicits in them a focus on their autonomy and signal utility in responding to charity advertising. Thus, in our article, we focus on the reasons that personalized recommendations have negative effects in charity advertising based on self-determination theory. Through five studies, the results reveal that consumers display lower donation intentions when they receive charity advertising with (versus without) personalized recommendations due to a decrease in perceived autonomy. In addition, this negative effect can be mitigated by servant communication styles and providing consumers with free choices. These conclusions not only enrich the literature on personalized recommendations in advertising, charity advertising, and AI marketing but also provide some guidance for advertisers to enhance the performance of personalized recommendations in charity advertising.","[Lv, Linxiang; Huang, Minxue] Wuhan Univ, Econ & Management Sch, Bayi Rd, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China",Wuhan University,"Huang, MX (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, Econ & Management Sch, Bayi Rd, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China.",huangminxue@whu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [91746206, 72172109]; China Scholarship Council",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council),"This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (91746206, 72172109) and China Scholarship Council.",,70,0,0,36,36,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0091-3367,1557-7805,,J ADVERTISING,J.

Consumer information, in the form of consumer research or evaluations of consumer responses, is presumed to be the building block of consumer insights for agencies seeking more effective communication with consumers. Successful agencies are presumed to have the capacity to absorb consumer insights and utilize them to develop effective advertising strategies. But consumer insights do not always translate seamlessly into a strategy dialogue. Absorbing and using external knowledge has costs beyond those of acquisition or simply employing creative people. Agencies, through their sociocognitive processes, have to actively identify useful information, make it accessible to the organization, and then exploit it to develop creative ideas. A study is presented on how group dynamics influence knowledge absorption, which then shapes the emergence of creative ideas. Group cohesion and interpersonal friction are examined. Subjects include 184 advertising practitioners reporting on 548 campaigns. Results show that in some group settings effective absorption of external information occurs, which improves the creative quality of promotional campaigns. However, in other situations the work changes in character, shifting from more original to more appropriate, rather than improving overall creativity.","[O'Connor, Huw; Kilgour, Mark] Univ Waikato, Waikato Management Sch, Sch Management & Mkt, Mkt, Hamilton, New Zealand; [Koslow, Scott] Macquarie Univ, Business Sch, Dept Mkt, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia",University of Waikato; Macquarie University,"Koslow, S (corresponding author), Macquarie Univ, Business Sch, Dept Mkt, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia.",scott.koslow@mq.edu.au,,"Koslow, Scott/0000-0002-3601-5197",,,,,104,0,0,4,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0091-3367,1557-7805,,J ADVERTISING,J.

This research investigates how the lateral display of an upcycled product's past identity relative to its present identity changes consumers' evaluations of upcycled product advertisements and their word-of-mouth (WOM) intentions. Across four studies, including an eye-tracking experiment, we demonstrate that consumers evaluate an upcycled product advertisement more (vs. less) favorably when the product's past identity is presented to the left (vs. the right) of its present identity, which, in turn, affects consumers' WOM on social media. We suggest that this lateral display effect is driven by consumers' spatial representation of time.

This study investigates practitioner views on attributes and styles of effective agency leaders in the US, UK, and Australia using GLOBE's (Global Leadership and Organizational Behavior Effectiveness) Culturally Endorsed Leadership Theory. All three regions are part of GLOBE's Anglo cultural cluster. The research examines whether the theory's central proposition-that leadership in global contexts has universally endorsed elements but is also culturally contingent-is valid in an advertising setting. Using a mixed-method approach, data were collected from agency staff and leaders via 255 survey responses and 40 in-depth interviews. Findings indicate that the best leaders are seen as people-focused, collaboration-driven, and future-oriented. Integrity, vision, and inspiration are top leadership attributes, with collaborative and performance-oriented leadership styles considered the most effective. Views were fairly consistent across regions, with some nuanced differences. One interesting difference from main GLOBE findings is the emphasis on soft skills as a core component of effective leadership. Future research should examine this further, as well as the relationship between leadership and agency culture, millennial and gender differences, and leadership training challenges and also examine advertising leadership across other GLOBE cultural clusters.","[Patwardhan, Padmini; Patwardhan, Hemant] Winthrop Univ, Rock Hill, SC 29733 USA; [Kerr, Gayle; Kelly, Louise] Queensland Univ Technol, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Habib, Sabrina] Univ South Carolina, Columbia, SC 29208 USA; [Mortimer, Kathleen; Laurie, Sally] Univ Northampton, Northampton, England",Queensland University of Technology (QUT); University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia; University of Northampton,"Patwardhan, P (corresponding author), Winthrop Univ, Dept Mass Commun, 214 Johnson Hall, Rock Hill, SC 29733 USA.",patwardhanp@winthrop.edu,"DURAN, MARTA/GLU-4438-2022","Mortimer, Kathleen/0000-0003-1357-2502; laurie, sally/0000-0001-7629-2909; Kerr, Gayle/0000-0002-5463-600X; Kelly, Louise/0000-0002-1260-8254",American Academy of Advertising; Winthrop Research Council,American Academy of Advertising; Winthrop Research Council,This work was supported by a Research Fellowship from the American Academy of Advertising and a Winthrop Research Council grant awarded to the first author.,,72,0,0,2,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0091-3367,1557-7805,,J ADVERTISING,J.

In this article, we propose the bifold triadic relationships model to help advertising scholars understand how advertising may work in the metaverse and to guide future research endeavors. Although the metaverse as a concept has yet to fully form, we hope that this primer presents a clearer layout of how advertising can be studied at the unit level of triadic relationships among consumer, media, and engagement behaviors in the metaverse space.

Even though this allows parties to target citizens based on their age, gender, or even specific interests, there is often a mismatch between the parties and the individuals' party preferences. This study investigates how different degrees of targeting disclosures (demographic/location-based targeting disclosure versus preference-based targeting disclosure) and the political fit of targeted ads (high fit versus low fit) affect participants' party evaluation and online privacy behaviors. Two dimensions of persuasion knowledge, perceived manipulative intent (PMI) and targeting knowledge (TK), act as mediators. Results from an online experiment (N = 430) reveal that the degree of targeting disclosure did not activate these dimensions. However, high political fit of the ads led to lower PMI and higher TK. In addition, political fit improved party evaluations via PMI and TK and reduced privacy behaviors via PMI. We conclude that citizens do not activate their defense mechanisms against targeted ads when the targeting comes from a favored party.","[Binder, Alice; Stubenvoll, Marlis; Hirsch, Melanie; Matthes, Joerg] Univ Vienna, Dept Commun, Advertising & Media Psychol Res Grp, Wahringer Str 29, A-1090 Vienna, Austria",University of Vienna,"Binder, A (corresponding author), Univ Vienna, Dept Commun, Advertising & Media Psychol Res Grp, Wahringer Str 29, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.",alice.binder@univie.ac.at,"Matthes, Jorg/B-5598-2009","Matthes, Jorg/0000-0001-9408-955X; Stubenvoll, Marlis/0000-0003-1870-0403; Binder, Alice/0000-0003-3266-8614",,,,,68,0,0,18,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0091-3367,1557-7805,,J ADVERTISING,J.

COVID-19 brought much uncertainty into the lives of people across the world, providing a unique window into the various constructs and individual preferences related to religion and spirituality. While previous findings focus on the importance of religious cues and religiosity in advertising, scholars have not paid much attention to spirituality. A growing number of Americans do not identify with any religion, and studies about the nonreligious, especially atheists and agnostics, are relatively scant. Therefore, the aim of the current study, grounded in congruity theory and cue utilization theory, was to align ad orientation (religious versus spiritual) with individual life orientation (religious versus nonreligious) to explore the impact of these relationships on advertising effectiveness. Findings show that Christians had strong and favorable attitudes toward both the religious and spiritual ads but stronger intention to learn more about the brand only after exposure to the religious ad. In contrast, nonreligious participants had significantly more favorable attitudes and higher intention after exposure to the spiritual ad (versus religious ad). These findings contribute to an initial theoretical understanding of these two groups, with important implications for advertisers.","[La Ferle, Carrie] Southern Methodist Univ, Temerlin Advertising Inst, Eth & Culture, Dallas, TX USA; [Muralidharan, Sidharth] Southern Methodist Univ, Temerlin Advertising Inst, POB 750113, Dallas, TX 75275 USA; [Roth-Cohen, Osnat] Ariel Univ, Sch Commun, Ariel, Israel",Southern Methodist University; Southern Methodist University; Ariel University,"Muralidharan, S (corresponding author), Southern Methodist Univ, Temerlin Advertising Inst, POB 750113, Dallas, TX 75275 USA.",sidmurali@smu.edu,"Roth-Cohen, Osnat/AAC-1667-2021; Muralidharan, Sidharth/AAA-6484-2020","Roth-Cohen, Osnat/0000-0001-6072-0091; Muralidharan, Sidharth/0000-0003-0982-5298; La Ferle, Carrie/0000-0002-5894-101X",Ariel University Grants Program for COVID-19 Research (Israel); Meadows School of the Arts at Southern Methodist University; Temerlin Advertising Institute at Southern Methodist University; Marriott Family Endowed Professor Award at Southern Methodist University,Ariel University Grants Program for COVID-19 Research (Israel); Meadows School of the Arts at Southern Methodist University; Temerlin Advertising Institute at Southern Methodist University; Marriott Family Endowed Professor Award at Southern Methodist University,"We are grateful to have received funding from the following sources to help undertake this research: Ariel University Grants Program for COVID-19 Research (Israel), the Meadows School of the Arts, the Temerlin Advertising Institute, and the Marriott Family Endowed Professor Award at Southern Methodist University.",,59,0,0,6,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0091-3367,1557-7805,,J ADVERTISING,J.

According to Lance W Bennett and Alexandra Segerberg, digital activism involves a logic of 'connective action', in which collective action and collective identity lose importance. To assess the validity of this theory, I focus on personal testimony campaigns that have by now become a familiar digital tactic, especially in online mobilisations around issues of gender and sexuality. Drawing on discourse analysis of some of the most prominent examples, from #MeToo to #GirlsLikeUs, I argue that more than a logic of connection, what is at stake here is a 'logic of collection', involved in gathering personal testimonies as specimens of various grievances people are affected by (sexual harassment, discrimination, etc.). Aggregating personal testimonies around shared hashtags provides a means to construct and/or trasform the collective identity of the groups involved in order to raise their self-awareness and place them in a better position to engage in collective action. These practices thus suggest the need to overcome the opposition between personal and collective identity inherent in the theory of 'connective action', and refocus research on the forms of online identification that connect these two levels.","[Gerbaudo, Paolo] Scuola Normal Super, Florence, Italy; [Gerbaudo, Paolo] Kings Coll London, London, England",University of London; King's College London,"Gerbaudo, P (corresponding author), Scuola Normale Super, Fac Polit & Social Sci, Piazza Strozzi, Florence, Italy.",paolo.gerbaudo@sns.it,,,,,,,53,0,0,3,3,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1177/14614448221128523,0,,44835,18,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,5P6YR,,,,,44885,WOS:000873294800001,0

Discussions gave impetus to advocacy around sexual molestation. While the word victim was used in more instances rather than the human rights-based term survivor, Twitter debates were supportive toward survivors of assault. There was minimum trolling and patriarchy was called out as was a legal system that sided with the influential man of power.

And even if algorithmic sorting is increasingly employed to deliver what is relevant at the right-time, the notion of real-time still permeates these platforms' operations. Through a critical phenomenological approach, I examine the interplay of chronological and algorithmic ordering. To operationalize the idea of temporality as both subjectively experienced and always arranged by the platforms themselves, I use rhythm as an analytical device. Based on accounts of lived experience obtained through the conduction of the diary-interview method with London-based social media users, I foreground how the algorithm is used as a vehicle to make sense of platforms' temporalities, reflecting struggles and negotiations over social coordination and temporal control. I argue that realtimeness is also rhythmic, and can therefore be scrutinized as a sensorial orchestration.","[Lupinacci, Ludmila] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Media & Commun, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Lupinacci, L (corresponding author), London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Media & Commun, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",L.Lupinacci-Amaral@lse.ac.uk,,,,,,,49,0,0,11,11,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1177/14614448221109952,0,,44743,21,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,3F2PY,,"Green Accepted, hybrid",,,44885,WOS:000830513900001,0

Based on a multistakeholder ethnography of carework labor platforms, online careworker forums, and interviews, this study describes scams on carework labor platforms. Labor platforms narrate workers into the role of technology consumers, constricting their own obligations to workers. Workers' explanations of scams vary, with some contesting and others aligning with platform narratives. Some workers seek support in online forums, which remediate the harm of scams for some but also enroll workers in unpaid labor.

However, individuals remain reluctant to verify and correct misinformation, suggesting a need to develop persuasion strategies to motivate such behaviors. Therefore, with an experiment of 256 participants recruited from Amazon MTurk, this study examines how effectively norm-based messages improve positive behavioral intentions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings suggest that among individuals with high perceived severity of misinformation, exposure to both descriptive and injunctive norms about verification reduced their intention to rectify misinformation. However, both descriptive and injunctive norms about debunking misinformation increased intentions to engage in preventive behaviors.

Therefore, even in countries where Internet use is an integral part of children's lives, interventions should be made to prevent perceived offline discrimination translating into digital inequalities.","[Mascheroni, Giovanna] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Dept Commun & Performing Arts, Largo Gemelli 1, I-20123 Milan, Italy; [Cino, Davide] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Dept Commun, Milan, Italy; [Mikuska, Jakub] Masaryk Univ, Interdisciplinary Res Team Internet & Soc, Brno, Czech Republic; [Smahel, David] Masaryk Univ, Fac Social Studies, Brno, Czech Republic; [Smahel, David] Masaryk Univ, Fac Informat, Brno, Czech Republic",Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; Masaryk University Brno; Masaryk University Brno; Masaryk University Brno,"Mascheroni, G (corresponding author), Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Dept Commun & Performing Arts, Largo Gemelli 1, I-20123 Milan, Italy.",giovanna.mascheroni@unicatt.it,"Smahel, David/G-5395-2017; Cino, Davide/AEL-4459-2022","Smahel, David/0000-0003-2767-4331; Mascheroni, Giovanna/0000-0002-6939-2650",European Union [870612],European Union(European Commission),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship and/or publication of this article: The research reported here is part of the project Youth Skills (ySKILLS) and received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research & Innovation Programme under Grant Agreement no. 870612.",,52,0,0,17,32,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,FEB,2022,24,2,,,SI,,437,457,,10.1177/14614448211063184,0,,,21,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,YX7ZK,,hybrid,,,44885,WOS:000754316300010,0

We integrate injunctive and descriptive norms into news comment research, assuming that the degree of salience of the respective norm influences the commenting behavior. Furthermore, we discuss how technical affordances such as default comment sorting determine the comment visibility and thus the salience of norms. Using data from a content analysis of 8162 comments on eight German news sites, we investigate how the two norm types influence deliberative forms of commenting. The results show that different types of salient injunctive and descriptive norms promote norm-compliant commenting. Furthermore, the default comment sorting can determine which comments are more or less salient. The results underline the importance of distinguishing different norm types in analyzing the quality of user comments in comment sections.","[Engelmann, Ines; Marzinkowski, Hanna; Langmann, Klara] Friedrich Schiller Univ Jena, Inst Commun Sci, Ernst Abbe Pl 8, D-07743 Jena, Germany",Friedrich Schiller University of Jena,"Marzinkowski, H (corresponding author), Friedrich Schiller Univ Jena, Inst Commun Sci, Ernst Abbe Pl 8, D-07743 Jena, Germany.",hanna.marzinkowski@uni-jena.de,,"Engelmann, Ines/0000-0002-3236-9895; Marzinkowski, Hanna/0000-0002-8796-2346","German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG) [EN 1117/1-1]","German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG))","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG) under Grant No. EN 1117/1-1.",,58,0,0,5,14,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,,,,,,,,,,,1.46144E+16,10.1177/14614448211068104,0,,44562,20,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,YP9SK,,hybrid,,,44885,WOS:000748959600001,0

It focuses on the research project Computerized Mapping of Disease (MOD) (1965-1968), where the epistemological promise of overlaying was made explicit and in relation to new technological affordances. I argue that the MOD project points to a dual shift in the meaning of overlaying for correlation inference during its attempted computerization: the transformation of overlaying from an implicit practice toward an explicit epistemic resource and toward a conceptual schema for reflecting about the nature of correlations, which effectively promoted the technology of overlaying as a new apparatus of implication. Overall, the article proposes an epistemiologically reflexive take on the history of geomedia practices.","[Kraemer, Steffen] Univ Konstanz, Dept Literature Art & Media, Constance, Germany; [Kraemer, Steffen] Univ Konstanz, Res Inst Social Cohesion, Constance, Germany",University of Konstanz; University of Konstanz,"Kramer, S (corresponding author), Univ Konstanz, Bischofsvilla Otto Adam Str 5, D-78467 Constance, Germany.",steffen.kraemer@uni-konstanz.de,,"Kramer, Steffen/0000-0003-4677-0580",,,,,39,0,0,1,1,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,NOV,2022,24,11,,,SI,,2419,2437,,10.1177/14614448221122193,0,,,19,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,5D7FH,,,,,44885,WOS:000865102100003,0

Yet, platform dependency also exists on a spectrum: size, business model, and market position impact how each news organization strategizes its reliance on digital platforms. I draw on in-depth interviews with 22 South Korean news professionals to delve into different survival strategies in dealing with South Korea's biggest search portal and news aggregator, Naver. Findings reveal that contrary to the common belief, journalists in legacy news organizations experience more pressure and compromise journalistic values with clickbait headlines. They deem their relationship with the platform more in hierarchical and inevitable terms while journalists from new, emerging organizations are relatively freer from the competition for clicks and strive for more quality journalism. However, the difference stems from the Naver platform's news organization ranking system and its tiered visibility structure that systematically creates the difference in audience reach and news distribution.","[Pyo, Jane Yeahin] Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Pyo, JY (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",ypyo2@illinois.edu,,"Pyo, Jane Yeahin/0000-0003-4495-1265",,,,,43,0,0,6,6,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1177/14614448221123279,0,,44805,17,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,4T8RX,,,,,44885,WOS:000858378000001,0

Drawing on Swidler's concepts of the cultural tool kit and cultural logic, we find that in this time of uncertainty, workers defaulted to the focus on personal responsibility that is inherent in insecurity culture. Following the cultural logic of personal responsibility, job seekers did not place blame on job search websites for allowing the scams to be posted, but normalized the situation, deploying a scam detection repertoire in response. In addition, the discovery that advertised good jobs are often scams affecting workers' desire to continue job hunting and perceptions of potential future success.","[Ravenelle, Alexandrea J.; Janko, Erica; Kowalski, Ken Cai] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Sociol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina School of Medicine,"Ravenelle, AJ (corresponding author), Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Dept Sociol, Hamilton Hall,Campus Box 3210, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",aravenelle@unc.edu,,"Kowalski, Ken/0000-0002-4502-8838",National Science Foundation [2029924],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 2029924.",,57,0,0,8,8,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,JUL,2022,24,7,,,,,1591,1610,,10.1177/14614448221099223,0,,,20,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,3A7BM,,hybrid,,,44885,WOS:000827410900004,0

Most streamers and viewers seem uncomfortable with 'serious' in-game narrative content, resulting in weighty or emotional moments in games becoming sources of comedy and humour. Many also subvert the platform's power dynamics by mocking community standards or the possibility of being banned, while some go even further and treat streamers themselves as fair game for mockery. This article thus examines how the humour of play, games and the Internet combine and evolve in an emerging and distinctive 'stream-humour', which can be sometimes playful and supportive yet sometimes shade into antagonism, rule-bending and hostility. Examining these dynamics on Twitch, in turn, provides a valuable window into how platform infrastructures and cultures generate norms and cultures of humour and amusement, and strengthens our understanding of online communities and platform power in this and similar contexts.","[Johnson, Mark R.] Univ Sydney, Digital Cultures, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of Sydney,"Johnson, MR (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Dept Media & Commun, John Woolley Bldg, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",markrjohnsongames@gmail.com,,"Johnson, Mark R/0000-0003-4622-650X",,,,,97,1,1,13,13,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,,,,,,,,,,,1.46144E+16,10.1177/14614448221095160,0,,44713,23,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,2B3HR,,,,,44885,WOS:000810083100001,0

High-speed broadband availability is associated with higher reported levels of home Internet access, greater frequency of Internet use and more engagement with Internet activities. Controlling for demographic and socio-economic circumstances, regression models show that quality of life is higher among daily users of the Internet. Little association is found with loneliness. Quality of life is higher among users of Internet-based communication applications such as email and video calls, and there is some evidence that loneliness may be less pronounced among users of these applications. The findings are consistent with the view that digital engagement can enhance the lives of older people and thus may be supportive of policies and interventions to address potential 'grey' digital divides.","[Mohan, Gretta] Econ & Social Res Inst, Whitaker Sq, Dublin 2 D02 K138, Ireland; Trinity Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland",Trinity College Dublin,"Mohan, G (corresponding author), Econ & Social Res Inst, Whitaker Sq, Dublin 2 D02 K138, Ireland.",Gretta.Mohan@esri.ie,,"Lyons, Sean/0000-0002-3526-6947; Mohan, Gretta/0000-0002-1525-0841","Electronic Communications Research Programme at the ESRI by the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications (DECC); Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg); Irish Life plc; Irish Government; Health Research Board [TILDA-2017-1]; Atlantic Philanthropies","Electronic Communications Research Programme at the ESRI by the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications (DECC); Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg); Irish Life plc; Irish Government; Health Research Board; Atlantic Philanthropies","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research is supported by the Electronic Communications Research Programme at the ESRI, funded as a joint research programme by the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications (DECC) and the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg).

We find support exchanges in this community can likely help women more efficiently and effectively cope with, and have more control over, the immediate stressor of infertility and associated uncertainty, which is profound given the lack of supportive resources they would otherwise have.","[Pearce, Katy E.] Univ Washington, Commun, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Donohoe, Dana] Univ Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Barta, Kristen] Univ Michigan, Sch Informat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Vitak, Jessica] Univ Maryland, Coll Informat Studies, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Pearce, KE (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Dept Commun, Box 353740, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",kepearce@uw.edu,; /V-2488-2018,"Pearce, Katy/0000-0002-3837-5305; /0000-0001-9362-9032",,,,,73,0,0,5,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,,,,,,,,,,,1.46144E+16,10.1177/14614448221097946,0,,44713,20,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,2B3IO,,,,,44885,WOS:000810085400001,0

Drawing on inductive thematic analysis based on 38 semi-structured interviews with Romanian investors, four major themes emerge: (1) unbreakable power of code encompasses rather libertarian discourses on potential state policies, (2) key role of peers explains the investments in the crypto market as a form of community membership, (3) assuming plenty of risks highlights the discourses focused on substantial and unpredictable gains, and (4) preferring safety above all encompasses discourses on financial stability through rather conservative behaviors.","[Obreja, Dragos M.] Univ Bucharest, Fac Sociol & Social Work, 90-92 Panduri Rd, Bucharest 050663, Romania",University of Bucharest,"Obreja, DM (corresponding author), Univ Bucharest, Fac Sociol & Social Work, 90-92 Panduri Rd, Bucharest 050663, Romania.",dragosm.obreja@gmail.com,"Obreja, Dragos/AAV-8141-2020","Obreja, Dragos/0000-0001-6146-8721",,,,,39,0,0,9,9,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,,,,,,,,,,,1.46144E+16,10.1177/14614448221092028,0,,44682,18,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,0Z9UT,,,,,44885,WOS:000791415000001,0

We analyze the individual browsing histories of two representative samples of German Internet users collected in 2012 (N = 2970) and 2018 (N = 2045) and find robust evidence for a smaller generational gap in online news use than commonly assumed. While short news website visits mostly demonstrated infrastructural factors, longer news use episodes were shaped more by preferences. The infrastructural role of social media corresponded with reduced news avoidance and more varied news repertoires.

This article examines this ambivalent bargain of economic rehabilitation in Singapore where Grab is headquartered. Drawing from historical records, it first traces the relations of platform to access, demonstrating how the framework of curative intermediaries had historically shaped expectations around work. Access in the 1980s was envisioned as intermediating infrastructural connections that could provide disabled people with resources, transforming them from liabilities to productive personhoods. The second portion draws from interviews with disabled delivery workers to highlight the problems that constitute this investment in intermediaries and cure. Although accommodative platforms provide some degree of economic inclusion, these accommodations are often partial, resulting in precarity, attrition, and injury. Curative platforms, therefore, signals the investment and twinning of cure and violence that subject the disabled to a compromised existence.","[Hong, Renyi] Natl Univ Singapore, Commun & Media, Singapore, Singapore",National University of Singapore,"Hong, RY (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Commun & New Media, Singapore, Singapore.",cnmhr@nus.edu.sg,,"Hong, Renyi/0000-0002-2126-0384",William Lim Siew Wai Fellowship,William Lim Siew Wai Fellowship,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research is supported by the William Lim Siew Wai Fellowship.",,68,0,0,2,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,,,,,,,,,,,1.46144E+16,10.1177/14614448221090638,0,,44652,21,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,0T0NC,,,,,44885,WOS:000786668700001,0

To provide a more nuanced assessment of agent governance, we introduce an analytical framework that distinguishes between different aspects and forms of governance. We then apply it to explore how agents are governed across nine platforms. Our observations show that despite acknowledging diverse roles of agents, platforms tend to focus on governing selected forms of their misuse. We also observe differences in governance approaches used by platforms, in particular when it comes to the agent rights/obligations and transparency of policing mechanisms. These observations highlight the necessity of advancing the algorithmic governance research agenda and developing a generalizable normative framework for agent governance.","[Makhortykh, Mykola] Univ Bern, Inst Commun & Media Studies, Bern, Switzerland; [Urman, Aleksandra] Univ Zurich, Social Comp Grp, Andreastr 15, CH-8050 Zurich, Switzerland; [Muench, Felix Victor; Heldt, Amelie; Kettemann, Matthias C.] Leibniz Inst Media Res, Hans Bredow Inst, Hamburg, Germany; [Dreyer, Stephan] Leibniz Inst Media Res, Hans Bredow Inst, Media Law & Media Governance, Hamburg, Germany; [Dreyer, Stephan] Leibniz Inst Media Res, Hans Bredow Inst, Res Programme Transformat Publ Commun, Hamburg, Germany",University of Bern; University of Zurich,"Urman, A (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Social Comp Grp, Andreastr 15, CH-8050 Zurich, Switzerland.",urman@ifi.uzh.ch,,"Urman, Aleksandra/0000-0003-3332-9294; Munch, Felix Victor/0000-0001-8808-6790; Makhortykh, Mykola/0000-0001-7143-5317",,,,,68,0,0,6,12,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,APR,2022,24,4,,,SI,,964,981,1.46144E+16,10.1177/14614448221079035,0,,44652,18,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,0K7YW,,"Green Published, hybrid",,,44885,WOS:000780801400001,0

Nine of the 14 included studies examined the effect of social media on parent-child communication, while the rest explored the effect on broader family relationships. Overall evidence is mixed, highlighting some aspects of social media use that may strengthen family connectedness, while others that may negatively impact meaningful interactions within families.

This study applies a method that disentangles the differential contributions of the individual characteristics to audience duplication networks. By analyzing a nationally representative survey about US adults' media use in 2019 (N = 12,043), we demonstrate that news fragmentation is driven by a myriad of individual factors, such as gender, race, and religiosity. Partisanship is still an important driver. We also distinguish between media exposure and media trust, showing that many cross-cutting ties in co-exposure networks disappear when media trust is considered. We conclude that audience fragmentation research should extend beyond ideological selectivity and additionally investigate how and why other individual-level preferences differentially contribute to fragmentation both in news exposure and in news trust.","[Peng, Yilang] Univ Georgia, Dept Financial Planning Housing & Consumer Econ, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Yang, Tian] Univ Penn, Annenberg Sch Commun, 3620 Walnut St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; University of Pennsylvania,"Yang, T (corresponding author), Univ Penn, Annenberg Sch Commun, 3620 Walnut St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",tian.yang@asc.upenn.edu,,"YANG, TIAN/0000-0003-2642-4760; /0000-0001-7711-9518",,,,,70,2,2,6,20,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,OCT,2022,24,10,,,,,2270,2290,1.46144E+15,10.1177/1461444821991559,0,,44228,21,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,4A4MW,,,,,44885,WOS:000624215900001,0

We map four basic forms of platform-mediated work against three variations of (in)visibility: (1) perceptible, (2) institutional, and (3) individual, and discuss the implications through the stories of three protagonists of platform workers. The suggested meta-analysis tool for understanding the mechanism of rendering platform workers obscure exposes who is recognized as a worker, what is recognized as work, and how these questions are negotiated in a platform-mediated digital space.

AR induced a greater sense of physical presence compared to the other modalities. The findings suggest that immersive properties of AR can contribute to journalism's goal of engaging the audience. However, AR was not a superior medium for informing the participants, and the viewing modality did not have an effect on the perceived authenticity of the visuals.

We aim to fill this gap and open a debate about the temporality of geomedia based on seven oral history interviews that we conducted with mobile media scholars who pioneered in research in mobile phones from late 1990s onwards.

Paying attention to their internal diversity and complex interactions, this article categorizes three types of repair practices, including the high-end approach employed by Samsung, Apple and Huawei, the mid-range approach adopted by the Chinese after-sales service provider Carlcare, and the low-end approach used by independent repairers. This article argues that Carlcare, as a rising repair actor, creates a middle ground between the elitism of big tech and the informality of local repair shops. Through its repair practice, Carlcare not only translates dysfunctional technologies into functional ones but also transforms informal laborers into professional technicians.

Through the interviews, we found that our participants understand cancel culture as more than just a mob engaged in public shaming on social media; it also involves perceptions of power imbalance and social justice. Building on these perspectives from our interviews, we tested the framework of theory of planned behavior in predicting intention to engage in cancel culture and expanded it by examining the effects of people's belief in a just world using an online national survey in Singapore. The analysis showed that attitude, subjective norms and perceived behavioral control were positively related to intention to engage in cancel culture, while general belief in a just world was a negative predictor.","[Tandoc, Edson C., Jr.; Ru, Beverly Tan Hui; Huei, Gabrielle Lee; Charlyn, Ng Min Qi; Chua, Rachel Angeline; Goh, Zhang Hao] Nanyang Technol Univ, Singapore, Singapore",Nanyang Technological University & National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore; Nanyang Technological University,"Tandoc, EC (corresponding author), Nanyang Technol Univ, Wee Kim Wee Sch Commun & Informat, 31 Nanyang Link, Singapore 637718, Singapore.",edson@ntu.edu.sg,,"Tandoc, Edson/0000-0002-8740-9313",Singapore Social Science Research Council [MOE2018-SSRTG-022],Singapore Social Science Research Council,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship and/or publication of this article: This research is supported by the Singapore Social Science Research Council via the corresponding author's SSRC Grant (MOE2018-SSRTG-022).",,44,0,0,30,37,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,,,,,,,,,,,1.46144E+16,10.1177/14614448221077977,0,,44621,19,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,ZS4AV,,,,,44885,WOS:000768410500001,0

Using an experiment, we find that user corrections of a meme containing false information reduced credibility assessments of the misinformation post and misperceptions but seeing misinformation also produced lower perceptions of personal news literacy and its value for society, regardless of whether it is corrected or not. Exposure to an NL message did not enhance the effectiveness of these corrective responses nor boost NL attitudes and may have generated cynicism.

Soon after, right-wing oppositional tweets were posted (n = 288) contesting the arguments of Turei and her supporters, and left-wing responses to those arguments (n = 214). Drawing on Mouffe's dissensual model, this article undertakes a close, qualitative analysis of those 502 tweets, in order to move towards a method for empirically distinguishing between antagonistic and agonistic tweets, identifying the latter as putting forward arguments which can be identified by the researcher and potentially engaged with by ideologically opposed adversaries.

Connections increased when users were active on the same pages whereas users' common location related to comparatively lower levels of commenting but not sharing activity. At the same time, while a larger proportion of them were male, users displayed a systematic tendency to interact with the other gender.

A part of this strategy is the video game industry's selective information disclosure, which I explore empirically on the example of telemetry infographics.

This article presents an ethnographic study in a school for young PWDs and highlights two observations. First, visual profiles on social media platforms could aggravate the social exclusion of young PWDs online and offline, marked by intra-disability and intersectional differences. Second, the co-presence afforded by digital media enabled young PWDs to resort to digital interactions in unwelcoming offline environments without changing the latter.

This article uses a new methodology to isolate the influence of outspokenness and responsiveness in shaping perceptions of polarization in online chat and face-to-face discussions. Text-based online and face-to-face discussions were reproduced in a face-to-face format (Study 1) and in a text-based chat format (Study 2). Uninformed observers (N = 102 and N = 103, repeated measures) evaluated these. The results showed that responsiveness was generally considered indicative of agreement and good social relationships but the interpretation of outspokenness (or lack of ambiguity) depended on the medium format. This suggests that what counts as diplomacy is not the same for each medium. Moreover, the experiences of the actors reproducing the chats in a face-to-face format highlighted the differences between media.

This study experimentally evaluated the possibility that Imgur users self-categorize and identify with an Imgur social identity, testing this hypothesis through the lens of in-group argumentation and attitudinal conformity. Specifically, this study presented persuasive messages to individuals reporting varying levels of Imgur identification and measured resulting attitudes, manipulating message context and the presence of message-reinforcing user comments. Findings support the proposition that users identify with the Imgur community, as high-identifiers exhibited greater message processing and normative attitude change when exposed to a persuasive message from an in-group source (i.e. another Imgur user) than low identifiers. These results further our understanding of contemporary social media use, contributing to a growing body of literature exploring online social identification and persuasive message processing.","[Hale, Brent J.] Univ Southern Mississippi, Commun Studies, Hattiesburg, MS 39406 USA",University of Southern Mississippi,"Hale, BJ (corresponding author), Univ Southern Mississippi, Sch Media & Commun, 118 Coll Dr, Hattiesburg, MS 39406 USA.",brent.hale@usm.edu,,,Indiana University Graduate School,Indiana University Graduate School,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the Indiana University Graduate School's Grant-in-Aid of Doctoral Research Award.",,51,0,0,14,14,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1177/14614448221124085,0,,44805,22,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,4V1QY,,,,,44885,WOS:000859260100001,0

Limited by the notion that 'security is only articulated in an institutional voice by the elites', the role of non-elite actors has remained understudied. Only recently has it been proposed that lay actors can become influential security agents through their online activity. However, social media's capacity to revert the top-down dynamics of securitization remains contended. To explore this puzzle and seeking to update the theory of securitization to the modern context of political communication, this study employs a semi-supervised machine learning approach to analyse a novel dataset of over 10 million Twitter messages by five elite and non-elite actor groups discussing the Amazon rainforest fires in 2019. Finally, the study uses vector autoregression (VAR) models to explore who leads and who echoes the securitization process. The results show that both elite and lay actors behave as security agents and demonstrate the methodological contribution offered by the text-as-data approach developed in this analysis.","[Umansky, Natalia] Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Polit & Int Relat, Dublin 4, Ireland",University College Dublin,"Umansky, N (corresponding author), Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Polit & Int Relat, Dublin 4, Ireland.",natalia.umansky@ucdconnect.ie,,"Umansky, Natalia/0000-0002-8059-5328",School of Politics and International Relations at University College Dublin under the Iseult Honohan scholarship,School of Politics and International Relations at University College Dublin under the Iseult Honohan scholarship,"The author disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship and/or publication of this article: Natalia Umansky received financial support from the School of Politics and International Relations at University College Dublin under the Iseult Honohan scholarship.",,90,0,0,12,12,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1177/14614448221111009,0,,44743,25,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,3F6DM,,hybrid,,,44885,WOS:000830757600001,0

A two-wave longitudinal survey was conducted among 354 AI voice assistant users across 2 months. Factor analysis results supported the conceptualization and operationalization of functional use and relational use of voice assistants. Results from the cross-lagged panel model confirmed that functional use and relational use reinforced themselves over time, respectively. Relational use increased subsequent functional use, and relational use reinforced itself through self-disclosure. Surprisingly, functional use did not increase subsequent relational use; instead, longitudinal mediation analysis showed that functional use reduced subsequent relational use due to the lack of self-disclosure. Furthermore, while self-disclosure increased subsequent privacy concerns, privacy concerns did not reduce subsequent self-disclosure.","[Xu, Shan] Texas Tech Univ, Coll Media & Commun, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA; [Li, Wenbo] Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Xu, S (corresponding author), Texas Tech Univ, Coll Media & Commun, Dept Publ Relat, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA.",shan.xu@ttu.edu,,"Li, Wenbo/0000-0003-0417-1758; Xu, Shan/0000-0002-2251-8682",,,,,63,1,1,28,28,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1177/14614448221108112,0,,44743,19,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,2Y3RY,,,,,44885,WOS:000825820000001,0

The network scam is therefore offered as a lens for understanding scams in the digital economy more broadly. As a case study, this article documents the 2017 Initial Coin Offering (ICO) Bubble. ICOs were supposed to be a new, radically disruptive way of crowdfunding to finance the development of a new, radically disruptive blockchain technological ecosystem. All told, ICOs raised an estimated $5 billion in 2017 alone. But by all analyses-both from observers and participants, both during the bubble and after-the vast majority of ICO turned out to be scams. This article uses these scams to theorize the network scam as a collaborative effort to bring about a shared future, but one that is fundamentally characterized by arbitrage on uneven belief among participants in that future ever coming to pass.","[Swartz, Lana] Univ Virginia, Media Studies, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA",University of Virginia,"Swartz, L (corresponding author), Univ Virginia, Wilson Hall, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA.",lanalana@gmail.com,,,,,,,59,0,0,1,1,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,JUL,2022,24,7,,,,,1695,1713,,10.1177/14614448221099224,0,,,19,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,3A7BM,,,,,44885,WOS:000827410900009,0

We offer a network analytical framework which relates producers' informal networks to their capacity to adopt digital innovations. Through a network ethnography of 4264 romance writers, we find that established authors who reversed traditional advice patterns, by seeking advice from inexperienced newcomers rather than experienced peers, were more likely to adopt digital self-publishing. By linking the concept of relational labor to network structures, we demonstrate the value of networking down in a digitally disrupted cultural industry-a surprising finding in a business where networking up, to powerful actors, has seemed critical for success. We argue that strategic relational labor by established content creators facilitates adaptation to digital conditions and provides some measure of protection against precarity in a changing landscape.","[Larson, Christine] Univ Colorado, Journalism, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Ready, Elspeth] Max Planck Inst Evolutionary Anthropol, Leipzig, Germany",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; Max Planck Society,"Larson, C (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, 1511 Univ Ave, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",Christine.larson@colorado.edu,,"LARSON, CHRISTINE/0000-0002-4171-809X",,,,,83,1,1,15,15,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,,,,,,,,,,,1.46144E+16,10.1177/14614448221090195,0,,44682,20,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,1J1FV,,,,,44885,WOS:000797671000001,0

Here, we empirically trace the ascent of a powerful constitutional metaphor currently employed in the news media discourse on platform governance: characterizations of Facebook's Oversight Board (OB) as a supreme court. We investigate the metaphor's descriptive suitability and question its normative and political ramifications. We argue that uncritical characterizations of the OB as Facebook's supreme court obscure its true scope and purpose.

This study aimed to address this gap by exploring Finnish pre-service teachers' conceptions and experiences of data agency in social media environments. Drawing from in-depth interviews of pre-service teachers (N = 14), the analysis revealed that pre-service teachers construct their data agency in terms of social frames and shared social norms, and they also recognize the lack of understanding regarding wider socio-technical systems within which data agencies are situated.

The findings show how platform pressures intertwine with content production, audience representation, journalistic values, and organizational development, thus manifesting the infrastructuralization and institutionalization of platforms in the media industry. While the interviewees articulated tensions related to adopting social media, the fieldwork data revealed forms of mimetic and normative isomorphism, mediated by platform data and professional roles in the organization. Moreover, the platform infrastructure seems to cultivate both critical and aspirational talk in the organization, which implies a more complex relationship beyond coercive platform power.","[Laaksonen, Salla-Maaria] Univ Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland; [Koivula, Minna; Villi, Mikko] Univ Jyvaskyla, Jyvaskyla, Finland",University of Helsinki; University of Jyvaskyla,"Laaksonen, SM (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Ctr Consumer Soc Res, Fac Social Sci, POB 16, Helsinki 00014, Finland.",salla.laaksonen@helsinki.fi,,"Villi, Mikko/0000-0001-6935-9386; Laaksonen, Salla-Maaria/0000-0003-3532-2387",Media Industry Research Foundation of Finland,Media Industry Research Foundation of Finland,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the Media Industry Research Foundation of Finland.",,56,0,0,8,8,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1177/14614448221122220,0,,44805,19,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,4K5YG,,"Green Published, hybrid",,,44885,WOS:000852024200001,0

We therefore conducted a systematic review of the evidence for associations between LB purchasing, PG and PVG. For LB/PG, 12 of 13 publications reported a positive relationship, with a moderately sized mean effect of r = .27. For LB/PVG, the mean effect was r = .40, although this finding was drawn from only six surveys in total. For PG/PVG, the mean effect was r = .21, with only 11 of 20 studies reporting significant effects. While further evidence is required to determine the direction of causality, the strength of relationships suggests that policy action on LBs may have benefits for harm minimisation.","Univ Plymouth, Fac Hlth, Appl Psychol & Appl Healthcare, Plymouth, Devon, England; Univ Plymouth, Fac Hlth, Sch Psychol, Plymouth, Devon, England; Univ Plymouth, Fac Hlth, PenARC NIHR Appl Res Collaborat, Plymouth, Devon, England; [Nicklin, Laura Louise] Univ Wolverhampton, Fac Educ Hlth & Wellbeing, Educ & Inclus Studies, Wolverhampton, England; [Uther, Maria] Univ Wolverhampton, Psychol, Wolverhampton, England; [Lloyd, Joanne] Univ Wolverhampton, Ctr Psychol Res, Cyberpsychol, Wolverhampton, England; [Lloyd, Joanne] Univ Wolverhampton, Ctr Psychol Res, Cyberpsychol Res Cluster, Wolverhampton, England; [Lloyd, Helen] Univ Plymouth, Psychol, Plymouth, Devon, England; [Close, James] Univ Plymouth, Fac Hlth, Hlth & Biomed Informat, Plymouth, Devon, England",University of Plymouth; University of Plymouth; University of Plymouth; University of Wolverhampton; University of Wolverhampton; University of Wolverhampton; University of Wolverhampton; University of Plymouth; University of Plymouth,"Spicer, SG (corresponding author), Univ Plymouth, NIHR ARC South West Peninsula, Sch Psychol, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England.",stuart.spicer@plymouth.ac.uk,"Uther, Maria/K-7899-2019","Uther, Maria/0000-0002-7948-302X; Spicer, Stuart/0000-0001-7585-8886; Lloyd, Joanne/0000-0003-3891-7247; Nicklin, Laura Louise/0000-0002-6195-9501",charity GambleAware,charity GambleAware,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by funding from the charity GambleAware.",,95,10,10,11,27,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,APR,2022,24,4,,,SI,,1001,1022,1.46144E+16,10.1177/14614448211027175,0,,44378,22,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,0K7YW,,"Green Accepted, Green Published",,,44885,WOS:000675645400001,0

Reviewing it later, the authors realised that this parallel thread illustrates perfectly the challenges researching 4chan - and similar - communities. We conducted discourse analysis on this unique dataset, providing an alternative perspective to predominant anthropological and informatic approaches. Our analysis enhances understanding of 'free-extremist' communities such as 4chan in several ways. It assesses how the /pol/ community responds to observation and provides new insights into roles influencers might have in radicalising others. It illustrates the value of discourse analysis in evaluating users' associations with the Alt-Right.

Results suggest that senior citizens are uniquely vulnerable to misinformation as the victims, in that they are less likely to check on suspicious content and that they are also less motivated to share information online in general. In contrast, youngadults have a greater propensity to be the spreaders of misinformation if not made suspicious of the content due to their stronger motivations to share information online. FoMO and digital literacy significantly mediate the relationship between age and motivations to share information and the one between age and reactions to misinformation, respectively.

Coverage was differentiated by partisanship, whereby left-leaning media focused more on ethical problems associated with the technology compared to their right-leaning peers who highlighted its abuses by foreign governments. Right-leaning media also referred more to technology's positive uses, such as helping law enforcement, compared to left-leaning media.

Using a qualitative multi-method approach, we investigated how personal characteristics, the presentation form, and content-related characteristics influence social media users' perceptions of hate speech, which we differentiated as first-level (i.e. recognizing hate speech) and second-level perceptions (i.e. attitude toward it). To that end, we first observed 23 German-speaking social media users as they scrolled through a fictitious social media feed featuring hate speech. Next, we conducted remote self-confrontation interviews to discuss the content and semi-structured interviews involving interactive tasks. Although it became apparent that perceptions are highly individual, some overarching tendencies emerged. The results suggest that the perception of and indignation toward hate speech decreases as social media use increases. Moreover, direct and prosecutable hate speech is perceived as being particularly negative, especially in visual presentation form.","[Schmid, Ursula Kristin; Rieger, Diana] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Media & Commun, Oettingenstr 67, D-80538 Munich, Germany; [Kuempel, Anna Sophie] Tech Univ Dresden, Digital Media & Methods, Dresden, Germany",University of Munich; Technische Universitat Dresden,"Schmid, UK (corresponding author), Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Media & Commun, Oettingenstr 67, D-80538 Munich, Germany.",ursula.schmid@ifkw.lmu.de; anna.kuempel@tu-dresden.de; diana.rieger@ifkw.lmu.de,,"Schmid, Ursula Kristin/0000-0002-1892-002X; Kumpel, Anna Sophie/0000-0001-7184-4057; Rieger, Diana/0000-0002-2417-0480",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) [13N15340],German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) under grant number 13N15340 (KISTRA project).",,51,1,1,11,15,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,,,,,,,,,,,1.46144E+16,10.1177/14614448221091185,0,,44682,19,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,0Z9UV,,hybrid,,,44885,WOS:000791415200001,0

The conceptual analysis reveals interdependencies and tensions between ethical principles, which advocate the need of a basic understanding of AI inputs, functioning, agency, and outcomes.

The argument is grounded in interviews with UK public sector office workers self-tracking sitting time that featured the following three themes: (1) the participants related their sitting to deteriorated work conditions after government austerity politics and redundancies, (2) the pressurised rhythm of work made it difficult to reduce sitting time and fostered a sense of discontent and powerlessness and (3) the workers did not self-track in their free time, defined as free from monitoring.

Despite German-speaking countries offering a variety of populist parties, existing automated approaches are rarely applicable to German texts. Furthermore, they are not tailored to social media and often focus only on anti-elitism. I vastly improved existing dictionaries by analyzing populist ideology in its entirety, including people-centrism and the demand for people's sovereignty. The article showed how known populist parties in Austria, Germany, and Switzerland spread these messages to a great extent on social media.

It does this by using Vedder's conceptual categories of privacy to identify and position parents' and teenagers' concepts of privacy within interpersonal, institutional and commercial data terrains. Drawing from qualitative interviews, the analysis shows that parents' and teenagers' conceptualise privacy in terms of the private/public dimension and that their conceptualisations of the consumer-corporate relationship, and corporations themselves, prohibited any concern for their decisional and informational privacy. As their conceptualisations of privacy harms were embedded within social rather than technological frames, this precluded motivation to protect children's data privacy. This research argues that without a conceptual shift in the way we think about privacy and privacy harms, we need to question whether the logics of neoliberalism can effectively address children's data privacy.","[Keen, Caroline] Social Res NZ, 91 Centreway Rd, Auckland 0931, New Zealand",,"Keen, C (corresponding author), Social Res NZ, 91 Centreway Rd, Auckland 0931, New Zealand.",keenresearch@gmail.com,,,InternetNZ,InternetNZ,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Thank you to InternetNZ for providing a research grant to the author.",,41,3,3,4,29,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,JAN,2022,24,1,,,,,50,69,1.46144E+15,10.1177/1461444820960068,0,,44075,20,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,YE4EL,,,,,44885,WOS:000573247900001,0

While the majority of work within geomedia studies focuses on contemporary developments, thereby offering snapshots of geomediatization processes as these currently manifest themselves, this volume wants to address the nexus of geography and media from a decidedly historical perspective. Doing so, we hope to inspire a historical turn in geomedia studies as well as contribute to the ongoing discussion about how to define geomedia (studies) beyond (the study of) particular technologies or media genres. By boldly uprooting the geomedia concept from its contemporary, predominantly digital, framework, the contributions gathered here encourage us to map the trajectories of geomedia, to challenge geomediatization realism, to remedy epistemological biases, and to further articulate the postdigital.","[Fast, Karin] Karlstad Univ, Ctr Geomedia Studies, Karlstad, Sweden; [Abend, Pablo] Burg Giebichenstein Univ Art & Design Halle, Design theory, Halle, Germany",Karlstad University,"Fast, K (corresponding author), Karlstad Univ, Universitsgatan 2, S-65188 Karlstad, Sweden.",karin.fast@kau.se,,,,,,,40,0,0,4,4,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,NOV,2022,24,11,,,SI,,2385,2395,,10.1177/14614448221122168,0,,,11,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,5D7FH,,"hybrid, Green Published",,,44885,WOS:000865102100001,0

A dystopian view saw the rapid development and proliferation of COVID-19 contact-tracing apps as a vanguard technology for surveillance. Expediently deployed as a technological fix to the pandemic, contact-tracing was seen to threaten to transform a state of emergency into a state of exception, under which accepted or constitutional laws and norms might be suspended. Here, we extend early critiques of the contact-tracing app as a 'technofix' to argue the growing intervention of global technology corporations in digital governance and affairs of national sovereignty throughout the COVID-19 pandemic represents a new frontier of state-industrial surveillance that exploits people's pre-investment in and dependence on technology corporations. We exemplify this with the 'technofix' of the Google-Apple Exposure Notification (GAEN) framework and critically examine the notion of a decentralised and privacy-preserving Bluetooth-based contact-tracing framework proposed by global technology corporations that may threaten state sovereignty when determining public health responses to current or future crises.","[Mann, Monique] Deakin Univ, Criminol, Geelong, Vic, Australia; [Mann, Monique] Deakin Univ, Alfred Deakin Inst Citizenship & Globalisat, Geelong, Vic, Australia; [Mitchell, Peta] Queensland Univ Technol QUT, Digital Media, Sch Commun, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Mitchell, Peta; Foth, Marcus] Queensland Univ Technol QUT, Digital Media Res Ctr, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Foth, Marcus] Queensland Univ Technol QUT, Urban Informat, QUT Design Lab, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",Deakin University; Deakin University; Queensland University of Technology (QUT); Queensland University of Technology (QUT); Queensland University of Technology (QUT),"Mann, M (corresponding author), Deakin Univ, Geelong Waurn Ponds Campus,75 Pigdons Rd, Geelong, Vic 3216, Australia.",monique.mann@deakin.edu.au,"; Foth, Marcus/I-9914-2012","Mitchell, Peta/0000-0003-4523-6685; Foth, Marcus/0000-0001-9892-0208",,,,,77,0,0,8,8,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1177/14614448221109800,0,,44743,19,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,3F6EU,,,,,44885,WOS:000830761000001,0

While the scientific community has recently started to take an interest in this new phenomenon, it still remains mostly unclear how online audiences engage with-and relate to-these artificial digital creations. To address the identified research gap, we conducted a preregistered experiment (N = 179), comparing viewers' parasocial interactions (PSIs) with either a human or a virtual influencer. Based on natural stimuli, we find that viewers' parasocial response does not differ significantly between the two groups. However, by focusing on several theoretically relevant mediator variables, we uncover two opposing effects at play: While a significant direct effect signifies stronger PSIs with the virtual influencer, participants also attribute this persona with less mental human-likeness and similarity to themselves-which ultimately suppresses the observed advantage.

Shared traffic data were retrieved from comScore's Media Metrix Multi-Platform database. The empirical results of the separable temporal exponential random graph model (STERGM) confirm that preferential attachment, audience size, and niche width significantly drive the likelihood of tie formation and dissolution in the evolving audience duplication network. These effects hold true even when other endogenous structural features and exogenous nodal attributes are taken into account.

Here we revisit this topic through a study of YouTube drama, a hybrid genre where creators provide commentary on the scandals, scams, and feuds between YouTube celebrities. Drawing on cultural studies scholarship, and based on qualitative interviews and content analysis, we argue that YouTube drama embodies a range of cultural and moral negotiations that take place on social media platforms. We conceptualize accountability practices on YouTube as an ongoing platform drama in which creators engage in perpetual and highly visible power struggles with celebrities, audiences, legacy media, other creators, and YouTube itself. Within the context of this platform drama, structural issues and interpersonal conflicts become blurred, as do accountability practices and monetized spectacles. We analyze cancelation on YouTube as a ritualistic practice in which structural tensions are publicly negotiated and performed, even as accountability itself remains largely elusive.","[Lewis, Rebecca; Christin, Angele] Stanford Univ, Dept Commun, 450 Serra Mall Bldg 120,Room 110, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University,"Lewis, R (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Commun, 450 Serra Mall Bldg 120,Room 110, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",beccalew@stanford.edu,,,Stanford Graduate Fellowship; Sorbonne Universite-Paris Institute for Advanced Study Chair on Major Social Changes; Social Media Collective at Microsoft Research New England,Stanford Graduate Fellowship(Stanford University); Sorbonne Universite-Paris Institute for Advanced Study Chair on Major Social Changes; Social Media Collective at Microsoft Research New England(Microsoft),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The first author received funding from a Stanford Graduate Fellowship; the second author received funding from the Sorbonne Universite-Paris Institute for Advanced Study Chair on Major Social Changes, as well as the Social Media Collective at Microsoft Research New England.

Although research has examined why people discontinue these devices, less explores what actually happens when people unplug. This article addresses this gap by considering the embodied and habitual dimensions of self-tracking and discontinuance. We consider the potential for digital data - and their unanticipated affects - to linger within habitual practices even after the device is abandoned. We draw on the philosophies of Felix Ravaisson and Gilles Deleuze to understand habit as a capacity for change, rather than a performance of sameness. We trace how self-tracking prompts new embodiments that continue to unfold even after people disengage. In decentring the device as our object of attention, we trouble the logic that self-tracking simply 'stops' in its absence. This holds implications for theorizing human-digital relations and for how self-tracking health interventions are implemented and evaluated.","[Clark, Marianne; Southerton, Clare] Univ New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Driller, Matthew] La Trobe Univ, Sport & Exercise, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney; La Trobe University,"Clark, M (corresponding author), Univ New South Wales, Ctr Social Res Hlth, Vital Lab, John Goodsell Bldg, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.;Clark, M (corresponding author), Univ New South Wales, Social Policy Res Ctr, John Goodsell Bldg, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",Marianne.clark@unsw.edu.au,"Southerton, Clare/AAC-2485-2019; Driller, Matthew/J-8323-2014","Southerton, Clare/0000-0002-5812-9785; Driller, Matthew/0000-0002-9990-8830",University of Waikato,University of Waikato,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was supported by a University of Waikato strategic funding postdoctoral fellowship.",,61,1,1,11,13,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,,,,,,,,,,,1.46144E+16,10.1177/14614448221083992,0,,44621,21,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,ZZ7PL,,,,,44885,WOS:000773456100001,0

However, these studies tend not to capture the moment when these restrictions are implemented and citizens experience a high level of uncertainty. Addressing the implementation of a national security law (NSL) in Hong Kong, we used two-wave panel data to understand political engagement on Facebook before and shortly after the law was enacted. We find a serial mediation path in which pan-democratic and localist users (those who tend to oppose the government) showed greater fear of the law; this encouraged more active privacy management which was related to a higher level of engagement after the enactment of NSL, implying that these users responded strategically through restricting the visibility of their engagement.

A closer examination of the Facebook Live content showed that while in-studio content featuring radio announcers in their traditional setup did not solicit followers' likes, Facebook Live posts that featured out-of-studio locations gained more approval in 2018. These findings show how technological-algorithmic platforms are leveraged by radio stations, even if they are not endorsed by social media users.

Such 'meme tracing' is specifically pertinent to the study of anonymous imageboards like 4chan, where inquiry cannot be easily based on the individual. Drawing from actor-network theory, I argue 'panoramic memes' - memes that repeatedly paint a totalising picture of a collective - are especially useful to identify what narratives hold such anonymous groups together. To operationalise this, I conducted a qualitative-quantitative case study of '/ourguy/': a meme used to suggest a certain public figure is representative of the beliefs of an entire group. Using text mining methods, I traced this term to the names of public figures on 4chan's far-right /pol/ board. This reveals that Donald Trump and Robert Mueller were most commonly proposed as an '/ourguy/' between 2016 and 2020, while the meme was entangled with conspiracy creation and far-right mobilisation.","[Hagen, Sal] Univ Amsterdam, Dept Media Studies, Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam,"Hagen, S (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Turfdraagsterpad 9, NL-1012 XT Amsterdam, Noord Holland, Netherlands.",s.h.hagen@uva.nl,,"Hagen, Sal/0000-0002-1669-2377",Dutch Research Council (NWO),Dutch Research Council (NWO)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The author has received PhD in the Humanities grant from the Dutch Research Council (NWO).",,68,0,0,6,15,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,,,,,,,,,,,1.46144E+16,10.1177/14614448221078274,0,,44593,21,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,ZF5OE,,hybrid,,,44885,WOS:000759616300001,0

There is also an indirect relationship between being aware of the technology and its usage through how-to knowledge accumulation. This study is the first attempt to understand the role of knowledge accumulation in the global usage of Tor. The findings provide insights into the worldwide concerns of online privacy and Dark Web regulation.","[Chen, Zhicong; Liu, Xiao Fan] City Univ Hong Kong, Web Min Lab, Dept Media & Commun, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Jardine, Eric] Virginia Tech, Polit Sci, Blacksburg, VA USA; [Zhu, Jonathan J.

Results show significant differences in skills by mode of access. People who became hybrid users (mobile and computer) by wave 2 significantly gained skills while those who were hybrid and became mobile-only by wave 2 significantly lost abilities. People who did not change their type of access did not change their level of digital skills, despite the past of time and gained experience using the Internet.

Furthermore, by analyzing Facebook commentary of the performance, we trace its communicative outcomes: support and legitimization, but also problematization and delegitimization. Our results highlight the unpredictable and ambivalent nature of humor in facilitating a political protest.

Using this tension, this essay engages visual content analysis and critical technocultural discourse analysis to examine the innovative ways marginalized creators employ TikTok's various medium and technological affordances to evade algorithmic surveillance and oppression. Building on Simone Browne's concept of dark sousveillance, I theorize these practices as acts of digital dark sousveillance, defined within the essay as the use of digital tools to enact surveillance subversion, obfuscation, inversion while operating within systems of racializing surveillance.","[Peterson-Salahuddin, Chelsea] Northwestern Univ, Media Technol & Soc, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Northwestern University,"Peterson-Salahuddin, C (corresponding author), Northwestern Univ, 2240 Campus Dr, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",chelseapeterson-salahuddin2022@u.northwestern.edu,,"Peterson-Salahuddin, Chelsea/0000-0001-7006-3259",,,,,53,0,0,16,24,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,,,,,,,,,,,1.46144E+16,10.1177/14614448221080480,0,,44652,20,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,0J5JX,,,,,44885,WOS:000780141700001,0

Based on this framework, I describe three different contexts of economic transaction: the Steam Game Store, the Steam Community Workshop and the Steam Community Market. I analyse how the approximately 46,500 game titles published on the platform are distributed across these contexts and how these games can be ranked with regard to current player numbers, and discuss Valve's position as combined platform owner, game developer and game publisher.","[Thorhauge, Anne Mette] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Commun, Karen Blixens Pl 8, DK-2300 Copenhagen S, Denmark; [Thorhauge, Anne Mette] Danish Media Council Children & Young People, Aarhus, Denmark",University of Copenhagen,"Thorhauge, AM (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Dept Commun, Karen Blixens Pl 8, DK-2300 Copenhagen S, Denmark.",thorhaug@hum.ku.dk,"Thorhauge, Anne Mette/ABE-2281-2020","Thorhauge, Anne Mette/0000-0002-5100-5587",,,,,34,0,0,10,15,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,,,,,,,,,,,1.46144E+16,10.1177/14614448221081401,0,,44621,21,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,ZS4AT,,,,,44885,WOS:000768410300001,0

The case study illuminates how the Lovelace effect can be facilitated through technical but also through representational means, such as the situations and cultural contexts in which users are invited to interact with the AI.","[Natale, Simone] Univ Turin, Media Hist & Theory, Turin, Italy; [Natale, Simone] Loughborough Univ, Loughborough, Leics, England; [Henrickson, Leah] Univ Leeds, Digital Media, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",University of Turin; Loughborough University; University of Leeds,"Natale, S (corresponding author), Univ Turin, Dept Humanities, Via St Ottavio 20, I-10124 Turin, Italy.",simone.natale@unito.it,,"Henrickson, Leah/0000-0001-8008-2373; Natale, Simone/0000-0003-1962-2398",,,,,79,0,0,2,8,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,,,,,,,,,,,1.46144E+16,10.1177/14614448221077278,0,,44621,18,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,ZN9VM,,Green Accepted,,,44885,WOS:000765377900001,0

Current conceptions of media literacy are frequently based on mass media, focusing on the analysis of common content and evaluation of the content using common values. This article initiates a new conceptual framework of social media literacy (SoMeLit). Moving away from the mass media-based assumptions of extant approaches, SoMeLit centers on the user's self in social media that is in dynamic causation with their choices of messages and networks. The foci of analysis in SoMeLit, therefore, are one's selections and values that influence and are influenced by the construction of one's reality on social media; and the evolving characteristics of social media platforms that set the boundaries of one's social media reality construction. Implications of the new components and dimensions of SoMeLit for future research, education, and action are discussed.","[Cho, Hyunyi; Lopez, Rachel; Li, Wenbo] Ohio State Univ, Sch Commun, 154 N Oval Mall, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Cannon, Julie] Cornell Univ, Dept Commun, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; Cornell University,"Cho, H (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Sch Commun, 154 N Oval Mall, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",cho.919@osu.edu,,"Cho, Hyunyi/0000-0003-0980-0146",National Institutes of Health [R01CA176196],National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study was supported in part by grant R01CA176196 from the National Institutes of Health.

Individually, there might be trade-offs between those genres, especially entertainment versus news. This study analyzed a large user engagement dataset (similar to 40,000 users' comments) collected from the Chinese information application Toutiao, one of the most popular information distribution platforms in China. The results showed that (I) the commenters were not fragmented between content genres, and (2) the users' news engagement was positively associated with their entertainment engagement. The findings indicate that the availability of high media choices will not reduce the news engagement of those who have strong interest in entertainment. Instead, news engagement might increase alongside the augmentation of the sum of information engagement. Finally, we discussed the differences between relative news engagement and absolute news engagement.","[Huang, Shengchun; Yang, Tian] Univ Penn, Annenberg Sch Commun, 3620 Walnut St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania,"Huang, SC (corresponding author), Univ Penn, Annenberg Sch Commun, 3620 Walnut St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",shengchun.huang@asc.upenn.edu,,"Huang, Shengchun/0000-0001-6581-3625; YANG, TIAN/0000-0003-2642-4760",,,,,55,1,1,9,16,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1177/14614448211063899,0,,44562,22,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,YP9SB,,,,,44885,WOS:000748958600001,0

Thunberg started out with no resources, a child of 15 with limited experience and a history of Asperger's. Thunberg's iconic performance seems to have been able to turn these weaknesses into strengths. To understand how this happened, we must situate her analysis within the social media ecology. Two things distinguish this environment from previous phases: iconic protagonists now have wide degrees of control over their own performance, and audiences are no longer mere receptors of iconic performance, but active co-performers. Greta Thunberg is one of the first major political icons to have been fully formed within the new social media ecology.

SS can be regarded as a starting point to the era of electrotechnological navigation, and is of media-historical interest insofar as its operability was based on undersea acoustics: shifting its epistemic focus from sight to sound, SS thus lay beyond the visual regime that characterizes our current digital geomedia cultures. Herein, I will reconstruct the genesis and history of SS, use it as a contrasting foil to our postmodern geomedia practices, and finally argue for an understanding of geomedia as historically variable phenomena.","[Borbach, Christoph] Univ Siegen, Chair Sci Technol & Media Studies, Siegen, Germany",Universitat Siegen,"Borbach, C (corresponding author), Univ Siegen, D-57072 Siegen, Germany.",christoph.borbach@uni-siegen.de,,"Borbach, Christoph/0000-0002-6184-7278","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) [190576466 - GRK 1769]","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation)(German Research Foundation (DFG))","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) -Project-ID 190576466 -GRK 1769: Locating Media.",,51,0,0,1,1,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,NOV,2022,24,11,,,SI,,2493,2513,,10.1177/14614448221122240,0,,,21,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,5D7FH,,hybrid,,,44885,WOS:000865102100006,0

I argue that the data-driven decision-making enabled by urban computing constitutes a critical threshold in terms of who is able to speak with authority about the city.

This article develops the notion of digital care work based on 18 book-chapter-length essays by active librarians based at Swedish public libraries. It illustrates that librarians are central to the process of translating digitalization into reality; they have become ambassadors of digitalization not only by fostering digital skills and competences in workshops and official training sessions but also, we argue, through a specific form of digital work, namely, digital care work. This kind of gendered work, which is typically carried out alongside the official tasks and assignments of librarians, is of low prestige and often involves affective aspects, such as emotions of shame and uncertainty.","[Kaun, Anne; Forsman, Michael] Sodertorn Univ, Dept Media & Commun Studies, Huddinge, Sweden",Sodertorn University,"Kaun, A (corresponding author), Sodertorn Univ, Sch Culture & Educ, Media & Commun Studies, Alfred Nobels Alle 13, S-14189 Huddinge, Sweden.",Anne.kaun@sh.se,,"Kaun, Anne/0000-0002-5879-2130",,,,,51,0,0,4,4,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,,,,,,,,,,,1.46144E+16,10.1177/14614448221104234,0,,44713,16,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,2I3NQ,,,,,44885,WOS:000814889500001,0

Selective exposure research assumes that psychological biases cause people to turn to attitude-reinforcing disinformation, though studies indicate that this only holds true for small niches of online audiences. However, when online, unbiased users as well may encounter disinformation, which for them appear to be attitude-challenging. How unbiased online users experience and cope with dissonance triggered by this, and whether this affects their pre-existing attitudes, has hardly been explored. This research gap is addressed using the polarized topic of climate change as an example. An experimental research design is applied combining stimulus exposure, survey research, eye tracking, and interviews (n = 50). The findings indicate that unbiased users are not entirely resistant to disinformation influence. However, attitude effects could not be fully explained by selection behavior but instead through different feelings and strategies of coping with dissonance and patterns of performing online information searches.","[Wolff, Laura] Tech Univ Carolo Wilhelmina Braunschweig, Inst Commun Sci, Bienroder Weg 97, D-38106 Braunschweig, Germany; [Taddicken, Monika] Tech Univ Carolo Wilhelmina Braunschweig, Commun Sci, Braunschweig, Germany",Braunschweig University of Technology; Braunschweig University of Technology,"Wolff, L (corresponding author), Tech Univ Carolo Wilhelmina Braunschweig, Inst Commun Sci, Bienroder Weg 97, D-38106 Braunschweig, Germany.",laura.wolff@tu-braunschweig.de,,,,,,,50,0,0,9,9,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,,,,,,,,,,,1.46144E+16,10.1177/14614448221090194,0,,44682,22,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,1M1ZS,,,,,44885,WOS:000799774600001,0

These users' agency-based choices are impacted by constant able-bodied surveillance and disciplining, especially when it comes to dis/ability visibility and potential context collapse. This paper develops the concept of disability performance within social media studies, presenting a qualitative study of social media users with concealable communicative disabilities: autistics, hard-of-hearing and people who stutter. Four factors were found to shape users' dis/ability performances: the use of social media interfaces for the compartmentalization of disabled identity; users' continuous efforts to make their social environment inclusionary; the centrality of users' disabled identity and intersectionality; and the design of the performance's message. Together, these show disability performances to be deliberate expressions of agency on the part of vulnerable social media users, who perform dis/ability according to their own evaluation of authenticity to increase their social inclusion.","[Bitman, Nomy] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Commun & Journalism, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel",Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"Bitman, N (corresponding author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Commun & Journalism, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel.",Nomy.Bitman@mail.huji.ac.il,,"Bitman, Nomy/0000-0001-8325-0459",Levtsion scholarship - The Hebrew University of Jerusalem; Israeli Council for Higher Education,Levtsion scholarship - The Hebrew University of Jerusalem; Israeli Council for Higher Education,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was supported by Levtsion scholarship - The Hebrew University of Jerusalem and The Israeli Council for Higher Education.",,59,0,0,17,31,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,FEB,2022,24,2,,,SI,,401,419,,10.1177/14614448211063183,0,,,19,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,YX7ZK,,,,,44885,WOS:000754316300008,0

These narratives leverage Instagram's affordances of visuality, scalability, and interactivity and combine social media branding practices with framing to recount the past so as to serve the diaspora Armenians' present and future needs of genocide recognition and reparations.

In this study, we used theories of performance and digital personhood to explore how LGBTQ+ students use social media for identity management. We report a thematic analysis of 16 interviews. Four themes were generated from the data, showing that students use social media to explore, conceal, protect and express their identities. We found that different social media provide stages where LGBTQ+ identities are constrained by different and distinctive social factors. Thus, LGBTQ+ students' online identities are multiple, situated and bound to specific platforms, with some alternatives to Facebook offering a space where students may feel more comfortable performing their authentic selves.","[Talbot, Catherine, V] Northumbria Univ, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England; [Talbot, Catherine, V] Bournemouth Univ, Psychol, Poole, Dorset, England; [Talbot, Amelia] Univ Oxford, Oxford, England; [Roe, Danielle J.] Univ Birmingham, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Briggs, Pam] Northumbria Univ, Appl Psychol, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England",Northumbria University; Bournemouth University; University of Oxford; University of Birmingham; Northumbria University,"Talbot, CV (corresponding author), Bournemouth Univ, Fac Sci & Technol, Dept Psychol, Poole BH12 5BB, Dorset, England.",ctalbot@bournemouth.ac.uk,"Talbot, Amelia/AAI-3348-2021; Roe, Danielle/ABC-2451-2021; Roe, Danielle/AAQ-3479-2021; Briggs, Pam/GPG-2147-2022","Talbot, Amelia/0000-0002-6892-5419; Roe, Danielle/0000-0003-4190-3540; Briggs, Pam/0000-0001-5028-4601; Talbot, Catherine/0000-0001-9353-8990",EPSRC [EP/M023001/1],EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship and/or publication of this article: This work was funded by the EPSRC Grant EP/M023001/1.

By reading traces of and as geomedia in different natural elements, the thick mappings of lines presented in this article render the properties of the crossed environments visible. From a historical-anthropological perspective, geomedia have taken on a double perspective in this process since the late 18th century, with the first aerial images. With regard to the movement in the air, on land, and on water, this double mediality concerns the paradox of representing an in situ perspective and simultaneously a line of becoming. Geomedia always exhibit a documentary and a procedural form. These two characteristics are chiasmically linked with each since the Industrial Revolution. Geomedia are practices that reflexively demonstrate how the paradox can be visualized, namely, that a mediated human body on the move is in a stable position, while the surroundings are fluid.","[Thielmann, Tristan] Univ Siegen, Sci Technol & Media Studies, Siegen, Germany",Universitat Siegen,"Thielmann, T (corresponding author), Univ Siegen, Herrengarten 3, D-57072 Siegen, Germany.",tristan.thielmann@uni-siegen.de,,,"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) [262513311-SFB 1187]","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation)(German Research Foundation (DFG))","The author disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation)-Project-ID 262513311-SFB 1187.",,67,0,0,0,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,NOV,2022,24,11,,,SI,,2438,2467,,10.1177/14614448221122190,0,,,30,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,5D7FH,,,,,44885,WOS:000865102100004,0

However, our insight into how users construe their sense of personal responsibility and expectations of other users remains limited. By theoretically foregrounding user perspective, this study investigates the boundaries and nuances of user responsibility to intervene against incivility. Empirically, it draws on 20 qualitative vignette interviews with young people in Germany. The findings show that as contexts collapse in users' newsfeeds, the imagined boundaries of personal public spheres and own social relationships with uncivil users serve as heuristics for hierarchizing and delimiting personal responsibility to intervene. Beyond abstract individual responsibility for the public discourse, practical responsibility is distributed among personal public spheres.","[Gagrcin, Emilija] Free Univ Berlin, Berlin, Germany",Free University of Berlin,"Gagrcin, E (corresponding author), Free Univ Berlin, Inst Publizist & Kommunikat Wissensch, Garystr 55, D-14165 Berlin, Germany.",emilija.gagrcin@fu-berlin.de,,"Gagrcin, Emilija/0000-0002-2953-1871",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research [16DII114],German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research, grant number 16DII114.",,80,0,0,11,11,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1177/14614448221117499,0,,44774,18,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,3W9OJ,,hybrid,,,44885,WOS:000842677700001,0

Therefore, we conducted a 15-month ethnographic study among ethno-religious minority youths in which we investigated networked gift-giving practices. We stress the notion of networked because the results illustrate how these young people appropriate the amplified visibility of their relational maintenance behaviors on social media in order to negotiate status and social ties.

Identity biopolitics exploits a positive feedback loop between targeting and content: the sociocultural differentiations liberalism declares politically irrelevant are used to target content that cultivates awareness of subjects' particular depoliticized disadvantage within the prevailing liberal order. The antiliberal populist exploits this condition to drive support for their political program.

Beyond the dominant focus on informational trust and its country-specific articulations, trustworthiness evaluations can relate to the materiality of news and its global manifestations. Especially in digital algorithmic environments, understanding news trustworthiness requires a holistic approach, which combines informational and socio-technical aspects while addressing both institutional and interpersonal trust. Drawing on 488 in-depth interviews with media consumers in Argentina, Finland, Israel, Japan, and the United States, this article investigates news (dis)trust from the lens of socio-materiality. The six trust-oriented affordances we identified-selectivity, interactivity, customization, searchability, information abundance, and immediacy-reveal important socio-technical commonalities that underlie news trust across countries. These affordances, moreover, point to an interplay of trust and self-agency. Taken together, the findings illuminate the lived experience of news trust as manifested across cultures and offer a broader understanding of trustworthiness within current media ecology.","[Aharoni, Tali; Tenenboim-Weinblatt, Keren] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Commun & Journalism, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel; [Kligler-Vilenchik, Neta] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Commun, Jerusalem, Israel; [Boczkowski, Pablo] Northwestern Univ, Dept Commun Studies, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Hayashi, Kaori] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Interdisciplinary Informat Studies, Media & Journalism Studies, Tokyo, Japan; [Mitchelstein, Eugenia] Univ San Andres, Dept Social Sci, Victoria, Argentina; [Villi, Mikko] Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Language & Commun Studies, Journalism, Jyvaskyla, Finland",Hebrew University of Jerusalem; Hebrew University of Jerusalem; Northwestern University; University of Tokyo; Universidad de San Andres Argentina; University of Jyvaskyla,"Aharoni, T (corresponding author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Commun & Journalism, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel.",tali.aharoni@mail.huji.ac.il,,"Kligler-Vilenchik, Neta/0000-0003-3470-3305; Aharoni, Tali/0000-0002-2138-8329; Villi, Mikko/0000-0001-6935-9386",Helsingin Sanomat Foundation; JSPS KAKENHI [17H01833]; Global Partnership Fund of the Buffett Institute for Global Studies at Northwestern University,"Helsingin Sanomat Foundation; JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Global Partnership Fund of the Buffett Institute for Global Studies at Northwestern University","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the Helsingin Sanomat Foundation, JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number 17H01833, and the Global Partnership Fund of the Buffett Institute for Global Studies at Northwestern University.",,54,0,0,8,8,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,,,,,,,,,,,1.46144E+16,10.1177/14614448221096334,0,,44713,19,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,2B3JK,,,,,44885,WOS:000810087600001,0

Since algorithmic figures are generated by a bundle of heterogeneous contexts, their emergence leads to conflicting visions about the reality, materiality and effects of algorithmisation. This article provides four ethnographic strategies to describe the contexts of production and circulation of algorithmic figures: observing the observers of algorithms; mapping and creating algorithmic figures; drawing relations across contexts of figuring; and analysing the transformative effects of algorithmic figures on the attempts to govern them.","[Cellard, Loup] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Law Sch Node, ARC Ctr Excellence Automated Decis Making & Soc, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Cellard, L (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Law Sch, ARC Ctr Excellence Automated Decis Making & Soc, Melbourne, Vic 3053, Australia.",loup.cellard@unimelb.edu.au,,,,,,,64,0,0,10,12,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,APR,2022,24,4,,,SI,,982,1000,,10.1177/14614448221079032,0,,,19,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,0K7YW,,,,,44885,WOS:000781007500009,0

The analysis focuses on discursive struggles over the construction of political issues and the role of influencers, as well as expressions of perceived interconnectedness and authenticity work among followers. It offers a qualitative understanding of audience perceptions of influencers' political power and responsibilities, and argues that this is connected to how the role of influencers is constructed - as a friend or as promotional professional.","[Arnesson, Johanna] Umea Univ, Media & Commun Studies, Umea, Sweden",Umea University,"Arnesson, J (corresponding author), Umea Univ, Dept Culture & Media Studies, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden.",johanna.arnesson@umu.se,,"Arnesson, Johanna/0000-0002-7833-8787",,,,,39,0,0,9,18,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,,,,,,,,,,,1.46144E+16,10.1177/14614448211064302,0,,44593,17,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,YV9EJ,,"hybrid, Green Published",,,44885,WOS:000753025600001,0

A panel study (N = 1786) demonstrated the emergence of identifiable profiles, attributed to differences in SM use and political interest. In addition, profiles embodied different effects on political participation over time. A second study (N = 86) was conducted thereafter, in which users' Facebook news feed use was analyzed to determine differences in news supply according to profiles.

Following attendance at a fundraising game tournament for Gamers Outreach, a non-profit charity that provides video game systems to children's hospitals, this research team conducted a survey of attendees. Our findings suggest that gamers are willing to support and monetarily contribute to a cause they believe in, but also that engaging potential donors through their preexisting interests and communities-in this case, games-can be a productive form of outreach.

Despite extensive literature on misinformation and the role of emotion in persuasion, less is understood about how emotion is used in conspiracy and debunking messages on video platforms and the impact of emotional framing on public engagement with science on social media. Our article fills this gap by analyzing thousands of YouTube videos that propagate or debunk COVID-19 conspiracy theories from March to May 2020. We found that conspiracy and debunking videos used the emotions of trust and fear differently depending on the issue framing of the conspiracy. Our article also reveals a dilemma facing debunking messages-when debunking videos used more trust-related emotions, these videos received more likes yet fewer views. These findings shed new light on the role of emotion on user engagement with misinformation and its correction on digital platforms.","[Kim, Sang Jung] Univ Wisconsin, Sch Journalism & Mass Commun, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Chen, Kaiping] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Life Sci Commun, 1545 Observ Dr,316 Hiram Smith Hall, Madison, WI 53706 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Chen, KP (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Life Sci Commun, 1545 Observ Dr,316 Hiram Smith Hall, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",kchen67@wisc.edu,,"Chen, Kaiping/0000-0002-5864-5333; KIM, SANG JUNG/0000-0001-5861-728X",,,,,78,0,0,16,16,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1177/14614448221105877,0,,44743,22,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,2W8QJ,,,,,44885,WOS:000824782400001,0

Drawing on interview data, we offer a holistic picture of the processes and structures implicated in this instance of astroturfing, with a focus on how WhatsApp is positioned within them. The authors' access to campaigners affords a rare inside view of these processes and structures, and contributes to a growing body of work on the WhatsAppification of election campaigns globally. In addition, the article builds on scholarship on social media election campaigning in Indonesia by drawing attention to the role WhatsApp's unique features play in surreptitiously influencing public discourse.","[Baulch, Emma] Monash Univ Malaysia, Media & Commun, Sch Arts & Social Sci, Bandar Sunway, Malaysia; [Matamoros-Fernandez, Ariadna] Queensland Univ Technol, Digital Media, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Suwana, Fiona] Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia",Monash University; Monash University Sunway; Queensland University of Technology (QUT); University of Sydney,"Baulch, E (corresponding author), Monash Univ Malaysia, Sch Arts & Social Sci, Jalan Lagoon Selatan, Bandar Sunway 47500, Selangor Darul, Malaysia.",Emma.Baulch@monash.edu,,"Matamoros Fernandez, Ariadna/0000-0003-2149-3820",,,,,42,0,0,4,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,,,,,,,,,,,1.46144E+16,10.1177/14614448221088274,0,,44652,19,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,0O5SP,,Green Submitted,,,44885,WOS:000783586100001,0

In the financial sector, for example, algorithms are used in credit scoring, money has become transactional data sought after by large data-driven companies, while financial technologies (FinTech) are emerging as a locus of information warfare. To grasp the context specificity of algorithmic governance and the assumptions on which its evaluation within different domains is based, we comparatively study the sociotechnical imaginaries of algorithmic governance in European Union (EU) policy on online disinformation and FinTech. We find that sociotechnical imaginaries prevalent in EU policy documents on disinformation and FinTech are highly divergent. While the first can be characterized as an algorithm-facilitated attempt to return to the presupposed status quo (absence of manipulation) without a defined future imaginary, the latter places technological innovation at the centre of realizing a globally competitive Digital Single Market.","[Wijermars, Marielle] Maastricht Univ, Cyber Secur & Polit, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Makhortykh, Mykola] Univ Bern, Inst Commun & Media Studies, Bern, Switzerland",Maastricht University; University of Bern,"Wijermars, M (corresponding author), Maastricht Univ, FASoS, POB 616, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands.",m.wijermars@maastrichtuniversity.nl,"Wijermars, Marielle/GWC-6867-2022","Wijermars, Marielle/0000-0001-7735-4403; Makhortykh, Mykola/0000-0001-7143-5317",,,,,58,0,0,9,18,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,APR,2022,24,4,,,SI,,942,963,1.46144E+16,10.1177/14614448221079033,0,,44652,22,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,0K7YW,,"Green Published, hybrid",,,44885,WOS:000780804300001,0

Since that time, gamblification has been used to describe a range of phenomena in increasingly diffuse contexts; it has been variously used as a proxy for the convergence of gaming and gambling, to describe specific monetisation practices, or as a means of motivating consumer behaviours. Conceptual clarity has been further muddied by the positioning of gamblification as a form of gamification. This work provides a definition of gamblification, which draws upon and consolidates existing uses of the term while also providing a lens through which the differing aspects of gamblification can be understood and appraised. By doing so, this work will establish a clear conceptual framework, which can structure in-depth discussions of this multi-dimensional phenomenon.","[Macey, Joseph] Univ Turku, Ctr Excellence Game Culture Studies, Turku, Finland; [Macey, Joseph] Tampere Univ, Tampere, Finland; [Hamari, Juho] Tampere Univ, Gamificat, Tampere, Finland; [Hamari, Juho] Tampere Univ, Fac Informat Technol & Commun Sci, Gamificat Grp, Tampere, Finland",University of Turku; Tampere University; Tampere University; Tampere University,"Macey, J (corresponding author), Univ Turku, Ctr Excellence Game Culture Studies, Porin Yliopistokeskus, Pohjoisranta 11 D, Pori 28100, Finland.",jrmace@utu.fi,,,Academy of Finland project Centre of Excellence in Game Culture Studies (CoE-GameCult) [312396]; Academy of Finland Flagship Programme (Forest-Human-Machine Interplay [UNITE]) [337653]; Finnish Foundation for Alcohol Studies,Academy of Finland project Centre of Excellence in Game Culture Studies (CoE-GameCult); Academy of Finland Flagship Programme (Forest-Human-Machine Interplay [UNITE]); Finnish Foundation for Alcohol Studies,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the Academy of Finland project Centre of Excellence in Game Culture Studies (CoE-GameCult, #312396) and the Academy of Finland Flagship Programme under Grant No. 337653 (Forest-Human-Machine Interplay [UNITE]).

We contrast the 'Robodebt' programme with explicit digital inclusion policy on disability in Australia, noting that such digital inclusion policy does not specifically acknowledge yet alone address ADM or other aspects of automation.

By analyzing corporate social media and promotional materials alongside in-app developments, we find that these companies reimagined app affordances to promote virtual dating, a set of practices and symbolic meanings that prioritize visual, synchronous digital interaction as the most responsible, reliable, and successful dating approach to the pandemic. Virtual dating centers apps as databases of potential partners while prescribing modes of use aimed toward affective relief, displays of authenticity, and romantic courtship.

I voted selfies exist at the intersection of competing ideals of citizenship, including dutiful citizenship, which centers civic duty and voting, and self-actualizing citizenship, which focuses on individualized and expressive forms of political participation. I argue that these images can be understood through historically resonant communication practices, namely, as a mediated manifestation of 19th-century political congregations that I term embodied mass communication. To trace how voters perform embodied visions of citizenship through shared practices of digital self-representation, I conducted a content analysis of I voted selfies posted to Twitter on US Election Day 2016. In these selfies, voters present their bodies as civic evidence, frame individual representations to signify visual collectives, and creatively contextualize their political participation. Their selfies suggest how representational rituals can reflect and reconstitute citizenship models.","[Butkowski, Chelsea P.] Cornell Univ, Dept Commun, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Cornell University,"Butkowski, CP (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, 450B Mann Lib Bldg, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",cpb96@cornell.edu,,"Butkowski, Chelsea/0000-0001-5593-2487",,,,,64,1,1,6,11,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,,,,,,,,,,,1.46144E+16,10.1177/14614448211068937,0,,44562,20,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,YP2QF,,,,,44885,WOS:000748470600001,0

To understand how digital platform providers experiment with making commitments regarding their regulation, this article process-traces Facebook's content regulation to ask how it self-regulates despite constant pressures for policy intervention. The first part of the article shows how Facebook moved from its initial thin self-regulatory regime toward what I call enhanced self-regulation, which relies on first-party and independent third-party intermediaries. Thereafter, I show how Facebook self-regulated the balance between public and private interests over time and across the regimes. The findings suggest that powerful actors such as Facebook can innovate in self-regulation by reallocating content-related responsibilities to intermediaries and subsequently create polycentric governance regimes. Lessons about how self-regulators that face public criticism can make more credible commitments to public interests are then drawn from the strengths and weakness of enhanced self-regulation.","[Medzini, Rotem] Federmann Sch Publ Policy & Govt, Publ Policy, Jerusalem, Israel",,"Medzini, R (corresponding author), Federmann Sch Publ Policy & Govt, Campus Mt Scopus Jerusalem, IL-9190501 Jerusalem, Israel.",rotem.medzini@mail.huji.ac.il,,"Medzini, Rotem/0000-0002-1859-8798","Federmann School of Public Policy and Government Multiyear Excellence Scholarship; Federmann Cyber Security Center; Israel National Cyber Directorate; Leonard Davis Institute for International Relations at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem; Israel Science Fund [ISF1029/15, ISF 324/18]",Federmann School of Public Policy and Government Multiyear Excellence Scholarship; Federmann Cyber Security Center; Israel National Cyber Directorate; Leonard Davis Institute for International Relations at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem; Israel Science Fund(Israel Science Foundation),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was funded and supported by The Federmann School of Public Policy and Government Multiyear Excellence Scholarship; by The Federmann Cyber Security Center in conjunction with the Israel National Cyber Directorate; and by The Leonard Davis Institute for International Relations at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

This study focuses on anti-vaccination views in the Netherlands, which have intensified during the COVID-19 pandemic. We examined the structure and development of five Dutch anti-vaccination Telegram groups and studied their interactivity and posting behaviour. Using group-based trajectory modelling, we examined the development of users' posting behaviour in these groups. We find four posting trajectories across all five groups.

This study examines how various uses of a social technology platform in a global organization relate to communication visibility and increased metaknowledge among workers. In addition, our analysis investigates how communication visibility relates to workers' knowledge-sharing intentions and engagement.

However, research has yet to examine how life partners in this age group support one another in using technology. We interviewed 50 older adults representing 25 couples in five countries about their sources of support when using the Internet. Partner support was more common than existing literature suggests and was motivated by in-home convenience, partners' level of digital skills, and a desire to avoid burdening other network members. At odds with a one-way view of digital assistance, partners often helped each other in different domains of Internet use based on career experience and personal interest. Partner support could both aid and discourage self-sufficiency, depending on how assistance was provided. Studying couples helps clarify how older adults develop relationships of mutual aid and dependency out of the everyday (un)availability of technology support.","[Marler, Will] Univ Zurich, Dept Commun & Media Res, Zurich, Switzerland; [Hargittai, Eszter] Univ Zurich, Commun & Media Res, Zurich, Switzerland; [Hargittai, Eszter] Univ Zurich, Internet Use & Soc, Zurich, Switzerland",University of Zurich; University of Zurich; University of Zurich,"Marler, W (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Dept Commun & Media Res IKMZ, Andreasstr 15, CH-8050 Zurich, Switzerland.",w.marler@ikmz.uzh.ch,,"Marler, Will/0000-0003-0380-1279",,,,,47,2,2,7,12,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,,,,,,,,,,,1.46144E+16,10.1177/14614448211068437,0,,44562,17,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,YV6VS,,hybrid,,,44885,WOS:000752866200001,0

Our findings show that these mechanisms are decisively shaped by patterns of everyday life that are not captured by the scholarly foci on either content- or technology-influences on media use.

It examines a subcultural community-the queer-fantasy community-on Chinese social media to expound how members of this community interpreted China's censorship policy, interacted based on the interpretation, and participated in censorship. Integrating structural topic modeling and emergent coding, this study finds that a political environment of uncertainty fostered divergent imaginaries about censorship. These imaginaries encouraged participatory censorship within the online community, which strengthened the political control of the Internet in the absence of the state. This study illuminates how participatory censorship works, especially in non-professional and non-politically mobilized online communities.

This essay makes a different contribution, in that we seek to understand the impact of the viral version of #MeToo on the established primarily Black community developed by Tarana Burke. In this essay, we use the framework of intersectionality and organizational paradox to examine the differences in the social construction of the two versions of the movement. The framework of intersectionality allows us to examine how the viral version of #MeToo perpetuated by Alyssa Milano reified the social construction of inequalities and interlocking systems of oppression for Black and other women of color. The article examines the effects of Milano's entrance into the me too space on the community built through Burke's me too movement. We identify an illumination/occlusion paradox that creates the illusion of inclusivity, creates difficulty in community boundary management, and allows for outsider gaze into a previously safe space. We argue for moving beyond the considerations of assigning credit for the movement and instead consider the impacts of the paradox of the original community experiencing erasure through the abrupt and swift increased visibility of the hashtag.","[Boyd, Alicia] DePaul Univ, Coll Comp & Digital Media, Chicago, IL 60604 USA; [McEwan, Bree] Univ Toronto Mississauga, Inst Commun Culture & Informat Technol, Mississauga, ON, Canada",DePaul University; University of Toronto; University Toronto Mississauga,"McEwan, B (corresponding author), Univ Toronto Mississauga, 3359 Mississauga Rd, Mississauga, ON L5L 1C6, Canada.",bree.mcewan@utoronto.ca,,"McEwan, Bree/0000-0002-9452-6913",,,,,74,0,0,1,1,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,,,,,,,,,,,1.46144E+16,10.1177/14614448221099187,0,,44713,18,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,2D7MW,,hybrid,,,44885,WOS:000811727200001,0

However, extant empirical research does not clearly support this assumption. The current study argues that social comparison processes and the metacognitive perception of knowledge mediate the relationship between evidence in comments and participation intention in different ways. Findings from two online experiments (N-Study1 = 368; N-Study(2) = 854) support this assumption: For three different topics, the results show that providing evidence in comments, as opposed to merely opinions, increases participants' perceived knowledge by increasing their factual knowledge. At the same time, evidence in comments decreases participants' perceived knowledge through social comparison with other commenters. Higher perceived knowledge is related to increased participation intention. In summary, the studies reveal psychological mechanisms that explain why high deliberative quality of online discussions does not necessarily stimulate further user participation.","[Schaefer, Svenja] Univ Vienna, Vienna, Austria; [Mueller, Philipp] Univ Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany; [Ziegele, Marc] Heinrich Heine Univ Dusseldorf, Dusseldorf, Germany",University of Vienna; University of Mannheim; Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf,"Schafer, S (corresponding author), Univ Vienna, Dept Commun, Kolingasse 14-16, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.",svenja.schaefer@unvie.ac.at; p.mueller@uni-mannheim.de; ziegele@hhu.de,,"Muller, Philipp/0000-0002-5351-0608; Schafer, Svenja/0000-0002-6401-1564","Faculty of Social Science, University of Vienna, Austria","Faculty of Social Science, University of Vienna, Austria","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Editing service costs for this article were financially supported by the Faculty of Social Science, University of Vienna, Austria.",,58,1,1,2,9,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,,,,,,,,,,,1.46144E+16,10.1177/14614448211073059,0,,44562,26,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,YV0UH,,"Green Published, hybrid",,,44885,WOS:000752448400001,0

The findings demonstrated larger effect sizes for online bonding and bridging social capital than offline bonding and bridging social capital.","[Ng, Yu-Leung] Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Dept Journalism, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Hong Kong Baptist University,"Ng, YL (corresponding author), Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Sch Commun & Film, Dept Journalism, Kowloon Tong,Kowloon, Room 933,Commun & Visual Arts Bldg,5 Hereford Rd, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",yuleungng@hkbu.edu.hk,,"Ng, Yu-Leung/0000-0002-7140-1616",Hong Kong Baptist University [RC-SGT2/19-20/COMM/001],Hong Kong Baptist University,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study was supported by the Tier 2 Start-up Grant of Hong Kong Baptist University (No.: RC-SGT2/19-20/COMM/001).",,52,2,2,17,31,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,,,,,,,,,,,1.46144E+16,10.1177/14614448221074047,0,,44562,16,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,YT5WI,,,,,44885,WOS:000751429400001,0

Most articles aimed to investigate the public's reaction to fake health information, concluding that health agencies and professionals should increase their online presence. The articles also suggest that future work should aim to improve the quality of health information on social media platforms, develop new tools and strategies to combat fake news sharing, and study the credibility of health information.

Employing a 2 (incivility vs. no incivility) x 2 (like-minded vs. opposing stance) between-subjects design, data from an online experiment (N = 452) were analyzed applying a path model (SPSS AMOS). Results revealed that participants attributed more aggressive and less nonaggressive motives to senders of uncivil messages. The attribution of aggressive motives consequently increased hostile inferences about the target. A similar pattern occurred when individuals were exposed to an opposing stance. In result, hostile inferences about the sender's traits decreased participants' willingness to discuss.","[Kluck, Jan P.; Kraemer, Nicole C.] Univ Duisburg Essen, Social Psychol Media & Commun, Forsthausweg 2, D-47057 Duisburg, Germany",University of Duisburg Essen,"Kluck, JP (corresponding author), Univ Duisburg Essen, Social Psychol Media & Commun, Forsthausweg 2, D-47057 Duisburg, Germany.",jan.kluck@uni-due.de,,"Kluck, Jan P./0000-0001-8432-8705",Digital Society research program - Ministry of Culture and Science of the German State of North Rhine-Westphalia,Digital Society research program - Ministry of Culture and Science of the German State of North Rhine-Westphalia,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was funded by the Digital Society research program funded by the Ministry of Culture and Science of the German State of North Rhine-Westphalia.",,41,2,2,3,22,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,DEC,2022,24,12,,,,,2743,2762,1.46144E+16,10.1177/14614448211000666,0,,44256,20,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,5W0RK,,hybrid,,,44885,WOS:000635311300001,0

Drawing from digital ethnographic research, vlogs/interviews of workers, and literature review, we argue for a conceptualization of platform scam that focuses on multiple forms of platform dishonesty and uncertainty. We characterize scam as a structuring element of the algorithmic management enacted by platform labor. The first case engages with when platforms scam workers by discussing Uber drivers' experiences with the illusive surge pricing. The second case discusses when workers (have to) scam platforms by focusing on Amazon Mechanical Turk microworkers' experiences with faking their identities. The third case presents when platforms lead workers to scam third parties, by engaging with how Brazilian click farm platforms' workers use bots/fake accounts to engage with social media. Our focus on platform scams thus highlights the particular dimensions of faking, fraud, and deception operating in platform labor. This notion of platform scam expands and complexifies the understanding of scam within platform labor studies. Departing from workers' experiences, we engage with the asymmetries and unequal power relations present in the algorithmic management of labor.","[Grohmann, Rafael] Unisinos Univ, Av Unisinos,950, BR-93022750 Sao Leopoldo, RS, Brazil; [Pereira, Gabriel; Guerra, Abel] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London, England; [Abilio, Ludmila Costhek] Univ Estadual Campinas, Ctr Labour Studies CESIT, Campinas, SP, Brazil; [Moreschi, Bruno] Univ Sao Paulo, Fac Architecture & Urbanism, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Jurno, Amanda] Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Universidade Estadual de Campinas; Universidade de Sao Paulo; Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais,"Grohmann, R (corresponding author), Unisinos Univ, Av Unisinos,950, BR-93022750 Sao Leopoldo, RS, Brazil.",rafaelgrohmann@unisinos.br,"Moreschi, Bruno/GPW-8431-2022; ABILIO, LUDMILA/GVU-8910-2022","Moreschi, Bruno/0000-0001-8938-5004; Pereira, Gabriel/0000-0002-9267-4189","University of Cambridge/Histories of Artificial Intelligence project; National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq/Brazil); Center for Arts, Design, and Social Research (CAD + SR); Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP/Brazil); Coordination for Improvement of Higher Education (CAPES/Brazil)","University of Cambridge/Histories of Artificial Intelligence project; National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq/Brazil)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); Center for Arts, Design, and Social Research (CAD + SR); Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP/Brazil)(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)); Coordination for Improvement of Higher Education (CAPES/Brazil)","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Parts of this research were supported by the University of Cambridge/Histories of Artificial Intelligence project; the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq/Brazil); Center for Arts, Design, and Social Research (CAD + SR); The Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP/Brazil); and Coordination for Improvement of Higher Education (CAPES/Brazil).",,61,0,0,10,10,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,JUL,2022,24,7,,,,,1611,1631,,10.1177/14614448221099225,0,,,21,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,3A7BM,,"Green Submitted, Green Accepted",,,44885,WOS:000827410900005,0

Through in-depth interviews with 25 users, we revealed their expected experience related to the dual identity of anime otaku and technology geeks alongside social segregation and loneliness. We found their actual experience highlighted how anime elements offset their dissatisfactions caused by AI weakness and the uncanny valley. Three specific anime-enabled strategies were illustrated, namely anime characterization, gamification, and idolization.

We conducted a study in the context of content moderation and discovered that individual differences relating to trust in humans, fear of artificial intelligence (AI), power usage, and political ideology can predict whether a user will invoke the positive or negative machine heuristic. For example, users who distrust other humans tend to be more positive toward machines.

It also provides a critique of the often simplistic arguments found in public discourses around children's digital media use.","[Milosevic, Tijana] Dublin City Univ, Antibullying Ctr, Dublin 9, Ireland; [Milosevic, Tijana] Dublin City Univ, ADAPT SFI, Dublin 9, Ireland; [Bhroin, Niamh Ni; Staksrud, Elisabeth] Univ Oslo, Dept Media & Commun, Oslo, Norway; [Olafsson, Kjartan] Univ Akureyri, Akureyri, Iceland; [Wachs, Sebastian] Univ Potsdam, Dept Educ Studies, Educ & Socializat Theory, Potsdam, Germany",Dublin City University; Dublin City University; University of Oslo; University of Akureyri; University of Potsdam,"Milosevic, T (corresponding author), Dublin City Univ, Antibullying Ctr, Dublin 9, Ireland.;Milosevic, T (corresponding author), Dublin City Univ, ADAPT SFI, Dublin 9, Ireland.",Tijana.milosevic@dcu.ie,"Milosevic, Tijana/AEM-4225-2022","Milosevic, Tijana/0000-0003-1502-7479; Staksrud, Elisabeth/0000-0001-9829-4817; Olafsson, Kjartan/0000-0002-3790-8990; Ni Bhroin, Niamh/0000-0001-8110-1994",Norwegian National State Budget 2017-2018 under the Ministry of Justice and Public Security's Proposition 1S [20162017]; Norwegian National State Budget 2017-2018 under the Ministry of Justice and Public Security's Proposition 12 S Escalation Plan against Violence and Abuse (2017-2021) [20161017]; UiO:Norden; European Union [801522]; Science Foundation Ireland; European Regional Development Fund through the ADAPT Centre for Digital Content Technology [13/RC/2106_P2],Norwegian National State Budget 2017-2018 under the Ministry of Justice and Public Security's Proposition 1S; Norwegian National State Budget 2017-2018 under the Ministry of Justice and Public Security's Proposition 12 S Escalation Plan against Violence and Abuse (2017-2021); UiO:Norden; European Union(European Commission); Science Foundation Ireland(Science Foundation IrelandEuropean Commission); European Regional Development Fund through the ADAPT Centre for Digital Content Technology,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The data collection was funded from the Norwegian National State Budget 2017-2018 under the Ministry of Justice and Public Security's Proposition 1S (20162017) and Proposition 12 S (20161017) Escalation Plan against Violence and Abuse (2017-2021).

The aim of this review was to investigate the validity of this claim by comparing the operationalizations and results of studies into the association of ASMU and PSMU with well-being (e.g. happiness) and ill-being (e.g. depressive symptoms). We found 40 survey-based studies, which utilized a hodgepodge of 36 operationalizations of ASMU and PSMU and which yielded 172 associations of ASMU and/or PSMU with well-/ill-being. Most studies did not support the hypothesized associations of ASMU and PSMU with well-/ill-being. Time spent on ASMU and PSMU may be too coarse to lead to meaningful associations with well-/ill-being. Therefore, future studies should take characteristics of the content of social media (e.g. the valence), its senders (e.g. pre-existing mood), and receivers (e.g. differential susceptibility) into account.","[Valkenburg, Patti M.] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [van Driel, Irene I.; Beyens, Ine] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Commun Res ASCoR, Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam; University of Amsterdam,"Valkenburg, PM (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Commun Res, Spui 21, NL-1012 CX Amsterdam, Netherlands.",p.m.valkenburg@uva.nl,"Beyens, Ine/ABE-9982-2020","Beyens, Ine/0000-0001-7023-867X; Valkenburg, Patti M./0000-0003-0477-8429",NWO Spinoza Prize; Gravitation grant (NWO) - Dutch Research Council (NWO) [024.001.003],NWO Spinoza Prize; Gravitation grant (NWO) - Dutch Research Council (NWO),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study was funded by an NWO Spinoza Prize and a Gravitation grant (NWO Grant 024.001.003; Consortium on Individual Development) awarded to Patti Valkenburg by the Dutch Research Council (NWO).",,71,19,19,27,53,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,FEB,2022,24,2,,,SI,,530,549,1.46144E+16,10.1177/14614448211065425,0,,44531,20,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,YX7ZK,,"Green Published, hybrid",,,44885,WOS:000738776500001,0

Specifically, it focuses on politically motivated unfriending and examines its influence on individuals' political engagement, namely political expression and information consumption on social media. Furthermore, considering the importance of minority-majority relations for understanding disconnection phenomena, we investigate whether the impact of unfriending is more pronounced among opinion minorities than majorities. Using a two-wave panel survey conducted in the post-Umbrella Movement Hong Kong, we find that politically motivated unfriending predicts an increased level of political expression, but that it is only significant among people who perceive themselves as holding minority opinions. At the same time, we find no relationship between unfriending and information consumption on social media. Based on the findings, we discuss the implications of unfriending for building digital safe spaces and its distinct role in promoting political engagement in times of political conflicts.","[Zhu, Qinfeng] Univ Groningen, Dept Media Studies & Journalism, Oude Kijk Int Jatstraat 26, NL-9712 EK Groningen, Netherlands; City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Media & Commun, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Skoric, Marko M.] City Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Qinfeng] Univ Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen; City University of Hong Kong; City University of Hong Kong; University of Groningen,"Zhu, QF (corresponding author), Univ Groningen, Dept Media Studies & Journalism, Oude Kijk Int Jatstraat 26, NL-9712 EK Groningen, Netherlands.",qinfeng.zhu@rug.nl,"Zhu, Qinfeng/AAA-8996-2022; Skoric, Marko/K-3598-2015","Zhu, Qinfeng/0000-0001-8038-0274; Skoric, Marko/0000-0001-6578-9872",City University of Hong Kong,City University of Hong Kong(City University of Hong Kong),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: by City University of Hong Kong.",,81,4,4,4,18,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,DEC,2022,24,12,,,,,2659,2679,1.46144E+15,10.1177/1461444821999994,0,,44256,21,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,5W0RK,,hybrid,,,44885,WOS:000628933200001,0

The empirical context of this study is legacy media where the introduction of automation, together with topical considerations of journalistic ethics and responsibility, has given rise to substantial reflection on received conceptions and practices. The results show a continuing resistance to attributions of agency and responsibility to machines.

I develop the frame of survival of the cryptic to call attention to the way this conception fails to acknowledge how power shapes the conditions of surveillance: that race and racism, gender and misogyny affect not only who is most impacted by surveillance but also how the encryption technologies developed to inhibit surveillance were designed-and, as importantly, who they were designed for.

The analysis is driven by the following questions: What are the particularities of digital lifeline communication in the context of IC? Can lifeline communication shape what is coming into being in the context of wished-for children and/or motherhood? Can (digital) life be challenged, extended, or created in this context? Drawing on interviews and online posts from 260 Instagram accounts and three blogs, I argue that digital lifeline communication in TTC environments facilitates digital existence and digital life as the notions of motherhood and longed-for and lost children attain a form of digital materiality through posts and discussions.","[Stenstrom, Kristina] Stockholm Univ, Dept Sociol, Univ Svagen 10B, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden",Stockholm University,"Stenstrom, K (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Dept Sociol, Univ Svagen 10B, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",kristina.stenstrom@sociology.su.se,,"Stenstrom, Kristina/0000-0002-8423-6218",Anna Ahlstrom and Ellen Terserus Foundation,Anna Ahlstrom and Ellen Terserus Foundation,"The author(s) received the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study is part of Stenstrom's project Spaces of loss and becoming Involuntary childlessness online at the Department of Computer and Systems Sciences at Stockholm University.

Findings reveal that constant monitoring on ride-hail apps feels oppressive to drivers, and it requires them to engage in significant unpaid labor in the form of reputation auditing. Nevertheless, drivers also find ways to caption surveillance outputs and thus shape their meanings. They engage in three strategies-juxtaposing existing metrics, expanding the field of vision, and requiring others to bear witness-to clarify, contextualize, and reclaim their visibility. The ability to reconfigure meanings of visibility, and specifically to navigate between the experience of being watched and that of being seen, represents an underexplored avenue of agency within studies of work surveillance.","[Mosseri, Sarah] Univ Sydney, Business Sch, Women Work & Leadership Res Grp, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of Sydney,"Mosseri, S (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Business Sch, Discipline Work & Organisat Studies, 4172 Abercrombie Bldg, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",sarah.mosseri@sydney.edu,,"Mosseri, Sarah/0000-0002-9548-6984",National Science Foundation [1738706]; University of Virginia Bankard Fund for Political Economy,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); University of Virginia Bankard Fund for Political Economy,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the National Science Foundation (grant number 1738706), the University of Virginia Bankard Fund for Political Economy and the University of Virginia Department of Sociology.",,70,0,0,2,20,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,MAR,2022,24,3,,,,,600,620,1.46144E+15,10.1177/1461444820966752,0,,44105,21,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,ZI5GO,,,,,44885,WOS:000583728800001,0

By analyzing a two-wave survey conducted before the 2016 presidential election in the United States, this study tests a theoretical model in which observation of others' political activities on social media inspires users themselves to model similar political behaviors, which foster offline political participation. Autoregressive models show that the link between political observation and activities on social media is stronger among users surrounded with similar others and politically homogeneous networks. The results highlight the need to cultivate engaged citizenship norms for individuals' political activities on social media to be carried over to participation beyond the realm of social media.","[Kim, Dam Hee] Univ Arizona, Dept Commun, Bldg 25,Room 219,1103 E Univ Blvd, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Ellison, Nicole B.] Univ Michigan, Sch Informat, Informat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Arizona; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Kim, DH (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Dept Commun, Bldg 25,Room 219,1103 E Univ Blvd, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",damheekim@arizona.edu,,,Howard R.

Drawing on qualitative interviews with 15 displaced Rohingya members and activists in Brisbane, Australia, this article demonstrates how transnational digital engagements foreground the construction of the Rohingya diaspora, and subsequently how the transnational identities are negotiated and mediated online. The findings show that the social media platforms facilitated the Rohingya diaspora development and identity construction through building an 'imagined community' of resistance, transnational advocacy networks and diasporic media production. At the same time, this article explores how online activism evolved and marginal voices emerged in cyberspace longing for home(land), justice and citizenship rights.

By investigating 225,252 Yelp reviews toward 1,937 restaurants in Charlotte, North Carolina, we find that while displaying hygiene scores digitally can inform consumers in a way that reduces bias in reviews, it paradoxically can also promote the creation of more reviews that are biased, something we call the cognitive-discursive dilemma. Specifically, after the digital display on Yelp, reviews mentioning hygiene were more in line with scores, indicating an improvement in accuracy across reviews in general. Yet, the digital display also led to greater attention to hygiene, leading to lower scores for restaurants of lower social status as measured by price and cuisine type. Our findings thus call for more attention to a broader theoretical implication about the provision of accurate information on review sites.","[Yu, Chao; Margolin, Drew] Cornell Univ, Dept Commun, 487B Mann Lib Bldg, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA",Cornell University,"Yu, C (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Dept Commun, 487B Mann Lib Bldg, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.",cy395@cornell.edu,,"Yu, Chao/0000-0002-4279-2152",,,,,51,0,0,0,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1177/14614448221127674,0,,44835,19,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,5F3CD,,,,,44885,WOS:000866195600001,0

While it's accurate to say they don't have the same information-sharing norms as people in traditional employment arrangements, some do gather, in part in digital communities. Online forums, in this space, have become popular sites for gathering, sharing information, and comparing practices. These behaviors provide an opportunity to examine gig workers as emergent communities of practice, and to analyze how work, identity, skills, and workspaces co-constitute each other as sociotechnical environments of work change. In this research, I examine workers' interactions in an online forum, and focus on how they talk about scams. Analysis reveals that talking about scams is a way for workers to enact belonging in their community of practice. Victims are belittled by other workers, who frame vulnerability, and lack of foresight due to unfamiliarity with the forum itself, as a lack of authenticity. Repudiations are denunciations through which workers assert their belonging.

Drawing on qualitative fieldwork on the 8chan imageboard, we position baking as a collective, knowledge-making activity built on the affordances of social media designed to construct specific facts and theories that maintain QAnon's cohesion over time. Bakers demonstrate populist expertise, the rejection of legacy media accounts of current events in favor of the alternative facts constructed through their systematic research programs.

Regarding methods of data analysis, I take a corpus-assisted discourse analytical approach to YouTube's texts on advertiser-friendliness. That is, I take a wide-angle view on all concordance lines of 'content' and identify occurrences of different forms of vagueness. Findings suggest that at least 26% of the lines of 'content' detailing YouTube's ad-friendly content guidelines exhibit at least one of eight forms of vagueness. Consequently, content creators - left unsure about the monetisability of particular content - may choose not to push any boundaries but to produce noncontroversial content, which, in turn, may impede content plurality on YouTube.","[Kopf, Susanne] Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Welthandelspl 1, A-1120 Vienna, Austria",Vienna University of Economics & Business,"Kopf, S (corresponding author), Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Welthandelspl 1, A-1120 Vienna, Austria.",susanne.kopf@wu.ac.at,,"Kopf, Susanne/0000-0002-1566-9300",,,,,58,0,0,2,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,,,,,,,,,,,1.46144E+16,10.1177/14614448221077354,0,,44593,19,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,ZF5NU,,hybrid,,,44885,WOS:000759615300001,0

We test this logic with 16,674 hosts and 396,923 reviews on Airbnb in New York City. We find that the majority hosts (i.e. White) acquire their first review and third review (enough to trigger the publication of aggregate rating) more quickly than minority hosts (i.e. Asian and Black). However, setting listings instantly bookable helps reduce the racial difference in review acquisition. Our analyses also reveal that compared with Asian or Black hosts, White hosts receive higher aggregate ratings and more positive reviews at early stage of review acquisition. Such racial difference attenuates over time as the number of reviews increases. Our findings contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of racial discrimination against minorities in the sharing economy.","[Yu, Chao; Margolin, Drew] Cornell Univ, Dept Commun, 487B Mann Lib Bldg, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA",Cornell University,"Yu, C (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Dept Commun, 487B Mann Lib Bldg, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.",cy395@cornell.edu,,"Yu, Chao/0000-0002-4279-2152; Margolin, Drew/0000-0003-0257-6217",,,,,46,0,0,12,17,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,,,,,,,,,,,1.46144E+16,10.1177/14614448221075774,0,,44593,21,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,ZE1IQ,,,,,44885,WOS:000758644400001,0

To explore the human-machine entanglements in search engine evaluation, we draw upon 21 in-depth interviews with raters located across the globe; we supplement our interview data with an analysis of worker training documents. Our findings reveal that despite Google's stated efforts to make algorithmic systems more sensitive to human subtlety, raters experience their work in ways that are-paradoxically-algorithmic. Indeed, workers framed their experiences through regimes of standardization, discipline, and invisibility.

The ensuing discord on the site is conceptualized here as contested platform governance, or a conflict between users and ownership, in which not only are a platform's policies and features challenged, but also its core values, identity, and/or purposes are put into question. By examining 238 Tumblr posts, this analysis identifies the unique ways users combatted the ban and (re)inscribed community values, while also contesting the owners' legitimacy to govern the platform. Holding implications for the site's long-term survival, such conflicts capture a critical moment in which the boundaries of power between users and ownership are challenged and, possibly, transformed. By examining Tumblr's Not Safe For Work (NSFW) ban through the lens of platform governance, this study offers insight into how power and its limits are negotiated online.","[Sybert, Jeanna] Univ Penn, Annenberg Sch Commun, 3620 Walnut St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania,"Sybert, J (corresponding author), Univ Penn, Annenberg Sch Commun, 3620 Walnut St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",jeanna.sybert@asc.upenn.edu,"Sybert, Jeanna/ABP-8955-2022","Sybert, Jeanna/0000-0001-5208-3918",,,,,60,3,3,5,14,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,OCT,2022,24,10,,,,,2311,2331,1.46144E+15,10.1177/1461444821996715,0,,44228,21,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,4A4MW,,,,,44885,WOS:000624864300001,0

While there is not much explicit reasoning on Twitter, many users link to external resources in their tweets. This study zooms in on the justificatory capacity of those links and investigates their deliberative function on the platform. A qualitative exploration of material from four countries shows that links to external resources support Twitter discourse by regularly substantiating user statements in the context of both information and argumentation. Links with a truth-based informative function are posted to support deliberative truth claims with empirical evidence, thus adding primarily to theoretical discourses. Links with a norm-based argumentative function are shared to legitimate positions against social standards. They contribute to practical discourses about courses of action by sustaining deliberative claims for normative rightness. The country comparison suggests that societal divisions foster a norm-based argumentative rather than truth-based informative use of links on Twitter.","[Jakob, Julia] Univ Mannheim, Polit Commun, Mannheim, Germany",University of Mannheim,"Jakob, J (corresponding author), Univ Mannheim, Mannheim Ctr European Social Res, A5,6 Bldg A, D-68159 Mannheim, Germany.",julia.jakob@mzes.uni-mannheim.de,,"Jakob, Julia/0000-0003-2340-5193","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) [260291564]","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation)(German Research Foundation (DFG))","The author disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) [grant number 260291564].",,62,3,3,2,6,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,MAY,2022,24,5,,,,,1196,1215,1.46144E+15,10.1177/1461444820972388,0,,44136,20,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,0V9EV,,"Green Published, hybrid",,,44885,WOS:000624861400001,0

Informants demonstrate how e-books and audiobooks enhance reading experiences, as digital affordances influence the how and the when of literary consumption. Three prominent findings are stated. (1) Readers adapt reading mode to the situation, and experienced readers have developed strategies to maximise the ultimate combination of title, format and reading conditions. (2) Digital reading favours lighter texts. This dimension is more substantial for audiobooks, relating to the wide choice of combining audiobooks with other activities. (3) Being devoted readers motivates people to develop strategies to ensure further reading.

Focusing on the changes in the use of Email, Chat and Social Network Sites by older people, it explores the process by which new media become 'old' and reach a saturation point. Collected survey data suggest differences in media use between the three technology generations distinguished in this study: the 'mechanical' generation (born in 1938 or before), the 'household revolution' generation (born between 1939 and 1948), and the 'technology spread' generation (born between 1949 and 1963). This longitudinal and transnational study provides evidence of media saturation, showing that an increase in both the availability of and access to media does not lead to an increase in use, even in older adults who are behind in the adoption of the new media. Finally, the article discusses the findings, arguing for an interplay between individual and structural lag in later life.","[Loos, Eugene] Univ Utrecht, Sch Governance, Commun Policy & Management Studies, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Ivan, Loredana] Natl Univ Polit Studies & Publ Adm, Commun Dept, Bucharest, Romania",Utrecht University; National University of Political Studies & Public Administration,"Loos, E (corresponding author), Univ Utrecht, Sch Governance, Billhouwerstr 6, NL-3511 ZC Utrecht, Netherlands.",e.f.loos@uu.nl,,"Loos, Eugene/0000-0002-5563-935X",ACT project (Ageing Communication Technologies),ACT project (Ageing Communication Technologies),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by ACT project (Ageing Communication Technologies), https://actproject.ca/",,38,0,0,28,28,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,,,,,,,,,,,1.46144E+16,10.1177/14614448221101783,0,,44713,26,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,2I3NE,,hybrid,,,44885,WOS:000814888300001,0

Yet there are persistent divisions along language, geographic, and other lines that encourage the formation of distinct micro-spheres of networked actors (internal heterogeneity), as well as distinct media practices that work to differentiate mass media networks from networks produced by a different set of publics on social media (external heterogeneity).","[Neff, Timothy] Univ Leicester, Sch Media Commun & Sociol, Journalism, Leicester, Leics, England; [Jemielniak, Dariusz] Kozminski Univ, Management Networked & Digital Environm MINDS Dep, Warsaw, Poland",University of Leicester; Kozminski University,"Neff, T (corresponding author), Univ Leicester, Sch Media Commun & Sociol, Astley Clarke Bldg, Leicester LE1 7RDH, Leics, England.",tnll7@leicester.ac.uk,"Jemielniak, Dariusz/G-6434-2010","Jemielniak, Dariusz/0000-0002-3745-7931; Neff, Timothy/0000-0003-2980-3838",Polish National Science Centre [2019/35/B/HS6/01056],Polish National Science Centre,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Dariusz Jemielniak's participation was possible thanks to a grant no. 2019/35/B/HS6/01056 from Polish National Science Centre.",,60,0,0,4,8,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,,,,,,,,,,,1.46144E+16,10.1177/14614448221081426,0,,44621,26,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,ZZ2KT,,"hybrid, Green Published",,,44885,WOS:000773104600001,0

But how do various digital media uses relate to social connectedness when face-to-face communication is not, or much less, possible? Drawing on survey data from 2925 US adults during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, we find that different digital communication methods display different relationships with social connectedness under stay-at-home circumstances with limited in-person interactions outside the home. Overall, digital communication relates to lower social connectedness. In line with notions from social presence theory, especially digital media lower in social presence (e.g. email, social media, and online games, and to some extent text messaging) relate negatively to social connectedness, while this is not the case for higher social presence media (e.g. voice and video calls).

These organizations differ significantly from traditional brick-and-mortar non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in terms of institutional structure and some of the tactics employed to leverage both collective and connective action. Connective action may have particular relevance for young people, whose civic engagement tends to be personalized through Internet-enabled information and communication technologies-contradicting narratives implying youth are apathetic or disinterested in political and social movements. This article considers the potential significance of IMSAOs in terms of participation in social advocacy efforts, drawing on organizations leveraging fan activism-particularly the Harry Potter Alliance-as a youth-oriented example. While IMSAOs may serve as platforms and mechanisms for social debate and meaningful change by engaging young people as active stakeholders, empirical research on these emerging organizations is required.","[McInroy, Lauren B.; Beer, Oliver W.

Starting from the assumption that the aerial image is not a geomedium per se, but rather one that emerges as such through various co-operative processes of establishing geographical references with and within it, we draw on Goodwin's notions of co-operative action and Farocki's concept of operative imagery to theorize useful aerial images as co-operative images.

The article also draws from research on technological development to push back against narratives of inevitability and argue that specific dynamics of the LBSN moment, particularly the double-edged sword of hype, closed-off avenues for the media form.

Drawing on and contributing to the hashtag feminism literature, we undertook a discursive approach to examine #rape on Persian Twitter to address these gaps. Findings showed that #rape was a space for Iranian users to share abusive experiences, but they went further to discuss barriers of disclosing sexual assault as well. Developing resistive strategies and raising awareness about other muted groups such as LGBTQIA+ were other discursive practices in articulating #rape.

The concept of data turbulence emerges from studies on data friction, but this article contends that the current state of affairs requires expanding the emphasis on technosciences and materiality in these works. Drawing on Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe, the article shows that attending to antagonism and discourse makes it possible to account for the eminently political forces shaping the circulation of data.

Thematic coding of open-text responses demonstrated people's understandings of balanced digital media use as primarily concerned with subjectively appropriate amounts of use, purposeful use, social connections, non-addiction, and time for real life. Through principal components analysis, we provide a classification of the types of motivations people have for disconnecting and strategies people use to disconnect.

Through interviews with self-advocates and election professionals with disabilities involved in innovative digital mobilization efforts for progressive US political organizations and campaigns, as well as a review of related strategies, this article illuminates digital inclusivity as a process connected to, but also distinct from the outcomes of social and political inclusion and exclusion.

Our central argument is that elevators manipulate information in time. Time manipulation of elevators (movement data + genetic algorithms) produces temporal order. Elevators have become media objects because they produce data that are digitally manipulated to optimize movement. We conducted an empirical study in a multinational corporation that manufactures elevators, including 4 months of field research at multiple locations and interviewed 64 people. We show how time manipulation changes with the information architecture: first, time manipulation took place inside and during the movement of elevators by pushing the buttons. Second, time manipulation took place in the cloud by statistical mathematics. The latest development is toward decentralized social application where elevators as independent media objects manipulate time using genetic algorithms and communicate with each other. We reveal how largely hidden media affects our temporality and argue that media theory should study its implications in contemporary society.","[Laakkonen, Mika-Petri; Kivivirta, Ville] Univ Lapland, Rovaniemi, Finland",University of Lapland,"Kivivirta, V (corresponding author), Univ Lapland, Fac Social Sci, Yliopistonkatu 8, Rovaniemi 96300, Finland.",ville.kivivirta@ulapland.fi,,"Laakkonen, Mika-Petri/0000-0003-3230-7958",Business Finland; Finnish Funding Agency for Innovation [A73340],Business Finland; Finnish Funding Agency for Innovation,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by Business Finland, the Finnish Funding Agency for Innovation (project code A73340).",,61,1,1,6,9,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,,,,,,,,,,,1.46144E+16,10.1177/14614448211067460,0,,44562,18,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,YE2RA,,hybrid,,,44885,WOS:000740976200001,0

Drawing on semi-structured interviews with 27 participants, this study explores their motivations for gaming spectatorship, as well as their aversion to playing games themselves. Findings suggest the work of playing games, lack of skill, access to games, and toxic online communities are deterrents to playing games.

These conditions are exemplified by two sites in Tseung Kwan O, Hong Kong. The TKO Express is a private undersea cable that offers its clients high-speed connectivity between financial centers, supporting the fast knowledge of finance and trading, while ignoring slower or more social forms of intelligence.

Findings suggest that (1) room attendants build a politicised collective identity on Facebook, which functions as both an online community of coping and a locus of politicisation and micro-mobilisation, and (2) online politicisation of collective identity happens in online/offline interplay with the process of consensus mobilisation around the room attendants' issues (grievances), the social capital accumulated within intragroup and intergroup networks (social embeddedness) and the expectation of changing conditions and/or policies through protest (efficacy).","[Alcalde-Gonzalez, Verna; Galvez-Mozo, Ana] Univ Oberta Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain; [Valenzuela-Bustos, Alan] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain",UOC Universitat Oberta de Catalunya; Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Galvez-Mozo, A (corresponding author), Univ Oberta Catalunya, Fac Psychol & Educ Sci, Rambla Poblenou 156, Barcelona 08018, Spain.",agalvez@uoc.edu,"; Galvez Mozo, Ana/Q-4412-2017","Alcalde Gonzalez, Verna/0000-0003-1058-6458; Galvez Mozo, Ana/0000-0003-4195-4823",Universitat Oberta de Catalunya,Universitat Oberta de Catalunya,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by a doctoral grant from the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya.",,39,0,0,0,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,,,,,,,,,,,1.46144E+16,10.1177/14614448221097891,0,,44713,18,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,2B3KD,,,,,44885,WOS:000810089500001,0

Based on the gamification of work, the application linked individualized rewards with Uber's need to maintain a frictionless marketplace. However, as recent studies of gig economy have revealed, workers resist gamified algorithmic management by developing work games. Our findings, based upon analysis of driver accounts of using Uber's application, presents a typology of player modes and work games that drivers play. We identified two distinctive player modes, grinding and oppositional play, which, respectively, illustrate how drivers consent and resist gamification. We also describe several work games that Uber drivers play in resistance to Uber's gamification.

Consequently, some individuals have developed the habit of being permanently connected with others through digital media. This article examines the psychological and political consequences of permanent connectedness. Analysis of two independent sets of data collected via a two-wave panel survey and an online experiment reveals that, over time, permanent connection-the behavior of constantly engaging in mediated communication-increased the perception of permanent togetherness with others, which I label as permanently connected perception. This perception was in turn positively associated with news sharing through the belief that information one shares online can instantly be received and responded to by online contacts as it is shared. Findings emphasize the spillover influence of permanent connectedness, in which perpetual mediated communication encourages political behavior, news sharing, and the role of the permanently connected perception in mediating this process.","[Lee, Sigi S.] Pusan Natl Univ, Dept Media & Commun, 2 Busandaehak Ro 63Beon-gil, Busan 46241, South Korea",Pusan National University,"Lee, SS (corresponding author), Pusan Natl Univ, Dept Media & Commun, 2 Busandaehak Ro 63Beon-gil, Busan 46241, South Korea.",sg.lee@pusan.ac.kr,"Lee, Slgi Sage/AAL-6133-2021","Lee, Slgi Sage/0000-0001-5525-7936",Marsh Center for the Study of Journalistic Performance and Rackham Graduate School at the University of Michigan,Marsh Center for the Study of Journalistic Performance and Rackham Graduate School at the University of Michigan,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by research grants from the Marsh Center for the Study of Journalistic Performance and Rackham Graduate School at the University of Michigan.",,66,0,0,5,11,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,,,,,,,,,,,1.46144E+16,10.1177/14614448211063466,0,,44562,20,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,YQ5TO,,,,,44885,WOS:000749371900001,0

Findings show audiences expect journalists to embody established, normative journalistic values, largely excluding content creators from this field. Audiences' expectations of content creators reveal a more nuanced picture, which includes expectations of authenticity and transparency, engagement, and quality, slow content. Interpreted against broader debates in journalism, we argue that they reveal implicitly journalistic values and expectations, thus blurring normative boundary distinctions. Furthermore, audiences feel an increase in market orientation among both journalists and content creators leads to lower connection and perceptions of credibility, thus further disrupting boundaries.","[Banjac, Sandra; Hanusch, Folker] Univ Vienna, Dept Commun, Wahringer Str 29, A-1090 Vienna, Austria",University of Vienna,"Banjac, S (corresponding author), Univ Vienna, Dept Commun, Wahringer Str 29, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.",sandra.banjac@univie.ac.at,,"Banjac, Sandra/0000-0001-5860-1675; Hanusch, Folker/0000-0002-7344-0483",,,,,61,12,12,7,28,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,MAR,2022,24,3,,,,,705,723,1.46144E+15,10.1177/1461444820963795,0,,44105,19,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,ZI5GO,,hybrid,,,44885,WOS:000583660300001,0

The entanglement of emotion recognition and autism research shows how disability has been transformed into a rhetorical, conceptual, and material resource for the expansion of surveillance capitalism. This history has also underwritten a larger reconceptualization of emotional data, from a neglected variable in human-computer interaction to an exploitable corporate asset, a transformation that has allowed platform users' emotional lives to be mined for new forms of knowledge, value, and power.","[Nagy, Jeff] Stanford Univ, Dept Commun, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University,"Nagy, J (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Commun, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",jsnagy@stanford.edu,,,,,,,79,0,0,6,6,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1177/14614448221109550,0,,44743,19,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,2Y3XM,,,,,44885,WOS:000825834400001,0

We need to examine how the performative logic that this ecosystem forces into platforms accommodates certain emotional claims to ordinariness and normative-moral claims to advocacy-who is (un)worthy of a place in the victimized people that celebrities should advocate for. The article does so by analyzing two paradigmatically different case studies: Lady Gaga's legacy-status and Greta Thunberg's influencer-style performances of celebrity advocacy on Instagram.

Through an analysis of Hebrew Wikipedia's deletion discussion pages-in which editors decide what information should be excluded from Wikipedia-I demonstrate how national ideology customarily triumphs over the global, communitarian ethos of the Wikipedia project. Even when decisions are aligned with a more global agenda, editors still portray their choices as congruent with the national cause through strategic use of depersonalized discourses about Wikipedia's policies.

Using the collective effort model and heuristics of social influence, this study examines the influence of streamer and viewer behaviors on viewers' participation and financial commitment on the SLSS, Twitch.tv. Findings from behavioral data collected over 7 weeks show larger audiences diminish individual participation and financial commitment while moderation may encourage more. Female streamers benefit from increased moderation, earning two to three times more in financial commitment compared to men, who streamed more frequently and for longer durations but attracted much smaller audiences. Viewers' participation and financial commitment did not differ across streams with more content diversity.

I argue that by becoming gatekeepers, these fans gain unlimited social capital and use it to control the content seen by the rest of the /r/bangtan community, much like a traditional news gatekeeper. Doing so controls what BTS content /r/bangtan users will continue to interact with, perceive, and further spread along this East-West flow.

However, Mobileye is neither an automotive manufacturer, nor a nominal 'big tech' company, but an established maker of 'bolt-on' advanced driver assist systems (ADAS), able to draw on over 65 million vehicles. Through these devices, Mobileye is undertaking a 'platformisation', transforming from an automotive supplier into a provider of autonomous vehicle (AV) platforms. We characterise this as a 'car-agnostic' approach to autonomous driving. Mobileye represents the advancement, and modulation, of a platform logic into a different type of hardware: the car. To understand the implications of this, we argue that Mobileye acts parasitically in three ways: by inserting itself between driver and vehicle, vehicle manufacturer and vehicle data, and specific vehicles and the emerging AV industry.","[Hind, Sam] Univ Siegen, SFB1187 Media Cooperat, Siegen, Germany; [Gekker, Alex] Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Commun, Tel Aviv, Israel",Universitat Siegen; Tel Aviv University,"Gekker, A (corresponding author), Tel Aviv Univ, Gershon H Gordon Fac Social Sci, Naftali Bldg,Room 702, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel.",gekker@tauex.tau.ac.il,,"Hind, Sam/0000-0001-8347-3695; Gekker, Alex/0000-0001-6042-2086","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) [262513311 -SFB 1187]","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation)(German Research Foundation (DFG))","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) -Project-ID 262513311 -SFB 1187.",,76,0,0,0,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1177/14614448221104209,0,,44743,21,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,2X2GO,,hybrid,,,44885,WOS:000825028400001,0

We separate two horizons of algorithmic relations - the instrumental and the intimate - and analyse how they shape different dimensions of autonomous agency. Against the instrumental horizon, algorithmic systems are technical procedures ordering social life at a distance and using rules that can only partly be known. Autonomy is activated as reflective and informed choice and the ability to enact one's goals and values amid technological constraints. Meanwhile, the intimate horizon highlights affective aspects of autonomy in relation to algorithmic systems as they creep ever closer to our minds and bodies. Here, quests for autonomy arise from disturbance and comfort in a position of vulnerability. We argue that the dimensions of autonomy guide us towards issues of specific ethical and political importance, given that autonomy is never merely a theoretical concern, but also a public value.","[Savolainen, Laura; Ruckenstein, Minna] Univ Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland",University of Helsinki,"Savolainen, L (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Ctr Consumer Soc Res, POB 24, Helsinki 00014, Finland.",laura.savolainen@helsinki.fi,,"Savolainen, Laura/0000-0002-5979-1607",Academy of Finland [332993],Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the Academy of Finland (grant number 332993).",,73,1,1,10,10,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,,,,,,,,,,,1.46144E+16,10.1177/14614448221100802,0,,44713,19,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,2D7II,,hybrid,,,44885,WOS:000811715400001,0

Data-intensive companies are thus seeking other ways to meet their data needs. This article explores one of these: the creation of synthetic data, or data produced artificially as an alternative to real-world data. I show that capital is already heavily invested in synthetic data. I argue that its appeal goes beyond circumventing surveillance to accord with a structural tendency within capitalism toward the autonomization of the circuit of capital. By severing data from human subjectivity, synthetic data contributes to the automation of the production of automation technologies like machine learning. A shift from surveillance to synthesis, I argue, has epistemological, ontological, and political economic consequences for a society increasingly structured around data-intensive capital.","[Steinhoff, James] Univ Toronto Mississauga, Inst Commun Culture Informat & Technol, Mississauga, ON, Canada",University of Toronto; University Toronto Mississauga,"Steinhoff, J (corresponding author), Univ Toronto Mississauga, Inst Commun Culture Informat & Technol, Mississauga, ON, Canada.",jsteinh@uwo.ca,,"Steinhoff, James/0000-0001-5145-4932",Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [756-2021-0520],Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada Grant 756-2021-0520.",,91,0,0,2,2,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,,,,,,,,,,,1.46144E+16,10.1177/14614448221099217,0,,44713,17,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,2D5SN,,hybrid,,,44885,WOS:000811606700001,0

It identifies three facets of carceral communication to demonstrate how and why mass incarceration is a communicative phenomenon. First, computer-mediated communication (CMC) has become the most sought-after type of criminal evidence because of its visibility and permanence. Second, law enforcement uses the interpersonal communication and neighborhood networks of incarcerated Black men for crime control and surveillance purposes. Third, carceral communication operates as a communication feedback process, in which marginalized, young, Black men under surveillance know they are being watched and respond to that surveillance with resistance that is also subject to criminalization.","[Lane, Jeffrey] Rutgers State Univ, Sch Commun & Informat, New Brunswick, NJ USA; [Ramirez, Fanny A.] Louisiana State Univ, Manship Sch Mass Commun, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Ramirez, Fanny A.] Louisiana State Univ, LSUs Interdisciplinary Ctr Computat & Technol, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA",Rutgers State University New Brunswick; Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University; Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University,"Lane, J (corresponding author), Rutgers State Univ, Dept Commun, 4 Huntington St, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA.",jeffrey.lane@rutgers.edu,,"Lane, Jeffrey/0000-0002-2369-1700",,,,,70,0,0,4,4,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,,,,,,,,,,,1.46144E+16,10.1177/14614448211060841,0,,44682,18,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,1N2JS,,,,,44885,WOS:000800488100001,0

We develop a cognitive model using the constructs of anthropomorphism and explainability to explain user experiences with conversational journalism (CJ) in the context of chatbot news. We examine how users perceive anthropomorphic and explanatory cues, and how these stimuli influence user perception of and attitudes toward CJ. Anthropomorphic explanations of why and how certain items are recommended afford users a sense of humanness, which then affects trust and emotional assurance. Perceived humanness triggers a two-step flow of interaction by defining the baseline to make a judgment about the qualities of CJ and by affording the capacity to interact with chatbots concerning their intention to interact with chatbots. We develop practical implications relevant to chatbots and ascertain the significance of humanness as a social cue in CJ. We offer a theoretical lens through which to characterize humanness as a key mechanism of human-artificial intelligence (AI) interaction, of which the eventual goal is humans perceive AI as human beings. Our results help to better understand human-chatbot interaction in CJ by illustrating how humans interact with chatbots and explaining why humans accept the way of CJ.","[Shin, Donghee] Zayed Univ, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates",Zayed University,"Shin, D (corresponding author), Zayed Univ, Coll Commun & Media Sci, POB 144534, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates.",don.shin@zu.ac.ae,"Shin, Don/T-3545-2019","Shin, Don/0000-0002-5439-4493",Research Office of Zayed University [R20082/2020]; Center for Educational Innovation of ZU; Teaching Innovation Research Fund [TIRF-S19-01: B19053]; Start-Up Grant [R19032],Research Office of Zayed University; Center for Educational Innovation of ZU; Teaching Innovation Research Fund; Start-Up Grant,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This project has been funded by the Research Office of Zayed University, Research Incentive Fund (R20082/2020).

Perceived infringement on an overwhelmingly masculine space pushes women to the margins of online team-based games, where gender norms inform the presumption that they play supportive roles that are viewed as passive and unskilled rather than actively contributing to team objectives. This study explores why women continue to play these roles, even as they are belittled, how societal expectations of women translate to the gaming space, and consequences for gender as a social structure. Findings suggest similarities to gendered labor in that women report feeling obligated to shoulder tasks that nobody else desires, much in the same way that professional work characterized as feminine is devalued. In addition, women must perform emotion work as they game by hiding their role preferences, feeling shame at fulfilling harmful gender stereotypes, and justifying their utility.","[Austin, Jessica] Univ Colorado Boulder, Sociol, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Austin, J (corresponding author), Univ Colorado Boulder, Dept Sociol, UCB 327 Ketchum 195, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",jess.austin@colorado.edu,,"Austin, Jessica/0000-0003-1622-0529",,,,,76,0,0,3,14,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,MAY,2022,24,5,,,,,1116,1132,1.46144E+15,10.1177/1461444820972396,0,,44136,17,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,0V9EV,,,,,44885,WOS:000624237700001,0

Thus, to illuminate the factors of young bystanders' intervention, we conducted a nationwide, quota-based, quantitative online survey of 1180 young adults in Germany. Among the results, perceived personal responsibility for combating online hate speech positively predicted online bystanders' direct and indirect intervention. Moreover, frequent exposure to online hate speech was positively associated with bystander intervention, whereas, a perceived threat or low self-efficacy reduced the likelihood of intervention. Also, a greater acceptance of negative consequences and being educated about online hate speech through peers or campaigns all positively predicted some direct and indirect forms of online bystander intervention.","[Obermaier, Magdalena] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Media & Commun, Oettingenstr 67, D-80538 Munich, Germany",University of Munich,"Obermaier, M (corresponding author), Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Media & Commun, Oettingenstr 67, D-80538 Munich, Germany.",obermaier@ifkw.lmu.de,,,,,,,62,0,0,3,3,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1177/14614448221125417,0,,44835,23,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,5D7TP,,hybrid,,,44885,WOS:000865140800001,0

Despite paid workers making more contributions, volunteers play a significant role. We find which firms contribute most, which projects benefit from firm investments, and identify distinct 'contribution territories' since the two central firms never co-contribute to top-20 repositories.

Furthermore, this study explores tensions present in differing intentions for the NBA Top Shot platform and Discord server, the diffuse nature of user conversations (a nature that disregards topical boundaries), and audience attention toward marketization and investment interests. The commodification of the NBA fan experience illustrates a shared social pressure to more readily think of one's life, interactions, and consumptive behaviors through the lens of the investor, fostering financial attitudes that normalize instability and encourage risk-taking beyond the scope of a platform where purchase-dependent interactions serve as a source of joy and social experience in a venue representing a perceived electronic gold rush.","[Zaucha, Trevor; Agur, Colin] Univ Minnesota Twin Cities, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Zaucha, T (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota Twin Cities, Hubbard Sch Journalism & Mass Commun, 206 Church St,SE 111, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",zauch007@umn.edu,,"Agur, Colin/0000-0003-0799-6691; Zaucha, Trevor/0000-0002-9974-0986",,,,,49,1,1,50,60,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,,,,,,,,,,,1.46144E+16,10.1177/14614448221080481,0,,44621,22,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,0L8FJ,,hybrid,,,44885,WOS:000781703500001,0

The decrease in trust a source (media outlet or individual) suffers when sharing one fake news story against a background of real news is larger than the increase in trust a source enjoys when sharing one real news story against a background of fake news. A comparison with real-world media outlets showed that only sources sharing no fake news at all had similar trust ratings to mainstream media.

Using a pre-registered experiment on a diverse sample of 1079 US respondents, we find that the young, those with low information literacy, and those with high trust in government tend to hold mistaken beliefs, even without exposure to misinformation. Because these groups are already misinformed, eventual exposure to fake news does little to influence their misperceptions. Instead, misinformation exposure affects the elderly, those with high information literacy, and those with low trust in mainstream media the most.

Empirically, we analyze 20 years of discussion on the White Power forum Stormfront, employing natural language processing to study discursive evolution as members become socialized into the community. Our findings suggest that digital media provide space for conversational rituals that instill in people a sense of social membership and intersubjectivity, contained in the elaboration of a shared discourse, within which certain beliefs become sacred and unquestionable.

While the overall homogeneity is low, politicians of the AfD-a right-wing populist party-stand out with very homogeneous follower networks. These are largely driven by a small group of strongly committed partisans that make up around 7% of the party's but around 55-75% of the average AfD politician's followers. The findings add to the literature by showing potentially unequal distributions of network segregation on Twitter. Furthermore, they suggest that small groups of active users can multiply their influence online, which has important implications for future research on echo chambers and other online phenomena.","[Rusche, Felix] Univ Mannheim, Grad Sch Econ & Social Sci GESS, Mannheim, Germany",University of Mannheim,"Rusche, F (corresponding author), Univ Mannheim, Dept Econ, L7 3-5, D-6816 Mannheim, Germany.",felix.rusche@gess.uni-mannheim.de,,"Rusche, Felix/0000-0002-3593-583X",German Research Foundation (DFG) [CRC TR 224]; University of Mannheim's Graduate School of Economic and Social Sciences (GESS),German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); University of Mannheim's Graduate School of Economic and Social Sciences (GESS),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Financial support by the German Research Foundation (DFG) through CRC TR 224 (project A04) and by the University of Mannheim's Graduate School of Economic and Social Sciences (GESS) is gratefully acknowledged.",,77,0,0,3,3,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,,,,,,,,,,,1.46144E+16,10.1177/14614448221099860,0,,44713,27,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,2G4YA,,"hybrid, Green Published",,,44885,WOS:000813601200001,0

Answers to this question are vital and urgent, particularly in view of growing anti-Asian hate crimes amid the current pandemic. Motivated to address this question, we draw insights from the transactional model of stress and coping, the situational theory of problem solving (STOPS), and social media activism literature. We propose an integrative model that delineates the psychological antecedents and processes leading Asian Americans to cope with racial discrimination and engage in social media activism. Results of an online survey among 400 Asian Americans supported the proposed model, highlighting a perception-motivation-coping-activism effect chain. Our study advances the three bodies of literature-coping, STOPS, and social media activism-in the context of racial discrimination concerning an understudied minority group: Asian Americans.

Drawing on interview and focus group data, I explore four ways that right-time memories are sociotechnically produced and felt in everyday life: through an anniversary logic, personalisation, rhythms, and tensions.

Drawing on Cammaert's notion of the mediation opportunity structure, we investigate the mediation process of a feminist data campaign and activists' communicative practices in contemporary China. By practicing data-activist research, our study shows that the data-based action repertoire opens up hybrid and contingent mediation opportunities for an anti-sexual violence campaign under the current political opportunity structure. We find the paradox of seeking visibility while refusing mainstream media coverage in activist tactics, which embodies a form of adaptive and resilient feminist data activism in the authoritarian context of China. This case study suggests that the dynamics of feminist data activism in China are configured by the tripartite interaction among the disruptive action repertoire, mediation opportunity structure, and political conditions.","[Sun, Yu] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Media & Int Culture, Yuhangtang Rd 866, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Yin, Siyuan] Simon Fraser Univ, Sch Commun, Burnaby, BC, Canada",Zhejiang University; Simon Fraser University,"Sun, Y (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ, Coll Media & Int Culture, Yuhangtang Rd 866, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",celinasunyu@gmail.com,,"Sun, Yu/0000-0001-7319-8933",National Social Science Fund of China [19AXW007],National Social Science Fund of China,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Funding National Social Science Fund of China (Grant No.19AXW007).",,46,0,0,6,6,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,,,,,,,,,,,1.46144E+16,10.1177/14614448221096806,0,,44713,21,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,1Y4GM,,,,,44885,WOS:000808099900001,0

Building on research into political social identities which suggests polarizing effects of the latter, interaction effects of users' ideological identities and exposure to opinions on SNS were additionally investigated.

In this article, we look at representativeness and face-ism in search engine image results. We systematically queried four search engines (Google, Bing, Baidu, Yandex) from three locations, using two browsers and in two waves, with gender-neutral (person, intelligent person) and gendered (woman, intelligent woman, man, intelligent man) terminology, accessing the top 100 image results. We employed automatic identification for the individual's gender expression (female/male) and the calculation of the face-to-body ratio of individuals depicted. We find that, as in other forms of media, search engine images perpetuate biases to the detriment of women, confirming the existence of the representation and face-ism biases.

Building on the notions of 'digital democratic affordance' and 'cross-platform play', this article uniquely theorises political consumerism as a multi-scalar mode of human-non-human interactions. The concept of multi-scalar cross-platform affordances is formulated to demonstrate how different digital platforms - large or small, corporate or amateur, global or local - co-constitute an environment in which citizens are progressively channelled to engage in multiple platforms, reinvent them in concert with one another and participate in political consumption across time and space. In the case of the Yellow Economic Circle, against the backdrop of Hong Kong's 2019-2020 Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill (Anti-ELAB) movement, we examine such cross-platform dynamics and their multi-scalar enactment of everyday political consumption practices across four stages: deliberation, crowdsourcing, materialisation and habituation.","[Poon, Hannah; Tse, Tommy] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam,"Poon, H (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Media Studies Dept, Turfdraagsterpad 9, NL-1012 XT Amsterdam, Netherlands.",hannahpoon.phl@gmail.com,,"Poon, Hannah Hiu Lam/0000-0001-6131-0756",,,,,69,1,1,3,3,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,,,,,,,,,,,1.46144E+16,10.1177/14614448221097305,0,,44713,21,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,2B3IH,,hybrid,,,44885,WOS:000810084700001,0

The app serves as an ideal case for examining the socio-cultural negotiations involved in re-contextualising algorithmic technology. We conducted in-depth interviews with parents, medical practitioners and data experts in Nigeria; the interviews reveal individuals' perceptions about algorithmic governance and self-determination. In particular, our study presents people's insights about (1) relocated algorithms as socially dynamic 'contextual settings', (2) the (non)negotiable spaces that these algorithmic solutions potentially create and (3) the general implications of re-contextualising algorithmic governance.

These studies, however, have left unexplored the agency, temporality, and spatial considerations that underpin why workers prefer to activate informal mechanisms of complaint rather than accessing formal channels of redress, such as the Fair Work Ombudsman or labor unions. Using Working Holiday Makers in Australia as an example, this article focuses on digital togetherness generated through new media. I argue that digital interactions on new media platforms not only change the spatial-temporal limit of temporary migrant workers, but also create digital togetherness and connect workers with different imagined others (customers, arriving migrant workers, and workers who are facing exploitation). This connection can become an everyday resistance strategy, a remedy to space-time limits, and potentially challenge asymmetrical power relations between workers and employers.","[Li, Yao-Tai] Univ New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney,"Li, YT (corresponding author), Univ New South Wales, Sch Social Sci, Morven Brown Bldg, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",yaotai.li@unsw.edu.au,"Li, Yao-Tai/AAF-2988-2021","Li, Yao-Tai/0000-0002-4897-3616",,,,,68,0,0,8,15,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,,,,,,,,,,,1.46144E+16,10.1177/14614448221080717,0,,44593,20,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,ZK9DJ,,,,,44885,WOS:000763282300001,0

Filtering entails both enhancement and subtraction: some feminist sensibilities align with Instagram's interaction order, while others become subdued and remain at the margins of visibility. Taken together, users' filtering practices contribute to the confident and happy image, individualistic streak, and accommodationist cast of popular feminism, while also amplifying feminist politics that affirm the pleasures of visibility and desire. Instagram proves a more challenging environment for feminists seeking to criticize competitive individualism and aesthetic norms. The notion of filtering enriches existing research on how online environments reconfigure feminist politics and problematizes the avowal of feminism in media culture.","[Savolainen, Laura] Univ Helsinki, Consumer Soc Res Ctr, Helsinki, Finland; [Uitermark, Justus] Univ Amsterdam, Urban Geog, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Boy, John D.] Leiden Univ, Sociol, Leiden, Netherlands",University of Helsinki; University of Amsterdam; Leiden University; Leiden University - Excl LUMC,"Savolainen, L (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, POB 24,Unioninkatu 40, Helsinki 00014, Finland.",laura.savolainen@helsinki.fi,,"Boy, John/0000-0003-2118-4702; Uitermark, Justus/0000-0002-5274-1455",European Union [732942],European Union(European Commission),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: We gratefully acknowledge funding from the ODYCCEUS project, financed through the European Union's Horizon 2020 program (grant agreement no. 732942).",,51,9,9,11,47,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,MAR,2022,24,3,,,,,557,579,1.46144E+15,10.1177/1461444820960074,0,,44105,23,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,ZI5GO,,"Green Published, hybrid",,,44885,WOS:000580951200001,0

Unlike prior studies, which have relied on cross-sectional data to examine this link, we used two panel data sets to better identify causal relationships. Specifically, we evaluate two unidirectional models (i.e. mobilization and reinforcement) and a reciprocal causal model using both cross-lagged and autoregressive path models. The findings reveal a more complex relationship than most previous studies have suggested. The relationship between incidental news exposure via social media and political participation appears to be reciprocal, with incidental news exposure and political participation indirectly influencing each other through social media use for political purposes. Furthermore, while the relationship between incidental news exposure and political participation is reciprocal, the participation-to-incidental news exposure path exerted a stronger effect than the reverse path in both studies.","[Lee, Sangwon] New Mexico State Univ, Dept Commun Studies, 1405 Int Dr, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA; [Xenos, Michael] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Dept Life Sci Commun, Madison, WI USA; [Xenos, Michael] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Dept Commun Arts, Commun Sci, Madison, WI USA",New Mexico State University; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Lee, S (corresponding author), New Mexico State Univ, Dept Commun Studies, 1405 Int Dr, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA.",optimis314@gmail.com,,,,,,,48,17,17,8,29,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,JAN,2022,24,1,,,,,178,201,1.46144E+15,10.1177/1461444820962121,0,,44105,24,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,YE4EL,,,,,44885,WOS:000578417800001,0

Presenting analysis for three families from Aotearoa New Zealand, this work highlights the importance of the family in creating children's digital disposition. Applying Bourdieu's Theory of Practice concepts, we illustrate how parent's habitus informs children's responses to the digital world, shaping diverse forms of 'digital capital' which may result in 'capital gains' for some, and less capital benefits for others. Findings suggest that the forms of digital capital that are valued by families are closely tied to class positioning and cultural background.","[Keen, Caroline] Social Res NZ, Auckland, New Zealand; [France, Alan] Univ Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand",University of Auckland,"Keen, C (corresponding author), Sociodigital Res Ltd, 91 Centreway Rd, Auckland 0932, New Zealand.",Keenresearch@gmail.com,,,,,,,36,0,0,9,9,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1177/14614448221122228,0,,44805,18,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,4U0KT,,,,,44885,WOS:000858494600001,0

We analyzed their use of aggression and politicized cues, and the relationship with the volume of retweets. Results showed that even though aggressive tweets were a small portion of the overall tweets about climate change, aggressive tweets were more likely to be politicized and retweeted. Specifically, aggressive tweets from politicians received the most retweets and news media amplified the aggression. The findings of this study build upon the current knowledge of the use of aggression online and provide practical implications for environmental communicators.","[Yuan, Shupei; Vojta, Sophia] Northern Illinois Univ, De Kalb, IL 60115 USA; [Chen, Yingying; Chen, Yu] Univ South Carolina, Columbia, SC 29208 USA",Northern Illinois University; University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia,"Chen, YY (corresponding author), Univ South Carolina, Sch Journalism & Mass Commun, 800 Sumter St, Columbia, SC 29208 USA.",yychen@sc.edu,,"Chen, Yingying/0000-0003-4278-8206; Yuan, Shupei/0000-0003-1796-9611",,,,,65,0,0,7,7,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1177/14614448221122202,0,,44805,20,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,4K5WR,,,,,44885,WOS:000852020100001,0

The review showed a paucity of research focused specifically on the use of social media by Service families. Overall, papers returned showed that social media and Internet-based communication has distinct benefits for military families, fostering connectedness, increasing potential communication, enabling Serving parents to be more involved and better accommodate their family's routine, and potentially improving the deployment experience.

These self-branding strategies are contextualized within Goffman's dramaturgical theory and through an affordances lens, showing immanent tensions. While online freelancers successfully leverage self-branding to improve their visibility on Upwork and beyond, the client perspective reveals a fine line between too little and too much self-branding.

Using Dutch survey data (N = 1994), and manual coding and latent class analysis, we explore how types of people formulate search queries about immigration and climate change (RQ1).

I show that even in democracies like the United States and Canada, for individuals along intersecting axes of marginalization (e.g. race, gender), public political acts do not capture the full range of young people's political repertoires.

In particular, we look at the institutions shaping online scams, the labor involved in performing and/or navigating them, and the role of platforms in hosting them.","[Poster, Winifred R.] Washington Univ, 1 Brookings Dr,MC 1064, St Louis, MO 63130 USA",Washington University (WUSTL),"Poster, WR (corresponding author), Washington Univ, 1 Brookings Dr,MC 1064, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.",wrposter@gmail.com,,"Poster, Winifred/0000-0002-2327-8756",,,,,15,0,0,6,6,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,JUL,2022,24,7,,,,,1535,1547,,10.1177/14614448221099232,0,,,13,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,3A7BM,,,,,44885,WOS:000827410900001,0

We employed the computational Analysis of Topic Model Networks (ANTMN) to examine the discourse around the #TaiwanCanHelp/#TWforWHO campaign in 2020 (N = 163,876) on Twitter. Our model identified 35 topics clustered within three frames. The containment frame emphasized strategies used to stop COVID-19's spread in Taiwan. The geopolitics frame described China's use of its international power to exclude Taiwan from the World Health Organization. The international cooperation frame emphasized Taiwan's ability and efficacy to contribute to the global efforts to slow down COVID-19. These results extend our understanding of hashtag activism by examining the intersection of geopolitics and global health crises. We introduce the theoretical concept of a mutually beneficial coalition, one that points to detrimental impacts of oppression on both the oppressed and the allies who are asked to help.","[Liu, Anita K.

High age, low education and a change to living alone predicted a decrease in use. High education predicted the increased Internet use due to COVID-19.

These activities can lead to political consumerism, which is an important and popular form of political participation that translates across geographic borders. This article uses original survey data (n = 9284) to examine the relationship between digital media use and political consumerism in the United States, United Kingdom, and France. Talking politics online, joining social groups on social media, and searching online for political information increase participation in political consumerism. However, the strength of these positive correlations differs by age, country, and mode of political consumerism. Joining social groups on social media has a much larger effect size on buycotting compared to boycotting. The findings imply that social groups are more salient in the mobilization process for buycotting campaigns compared to boycotting campaigns.","[Boulianne, Shelley] MacEwan Univ, Sociol, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Copeland, Lauren] Baldwin Wallace Univ, Polit Sci, Cleveland, OH USA; [Koc-Michalska, Karolina] Audencia Business Sch, Paris, France; [Koc-Michalska, Karolina] Univ Silesia, Fac Social Sci, Katowice, Poland",Baldwin Wallace University; University of Silesia in Katowice,"Boulianne, S (corresponding author), MacEwan Univ, Dept Sociol, 6-394 City Ctr Campus,10700-104 Ave, Edmonton, AB T5J 4S2, Canada.",sjboulianne@gmail.com,,"Koc-Michalska, Karolina/0000-0002-5354-5616",Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) Insight Grant [435-2019-04-94]; Audencia University; Baldwin Wallace University,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) Insight Grant; Audencia University; Baldwin Wallace University,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This project was funded by a Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) Insight Grant (435-2019-04-94), as well as research grants from Audencia University and Baldwin Wallace University.",,53,1,1,15,21,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,,,,,,,,,,,1.46144E+16,10.1177/14614448221083025,0,,44621,21,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,ZZ2KP,,"hybrid, Green Published",,,44885,WOS:000773104200001,0

Two hundred participants from the United Kingdom and Malaysia participated across three experiments, where the appearance and behaviour of video game characters were manipulated with regard to target (enemy) gender (Study 1), sexually explicit attire (Study 2) and level of character agency (Study 3). We found minimal evidence that exposure to gender-stereotyped content resulted in differential gender-related attitudes (implicit associations, hostile and benevolent sexism, or rape myth acceptance). However, Study 1 findings showed that individuals who played a first-person shooter with male enemies showed lower endorsement of some (benevolent) sexist attitudes (cf. control) and showed difference in game behaviour (cf. female enemies). Together, our results suggest that short-term exposure to video games containing female characters (sexualised, passive, or otherwise) does not consistently lead to the endorsement of negative gender attitudes.","[Cross, Liam; Kaye, Linda K.; Savostijanovs, Juris; Atherton, Gray] Edge Hill Univ, Ormskirk, England; [McLatchie, Neil; Johnston, Matthew; Whiteman, Liam] Univ Lancaster, Lancaster, England; [Mooney, Robyn] Univ Derby, Derby, England",Edge Hill University; Lancaster University; University of Derby,"Cross, L (corresponding author), Edge Hill Univ, Dept Psychol, Ormskirk L39 4QP, England.",drliamcross@gmail.com,,"Atherton, Gray/0000-0002-3954-9127; Mooney, Robyn/0000-0001-7956-4535; Kaye, Linda/0000-0001-7687-5071; cross, liam/0000-0002-5122-1650",,,,,47,1,1,11,28,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,,,,,,,,,,,1.46144E+16,10.1177/14614448221075736,0,,44593,22,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,ZE5MW,,"hybrid, Green Published",,,44885,WOS:000758927900001,0

It focuses on one learn-to-code Meetup, finding that attendees are pulled in by the hope embedded in the popular imaginary of coding, particularly the programming language Python, as a way to change their careers. While the gathering's call labels it as a learning space,the study finds teaching happens rarely, instead drawing individuals who seek peers based on a Python affinity, in part to break the side-by-side-but-not together norms of urban mobile work. This paper argues that the hope of individual professional change spills over into the hope of sharing space with programmers and to find local Python community. However, given the porosity of events facilitated by online convening, the gathering falls short of attracting those already pertaining to that community itself.","[Alarcon, Andrea] Univ Southern Calif, Annenberg Sch Commun & Journalism, 3502 Watt Way, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",University of Southern California,"Alarcon, A (corresponding author), Univ Southern Calif, Annenberg Sch Commun & Journalism, 3502 Watt Way, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",alar450@usc.edu,,"Alarcon, Andrea/0000-0003-0413-7234",,,,,57,0,0,0,1,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,,,,,,,,,,,1.46144E+16,10.1177/14614448211072827,0,,44593,17,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,ZE4XI,,,,,44885,WOS:000758887200001,0

Adopting a micro-institutional perspective, the discussion looks at the emerging influence of mobile technology on refugee women's precarious norms related to mobility and work, and the evolution of new digital norms. The article highlights the strategic role of women's groups and proactive group members as 'institutional entrepreneurs', in aiding levels of ICT adoption among group members, motivated by connection, protection and collective enterprise, with potential effects far beyond the group.

While research on gacha games - and the specific role of loot boxes therein - has emphasised their associations with gambling, I contend that affect is another trigger that can motivate seemingly irrational playing behaviours. The affective embeddings of gacha games motivate players to curate aesthetic assemblages of virtual content that enable the mediated expression of the self. Drawing on qualitative data generated among young Singapore-based players of gacha games, I explore how the acquisition of characters, skins and collections can be motivated by the emotional payoff that comes from relationality rather than gambling.","[Woods, Orlando] Singapore Management Univ, Humanities, Singapore, Singapore",Singapore Management University,"Woods, O (corresponding author), Singapore Management Univ, Sch Social Sci, 90 Stamford Rd, Singapore 178903, Singapore.",orlandowoods@smu.edu.sg,,"Woods, Orlando/0000-0001-9218-1264","Lee Kong Chian Fellowship, Singapore Management University","Lee Kong Chian Fellowship, Singapore Management University","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the Lee Kong Chian Fellowship, Singapore Management University.",,41,4,4,14,38,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,,,,,,,,,,,1.46144E+16,10.1177/14614448211067756,0,,44562,16,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,YE2QX,,,,,44885,WOS:000740975900001,0

Drawing on a US case study, I argue that the lack of a standardized federal policy has led to the creation of myriad digital memory holes of varying porosities. I show that, when systematically drafted and deployed, research based on the US Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) can serve as a generative method of unearthing deleted tweets and memory narratives that might otherwise be inaccessible. Finally, I build on the US case study by offering pathways for other new media scholars to examine and trace tweeting and deleting by government employees in other jurisdictions.","[McCammon, Muira] Univ Penn, Annenberg Sch Commun, 3620 Walnut St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania,"McCammon, M (corresponding author), Univ Penn, Annenberg Sch Commun, 3620 Walnut St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",muira.mccammon@asc.upenn.edu,,,,,,,47,6,6,6,20,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,MAR,2022,24,3,,,,,741,759,1.46144E+15,10.1177/1461444820934034,0,,44013,19,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,ZI5GO,,,,,44885,WOS:000551149200001,0

While past research has focused on their role in corporate communication, studies largely ignored how public organizations use social media. Among these, the police are a particularly relevant case due to their responsibilities in society. Using a sequential mixed-methods design that combines qualitative interviews with an automated content analysis, this study analyzes how the German police use social media during community (e.g. mass shootings) and organizational-level crises (e.g. misdemeanors within the police). The results demonstrate that Twitter and Facebook are the primary platforms for crisis communication, with their unique affordances shaping the communicative styles of the police. We also find police communication strategies to differ between the two crisis types.

Findings show that the inflated visibility of anti-governmental opinions in the manipulated comment space was incongruent with the overall political tone that general users had spontaneously encountered from the broader media ecosystem beyond the manipulated space. Subsequently, this opinion climate incongruence decreased the likelihood of commenting in the manipulated space. The study concludes that false amplification (of the opinions that the manipulators promote) and false diminution (of general users' political expressions) work in tandem to create a distorted opinion environment.","[Kwon, K.

Unique methods of postdigital critical discourse analysis are developed to map a corpus of 20 British magazine, tabloid and broadsheet newspaper articles, which are the jumping-off point to intertextual references to television, film and earlier Oriental narratives.

By critically discussing both opportunities and shortcomings of how European PSM organisations developed their online services and personalisation systems, we argue that in their own platformisation processes, PSM have partially lost their distinctiveness and have not been able to provide viable alternatives to the dominant audiovisual media platforms. Thus, building on Mouffe's agonistic theory and Illich's conviviality theory, this article proposes a theoretical framework to radically rethink the guiding principles and rationales driving public service platforms, in order to develop viable alternatives to the currently dominant models. By doing so, we envision the development of such services as convivial tools that are based on three principles, namely, symmetry of power (intended as hackability, openness and algorithmic conviviality), independence and environmental sustainability.","[Bonini, Tiziano] Univ Siena, Dept Social Polit & Cognit Sci, Sociol Media & Culture, Siena, Italy; [Mazzoli, Eleonora Maria] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London, England",University of Siena; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Bonini, T (corresponding author), Univ Siena, Dept Social Polit & Cognit Sci, Via Roma 56, I-53100 Siena, Italy.",tiziano.bonini@unisi.it,,"Bonini, Tiziano/0000-0002-0636-0555",,,,,85,1,1,1,10,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,APR,2022,24,4,,,SI,,922,941,1.46144E+16,10.1177/14614448221079036,0,,44652,20,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,0K7YW,,"Green Accepted, hybrid",,,44885,WOS:000781701500001,0

Where in the mid-2000s SNSs relied heavily on a rhetoric of sharing to promote their services, by 2020, this rhetoric had been almost entirely dropped. The research reported here implies that social media platforms no longer feel a need or desire to be associated with these cultural beliefs.

But there remains a gap in our knowledge with respect to the impact of social media on the capacity of Indigenous actors to engage in frame competition in the virtual world. Based on a comparative frame analysis of online content in three Latin American countries where Indigenous organizations have recently engaged in large-scale protest, we ask to what extent the frames generated by Indigenous actors on social media are reflected in the online public sphere. We examine how their protest action is framed by Indigenous organizations themselves, the media, and government agencies. We find that social media do provide an outlet for Indigenous actors to disseminate counter-hegemonic frames.

We propose the concept of subverted agency to emphasize that use of digital technologies may be personally empowering but might reinforce normative regimes contributing to sociostructural marginalization. We investigated digital practices of 17 online-soliciting transfeminine sex workers through semi-structured interviews in Singapore, where attitudes toward gender diversity and sex work remain conservative. We highlight three dilemmas of digital media environments, namely, presentation of gender identity and embodiment, intimate relationships characterized by persistent liminality, and competitive pressures related to authenticity of identity. The subverted agency perspective suggests that digital practices do not straightforwardly transform unequal sociostructural conditions; instead, it offers a frame to rethink inclusion by attending to contextual intersections of marginalization.","[Chib, Arul; Ang, Ming Wei] Nanyang Technol Univ, Wee Kim Wee Sch Commun & Informat, 31 Nanyang Link,WKWSCI Bldg 03-08, Singapore 637718, Singapore; [Chib, Arul] Nanyang Technol Univ, Singapore Internet Res Ctr, Singapore, Singapore; [Ang, Ming Wei] Nanyang Technol Univ, Grad Coll, Singapore, Singapore; [Zheng, Yingqin] Royal Holloway Univ London, Sch Management, London, England; [Nguyen, Sarah Hoan] Univ Southern Calif, Annenberg Sch Commun & Journalism, Los Angeles, CA USA",Nanyang Technological University & National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore; Nanyang Technological University; Nanyang Technological University & National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore; Nanyang Technological University; Nanyang Technological University & National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore; Nanyang Technological University; University of London; Royal Holloway University London; University of Southern California,"Chib, A (corresponding author), Nanyang Technol Univ, Wee Kim Wee Sch Commun & Informat, 31 Nanyang Link,WKWSCI Bldg 03-08, Singapore 637718, Singapore.",arulchib@ntu.edu.sg,,"Chib, Arul/0000-0002-3833-8889; Ang, Ming Wei/0000-0001-5929-5163","Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information, Nanyang Technological University","Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information, Nanyang Technological University(Nanyang Technological University)","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The study was funded by a grant from Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information, Nanyang Technological University.",,72,0,0,1,6,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,FEB,2022,24,2,,,SI,,458,477,,10.1177/14614448211063181,0,,,20,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,YX7ZK,,,,,44885,WOS:000754316300011,0

This ethnographic study pays close attention to the cultivation of community through Facebook groups, the utilization of groups and event pages to organize, and the affordances and challenges of moving online efforts offline. At the same time, this article explores tensions and contradictions of these digital spaces that may involve issues like the lack of resources and the fragmentation of community-and of communal space-by such variables as age, language, and technological access and literacy.

More, recent research has yielded mixed empirical support. This study investigates how dimensions of psychological presence-perceived self-location, sense of copresence, and judgments of social realism-mediate the effect of immersion on cognitive, affective, and associative empathy. Findings indicate that experiencing a news story via 360 degrees video on a head-mounted display led to stronger self-location and copresence than engaging with the same video via desktop or reading a text version.

Whereas self-location and copresence enhanced associative empathy, social realism decreased it.

In the following study, we analyzed whether transparency about the application of open data promotes trust. Furthermore, we formulated guidelines on how to create transparency regarding open data in an ethical way. Using an open-data-based fictitious smart city app, we conducted an experiment analyzing to what extent communication of the technical open data application process and the ethical self-commitment for the transparent communication of data application affect trust in the app's provider. The results indicate that the more information users obtain regarding the use of open data, the more trustworthy they perceive the app provider to be, and the more likely they are to use the app.","[Wiencierz, Christian] Univ Munster, Munster, Germany; [Luenich, Marco] Univ Dusseldorf, Dusseldorf, Germany",University of Munster; Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf,"Wiencierz, C (corresponding author), Univ Munster, REACH EUREGIO Start Up Ctr, Geiststr 24-26, D-48151 Munster, Germany.",christian.wiencierz@uni-muenster.de,,"Lunich, Marco/0000-0002-0553-7291",German Society for Online Research,German Society for Online Research,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research is funded by the German Society for Online Research.",,55,2,2,4,20,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,AUG,2022,24,8,,,,,1751,1770,1.46144E+15,10.1177/1461444820979708,0,,44166,20,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,3E5BM,,hybrid,,,44885,WOS:000624864900001,0

In this study, we examine when, how, and why journalists practice proactive ephemerality, deleting their tweets either manually or automatically to consider the viability of social media as a public record. Based on interviews conducted with journalists in New York City, we find many journalists delete their tweets, and that software-aided mass deletion is common, damaging Twitter's standing as an archive. Through deletion, journalists manipulate temporality, exposing the public to a brief tweeting window to reduce risks and regain control in a precarious labor market and a harassment-ridden public sphere in which employers leave them largely unprotected. When deleting tweets mechanically, journalists emulate platform logic by depending-as commercial platforms often do-on automatic procedures rather than on human expertise.

Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork and in-depth interviews with live creators and viewers, this study suggests that the affordances of social live streaming platforms create a media and relational environment wherein personal branding practices are belabored by both creators and audiences. This phenomenon, which we term participatory branding, redistributes the labor of personal branding on social media and emphasizes the work of audiences in helping to shape the brand of a creative worker. We then advance a typology that maps the terrain of personal branding on social media as it relates to platform affordances, cross-platform promotion, and audience activity in content creation.","[Meisner, Colten] Cornell Univ, Dept Commun, 495A Mann Lib Bldg, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Ledbetter, Andrew M.] Texas Christian Univ, Dept Commun Studies, Ft Worth, TX 76129 USA",Cornell University; Texas Christian University,"Meisner, C (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Dept Commun, 495A Mann Lib Bldg, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",ccm252@cornell.edu,,,,,,,43,9,9,14,62,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,MAY,2022,24,5,,,,,1179,1195,1.46144E+15,10.1177/1461444820972392,0,,44136,17,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,0V9EV,,,,,44885,WOS:000624213800001,0

They managed this uncertainty in two ways: while some engaged in information seeking, others engaged in information scanning. Those who did not actively seek information did not avoid it either, with some of them finding it impossible to avoid information about COVID-19, as it comes up in their routine social media use and offline conversations. Understanding COVID-19 as an illness that does not threaten young people, our participants noted only minimal disruptions to them. Instead, they were more concerned about their parents and older family members, whom they considered as more vulnerable.","[Tandoc, Edson C., Jr.; Lee, James Chong Boi] Nanyang Technol Univ, Wee Kim Wee Sch Commun & Informat, 31 Nanyang Link, Singapore 637718, Singapore",Nanyang Technological University & National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore; Nanyang Technological University,"Tandoc, EC (corresponding author), Nanyang Technol Univ, Wee Kim Wee Sch Commun & Informat, 31 Nanyang Link, Singapore 637718, Singapore.",edson@ntu.edu.sg,,"Tandoc, Edson/0000-0002-8740-9313; Lee, James/0000-0001-7058-4505",,,,,56,31,31,9,47,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,MAR,2022,24,3,,,,,778,796,1.46144E+15,10.1177/1461444820968212,0,,44105,19,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,ZI5GO,,,,,44885,WOS:000625261200001,0

One IoT device is the smart speaker that is equipped with an integrated assistant controlled by spoken commands. In the global smart speaker market, Chinese brands account for a significant share. Since smart speakers have a natural advantage when collecting user data in diverse scenarios, privacy and personal information protection have become crucial issues for both smart speaker manufacturers and users in China. This paper applies the socio-technical system (STS) framework to portray the technology subsystem, the industry/market subsystem and the regulators, law/regulation subsystem that are related to smart speakers in China, and how they interact with each other. It also uses focus group discussions to understand the smart speaker users' privacy concerns and the smart speaker industry's implementation of personal information protection. By employing the document analysis method, this study analyzes the laws and regulations related to privacy and personal information protection in the context of AI and the IoT. In particular, the potential impacts of the Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL) on smart speakers are discussed in detail. With its goal of balancing personal information protection and technological development, this paper provides recommendations for the regulatory bodies and the smart speaker industry players in China that can shed light on other countries and regions.","[Liu, Yu-li; Huang, Luyan; Yan, Wenjia; Wang, Xinghan; Zhang, Ruochen] City Univ Hong Kong, Run Run Shaw Creat Media Ctr, Dept Media & Commun, Kowloon Tong, 18 Tat Hong Ave, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",City University of Hong Kong,"Yan, WJ (corresponding author), City Univ Hong Kong, Run Run Shaw Creat Media Ctr, Dept Media & Commun, Kowloon Tong, 18 Tat Hong Ave, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",yuliliu@cityu.edu.hk; luyhuang@cityu.edu.hk; wenjiayan4-c@my.cityu.edu.hk; xinghwang6-c@my.cityu.edu.hk; ruoczhang2-c@my.cityu.edu.hk,,"LIU, YU-LI/0000-0002-7852-4678; Yan, Wenjia/0000-0001-6708-2520","City University of Hong Kong [9380125, 7005491]",City University of Hong Kong(City University of Hong Kong),The work described in this paper was partially supported by the grants from City University of Hong Kong (Project No. 9380125 and 7005491) .

At the same time, there is some tentative evidence suggesting that information and communication technology is positively correlated with income inequality. However, whether and how ICT affects wealth inequality is less explored, particularly because of the lack of reliable data on wealth inequality. This paper, therefore, fills this gap and contributes to this new literature by investigating the effect of ICT on wealth inequality in a sample of 45 developed and developing countries over the period 2000-2017. ICT is measured with six different indicators (including internet penetration, mobile penetration, ICT service exports, the ICT index, ICT quality, and ICT quantity), while wealth inequality is measured with three different indicators (comprising billionaire wealth to GDP, the Top 1% wealth share, and the Top 10% wealth share). The empirical analysis is based on the Generalised Method of Moments, and the results show that ICT increases wealth inequality. Furthermore, we show that democracy mitigates the increasing effect of ICT on wealth inequality. This result suggests that improving democracy in both developed and developing countries is an effective mechanism for mitigating the effects of ICT on wealth inequality. Therefore, we encourage efforts to implement democratic institutions that ensure respect for citizens' freedoms, greater democratic accountability, and executive constraints that allow for a more egalitarian distribution of wealth.","[Njangang, Henri] Univ Dschang, Fac Econ & Management, LAREFA, Dschang, Cameroon; [Beleck, Alim] Univ Bamenda, Higher Teacher Training Coll HTTTC, Bamenda, Cameroon; [Tadadjeu, Sosson; Kamguia, Brice] Univ Dschang, Dschang Sch Econ & Management, LAREFA, Dschang, Cameroon",,"Njangang, H (corresponding author), Univ Dschang, Fac Econ & Management, LAREFA, Dschang, Cameroon.",ndieupahenri@gmail.com; alim.belek@yahoo.fr; stadadjeu@yahoo.fr; bricekamguiadj@yahoo.fr,,"Njangang, Henri/0000-0003-0362-3222",,,,,128,5,5,7,12,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5961,1879-3258,,TELECOMMUN POLICY,Telecommun.

Our database ranges from 2004 to the end of 2020. First, operators' market shares are presented and analysed. Second, we build concentration indexes and other indicators of competitiveness. Finally, we conduct an econometric analysis to determine the extent to which regulatory measures, privatization, market structure and the population dimension determine market shares. Overall, we can argue that, although concentration remains high, the market has become more competitive since the liberalization process began. The statistical analysis and the econometric assessment show that the entrance of the third operator made the market more competitive. Indeed, there is evidence that operator companies competed to capture customers from each other during the period under study. These features suggest that mobile operators did not follow anticompetitive practices in order to restrain competition.","[Amassaghrou, Soumaya] Univ Miguel Hernandez, DEcIDE Doctorate Program, Av Univ S-N,Edificio Torretamarit, Elche, Spain; [Gutierrez-Hita, Carlos] Univ Miguel Hernandez, Ctr Operat Res, Av Univ S-N,Edificio Torretamarit, Elche 03202, Spain; [Gutierrez-Hita, Carlos] Univ Antonio Nebrija, C Sta Cruz de Marcenado 27, Madrid 28015, Spain; [Zhukova, Vita] Univ Catolica San Antonio Murcia, Av Jeronimos 135, Murcia 30107, Spain",Universidad Miguel Hernandez de Elche; Universidad Miguel Hernandez de Elche; Universidad Antonio de Nebrija; Universidad Catolica de Murcia,"Gutierrez-Hita, C (corresponding author), Univ Miguel Hernandez, Ctr Operat Res, Av Univ S-N,Edificio Torretamarit, Elche 03202, Spain.",soumaya@alu.umh.es; cgutierrez@umh.es; vzhukova@ucam.edu,"Gutierrez-Hita, Carlos/F-2762-2017","Gutierrez-Hita, Carlos/0000-0003-3156-1356",Spanish Government - MCIN/AEI [PGC2018-097965-B-100]; European Union Next Generation EU/PRTR; Generalitat Valenciana [PROMETEO/2021/063],Spanish Government - MCIN/AEI; European Union Next Generation EU/PRTR; Generalitat Valenciana(Center for Forestry Research & Experimentation (CIEF)European Commission),"The authors want to thank the comments and suggestions of four anonymous referees.

1973,J,"Winter, JS; Davidson, E",,,,"Winter, Jenifer Sunrise; Davidson, Elizabeth",,,Harmonizing regulatory regimes for the governance of patient-generated health data,TELECOMMUNICATIONS POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Patient-generated health data; PGHD; Governance; Privacy; Big tech; Regulation,BIG-DATA; INNOVATION; POLICY; INFORMATION; PRIVACY; SYSTEMS; AGE,"Patient-generated health data (PGHD), created and captured from patients via wearable devices and mobile apps, are proliferating outside of clinical settings. Examples include sleep trackers, fitness trackers, continuous glucose monitors, and RFID-enabled implants, with many additional biometric or health surveillance applications in development or envisioned. These data are included in growing stockpiles of personal health data (PHI) being mined for insight by health economists, policy analysts, researchers, and health system organizations. Dominant narratives position these highly personal data as valuable resources to transform healthcare, stimulate innovation in medical research, and engage individuals in their health and healthcare. Large tech companies are also increasingly implicated in these areas, through mobile health application sales and data acquisitions. Given the many possible uses and users for PGHD, ensuring privacy, security, and equity of benefits from PGHD will be challenging. This is due in part to disparate regulatory policies and practices across technology firms, health system organizations, and health researchers. Rapid developments with PGHD technologies and the lack of harmonization between regulatory regimes may render existing safeguards to preserve patient privacy and control over their PGHD ineffective, while also failing to guide PGHD-related innovation in socially desirable directions. Using a policy regime lens to explore these challenges, we examine three existing data protection regimes relevant to PGHD in the United States that are currently in tension with one another: federal and state health-sector laws, regulations on data use and reuse for research and innovation, and industry self-regulation of consumer privacy by large tech companies. We argue that harmonization of these regimes is necessary to meet the challenges of PGHD data governance. We next examine emerging governing instruments, identifying three types of structures (organizational, regulatory, technological/algorithmic), which synergistically could help enact needed regulatory oversight while limiting the friction and economic costs of regulation that may hinder innovation. This policy analysis provides a starting point for further discussions and negotiations among stakeholders and regulators to do so.","[Winter, Jenifer Sunrise] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Sch Commun, 2550 Campus Rd,Crawford 325, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Davidson, Elizabeth] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Shidler Coll Business, Dept Informat Technol Management, 2404 Maile Way, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa,"Winter, JS (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, Sch Commun, 2550 Campus Rd,Crawford 325, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",jwinter@hawaii.edu; edavidso@hawaii.edu,,"Davidson, Elizabeth/0000-0002-3989-8677; Winter, Jenifer Sunrise/0000-0002-6393-6637",National Science Foundation [1827592],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant Number 1827592.

We ask respondents about the likelihood they would use three types of personalized advertising services delivered through their mobile operator, with services varying with respect to the level of personal data collected and whether shared with third parties. In all four countries, respondents state that their likelihood of using a personalized ad service decreases when the service uses more personal data or shares the data with third parties. Using a split sample design, we find that introducing a 10% discount on mobile subscriptions for those using the ad service increases the stated likelihood of using the service. We find significant differences in willingness to share personal data attitudes between countries, with respondents in high-income Norway being least willing and those in low-income Pakistan most willing to share personal data. We identify only minor differences between respondents in Serbia and Malaysia, middle-income countries in Europe and Asia. The study contributes to the literature on the willingness to share personal data by including young adult respondents from countries in both Europe and Asia. Furthermore, framing the survey questions in a mobile service context is appreciably closer to telecom reality than most existing experimental studies on sharing of personal data.","[Alfnes, Frode; Wasenden, Ole Christian] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Sch Econ & Business, As, Norway; [Wasenden, Ole Christian] Telenor Res, Oslo, Norway; [Alfnes, Frode] Oslo Metropolitan Univ, Consumpt Res Norway, Oslo, Norway",Norwegian University of Life Sciences; Oslo Metropolitan University (OsloMet),"Wasenden, OC (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Sch Econ & Business, As, Norway.",olwa@nmbu.no,"Alfnes, Frode/I-8970-2016","Alfnes, Frode/0000-0002-3072-9308",Research Council of Norway,Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway),<SUP>1</SUP> This research was supported by a grant from the Research Council of Norway.,,38,0,0,4,4,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5961,1879-3258,,TELECOMMUN POLICY,Telecommun.

We use a two-stage least squares approach to address endogeneity and control for socioeconomic, demographic, and pandemic-related factors. Results show broadband availability and wired broadband adoption both had significant, positive impacts on the employment rate.

The change has been spurred by disruptive ef-ficiencies in digital platforms. First, information distribution has been altered by near-costless electronic reproduction. Second, traditional bundles - packaging editorial content of publica-tions or broadcast networks with general-interest advertising messages - have been eclipsed by competitively superior news aggregation hubs. Third, specialized content, including advertising, has become more easily targeted and better supplied via long tails. Fourth, the democratization of publishing has transformed editing into platform mediation. The resulting changes in market organization have made vastly higher volumes of news and public affairs information - from exponentially more sources - easily available to mass market consumers. In so doing, they have rendered the Walter Cronkite consensus obsolete, creating social controversy and considerable backlash. Demands to regulate, or re-regulate, are frequently voiced across the political spectrum. Such policies as public interest licensing, public utility regulation, and the Fairness Doctrine are here evaluated.","[Hazlett, Thomas W.] Clemson Univ, Econ, Clemson, SC 29634 USA",Clemson University,"Hazlett, TW (corresponding author), Clemson Univ, Econ, Clemson, SC 29634 USA.",hazlett@clemson.edu,,,,,,,100,0,0,3,3,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5961,1879-3258,,TELECOMMUN POLICY,Telecommun.

These changes will be much more pervasive than any previous introduction of new mobile 'generations' and they are expected to influence the whole economy. For this reason, the global rush for 5G technology is not only considered crucial in economic or technological terms, but also for its implications in terms of geopolitics, international policy and national security. This paper presents an analysis of the patents in the most relevant fields of specialization connected to the 5G development. The period under investigation is from 2010 to 2019, and the data are extracted from the European Patent Office (EPO) and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) database. The analysis shows how the technologies and the specialisations needed to develop 5G are in the hands of a few countries around the globe, and how single European countries, taken in isolation, are not among those leading players. However, Europe, considered as a whole, competes well with the US and Asia in terms of patented innovations, suggesting the economic and strategic relevance of strengthening cooperation within the EU.","[Parcu, Pier Luigi; Innocenti, Niccolo; Carrozza, Chiara] European Univ Inst, Robert Schuman Ctr Adv Studies, Florence Sch Regulat, Via Boccaccio 121, I-50133 Florence, Italy",European University Institute,"Innocenti, N (corresponding author), European Univ Inst, Robert Schuman Ctr Adv Studies, Florence Sch Regulat, Via Boccaccio 121, I-50133 Florence, Italy.",niccolo.innocenti@eui.eu,,"Innocenti, Niccolo/0000-0001-8421-5479; PARCU, Pier Luigi/0000-0003-2156-7308",Qualcomm Inc,Qualcomm Inc,"We are indebted to the three anonymous referees and the Editor in Chief, Professor Erik Bohlin, for their valuable suggestions.

The proposed method relies on a partial equilibrium simulation approach and estimates the welfare impacts on current consumers and the potential welfare effects among new consumers brought into the market by changes in prices due to competition. This approach is applied to the information and communication technology (ICT) sector in Ethiopia, one of the three countries in the world with a monopoly in the market for mobile phone services. Based on household budget survey data for 2015/16 and departing from a baseline reform scenario that dilutes the market share of the state-owned monopoly to 45 percent, the simulation model estimates a 25.3 percent reduction in the price of mobile services and an increase in 5.7 million new users of mobile services. The predicted drop in prices and increased users would generate a combined relative welfare gain of 1.18 percent (1.09 percent among current users and 0.09 percent among new users), that could be translated into a 0.31 percentage point decline in the national poverty rate and equivalent to lifting about 275,000 people out of poverty. Alternative reform scenarios that dilute the market share of the monopoly to 75 percent and to 30 percent are expected to reduce poverty rate in 0.13 and 0.52 percentage points, respectively. The method proposed in this study represents a useful tool for promoting competition reforms in developing countries, particularly in sectors known for excluding significant segments of the population because of high consumer prices.","[Rodriguez-Castelan, Carlos; Malasquez, Eduardo A.; Ochoa, Rogelio Granguillhome] World Bank, Poverty & Equ Global Practice, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Araar, Abdelkrim] Univ Laval, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Araar, Abdelkrim] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Araar, Abdelkrim] Partnership Econ Policy, Nairobi, Kenya",The World Bank; Laval University; The World Bank,"Malasquez, EA (corresponding author), World Bank, Poverty & Equ Global Practice, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",crodriguezc@worldbank.org; araar.abdelkrim@ecn.ulaval.ca; emalasquez@worldbank.org; rgranguillhomeoc@worldbank.org,,"Malasquez, Eduardo A./0000-0001-9726-5272",,,,,56,0,0,0,1,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5961,1879-3258,,TELECOMMUN POLICY,Telecommun.

We decompose SMEs' access to finance into two components, i.e., basic and advanced access to finance. Basic access to finance is captured from two indicators; namely, the firm's bank account and line of credit from a financial institution, while advanced access is captured by whether the firm's investments and working capital is financed by the bank. Consistent with the information asymmetry hypothesis, our findings confirm that ICT adoption reduces information asymmetry between SMEs and banks. Therefore, banks are more likely to grant credit and to finance projects and the working capital needs of innovative SMEs. Moreover, this study complements the argument of resource-based theory (RBT) and suggests that innovation can provide a competitive advantage with regard to a firm's access to credit. These results imply that SMEs with greater access to and use of new technologies are more likely to acquire financial resources from banks. The results hold to various robustness checks and identification strategies. Our findings provide important policy implications for SMEs around the globe.","[Mushtaq, Rizwan] EDC Paris Business Sch, OCRE Lab, Paris, France; [Gull, Ammar Ali] Ecole Super Sci Commerciales Angers ESSCA, Lyon, France; [Usman, Muhammad] Nanjing Audit Univ, Sch Accounting, Nanjing, Peoples R China",Nanjing Audit University,"Usman, M (corresponding author), Nanjing Audit Univ, Sch Accounting, Nanjing, Peoples R China.",rizwan.mushtaq@univ-lyon3.fr; ammarshaukit@gmail.com; 320335@nau.edu.cn,"Mushtaq, Rizwan/M-7814-2013",,,,,,59,3,3,3,3,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5961,1879-3258,,TELECOMMUN POLICY,Telecommun.

In parallel, the over-the-top platform Netflix gained popularity and Brazil has become one of its biggest markets. The objective of this paper is to investigate the competitive effects of Netflix's entry on the incumbent cable TV industry. We explore the regional variability of Netflix's popularity (measured by Google Trends) and combined this information with official data of the cable TV market. Using a two-way fixed effects estimator with state-month observations (covering the period of 2012-2019), we showed that the increase in one standard deviation in Netflix popularity is associated with a 3.62% reduction in the density of cable TV subscribers and with a 19.69% reduction in the number of small firms that operate cable TV.","[Soares da Silva, Joao Marcos; de Andrade Lima, Ricardo Carvalho] Univ Catolica Brasilia, Dept Econ, Brasilia, DF, Brazil",Universidade Catolica de Brasilia,"Lima, RCD (corresponding author), Univ Catolica Brasilia, Dept Econ, Brasilia, DF, Brazil.",ricardo.clima@p.ucb.br,,"Lima, Ricardo/0000-0003-3239-2371",Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior - Brasil (CAPES) [001],Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior - Brasil (CAPES)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)),This study was financed in part by the Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior - Brasil (CAPES) - Finance Code 001.,,22,0,0,6,6,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5961,1879-3258,,TELECOMMUN POLICY,Telecommun.

One of these challenges is the growing quantity of food demand, which is highly vital for regional trade, food security, and meeting the nutritious requirements of the population. A timely prediction with accuracy about crop yield could be valuable for greater food production and maintainability of sustainable agricultural growth. This paper presents a predictive model of wheat production using machine learning. The northern areas of Pakistan which grow wheat are selected as a case study due to their importance in the country's agricultural sector. We collected data of five years and selected the best attribute subset related to crop production. We applied twelve (12) algorithms by dividing data samples into three sets. Experimental results helped to shortlist three algorithms for the final analysis i.e. Sequential Minimal Optimization Regression (SMOreg), Multilayer Processing (MLP) and Gaussian Process (GP). The Root Mean Square (RMSE) and Percentage Absolute Difference (PAD) metrics were used to validate the results. The SMOreg obtained the lowest PAD (0.0093) and RMSE (0.5552) values. MLP was a little closer with second-lowest PAD (0.0116) and RMSE (0.737) value. The performance of GP was found lowest due to higher PAD (0.2203) and RMSE (17.7423) values. Our findings confirm the predictive ability of machine learning algorithms on a crop dataset recorded in a localized environment, which could be replicated on other crops and regions.","[Ahmed, Moiz Uddin; Hussain, Iqbal] Allama Iqbal Open Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Islamabad 44000, Pakistan",,"Ahmed, MU (corresponding author), Allama Iqbal Open Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Islamabad 44000, Pakistan.",moiz.ahmed@aiou.edu.pk,,,,,,,86,0,0,2,2,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5961,1879-3258,,TELECOMMUN POLICY,Telecommun.

This gap means we lack information about the trajectory of broadband deployment in tribal areas. It also means we lack comparative information about the similarities or differences in the trajectory of broadband deployment in tribal areas compared to non-tribal areas (e.g. urban and rural areas). To address this gap in our knowledge, this study utilizes longitudinal tract data constructed from information in the FCC Form 477 database to analyze broadband provision in tribal areas from 2014 to 2020. Empirical results show that rural tribes may be falling further behind the rest of the nation in broadband provision, while metropolitan tribal areas now enjoy better provision levels, on average, than their non-tribal counterparts. Additionally, the nuances of broadband distributions across tribal, rural, and urban areas make clear that a one-size-fits-all policy to aid tribal communities is inappropriate to address these and other related challenges. This is especially true as concerns about the intersection of federal broadband policy with tribal sovereignty and self-determination emerge.","[Mack, Elizabeth A.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Geog Environm & Spatial Sci, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Helderop, Edward; Grubesic, Tony H.] Univ Texas Austin, Sch Informat, Austin, TX 78701 USA; [Keene, Thomas; Loveridge, Scott; Mann, John] Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Kowalkowski, Brian; Gollnow, Miranda] Coll Menominee Nat, N172 Hwy 47-55, Keshena, WI 54135 USA",Michigan State University; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; Michigan State University,"Mack, EA (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Geog Environm & Spatial Sci, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",emack@msu.edu; edward.helderop@gmail.com; keenetho@msu.edu; loverid2@msu.edu; mannjoh3@msu.edu; grubesic@austin.utexas.edu; bkowalkowski@menominee.edu; mgollnow@menominee.edu,,"Loveridge, Scott/0000-0002-8067-4819; Keene, Thomas/0000-0003-3570-3964; Mann, John/0000-0002-0665-350X","United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Institute of Food and Agriculture, AFRI competitive grant [2020-67023-30958]","United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Institute of Food and Agriculture, AFRI competitive grant","\This research was funded by a grant from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Institute of Food and Agriculture, AFRI competitive grant 2020-67023-30958.",,67,0,0,2,2,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5961,1879-3258,,TELECOMMUN POLICY,Telecommun.

It models the factors associated with switching outcomes, including the direction of change in expenditure and whether those who are observed to switch plans tend to arrive at more or less optimal plans given their usage. A dataset is employed that combines survey responses from mobile consumers with the same consumers' actual usage data in the period 2017-2019; this was collected by Ireland's national regulatory authority. The cost each consumer would have incurred on every plan offered in the market based on their observed usage is estimated. Using models that allow for selection into switching, associations between switching outcomes and demographic and user characteristics are modelled. Controls are included for plan and user attributes, including demographics and proxies for user sophistication and access to alternative communication options. A substantial proportion of intra-operator switchers in the sample increase expenditures when they switch plan. While many switchers move to plans that are more optimal given their usage, a slight majority move to plans that charge a higher price premium over the best available plan (based on observables) than the consumer's previous plan did. Few observable characteristics of consumers or plans seem to be significantly associated with which switches achieve greater optimality, although fixed operator effects are large and significant. These findings add to the weight of evidence which finds that many consumers fail to arrive at the best price even after switching.","[Griffin, Mide; Lyons, Sean; Mohan, Gretta; Mac Domhnaill, Ciaran] Econ & Social Res Inst, Whitaker Sq, Dublin D02 K138 2, Ireland; [Lyons, Sean; Mohan, Gretta] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Econ, Dublin, Ireland; [Joseph, Merin; Evans, John] Commiss Commun Regulat, ComReg, Dublin, Ireland; [Mac Domhnaill, Ciaran] Univ St Andrews, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland",Economic & Social Research Institute (ESRI); Trinity College Dublin; University of St Andrews,"Lyons, S (corresponding author), Econ & Social Res Inst, Whitaker Sq, Dublin D02 K138 2, Ireland.",mide.griffin@esri.ie; sean.lyons@esri.ie; gretta.mohan@esri.ie; merin.joseph@comreg.ie; ciaran.mac-domhnaill@ucdconnect.ie; john.evans@comreg.ie,,"Mac Domhnaill, Ciaran/0000-0002-9869-7103; Lyons, Sean/0000-0002-3526-6947","ESRI, Ireland; Department of the Environment, Australia Electronic Communications Research Programme - Commission for Communications Regulation; Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications in Ireland","ESRI, Ireland; Department of the Environment, Australia Electronic Communications Research Programme - Commission for Communications Regulation; Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications in Ireland","Funding was provided by the ESRI, Ireland; Department of the Environment, Australia Electronic Communications Research Programme, which jointly funded by the Commission for Communications Regulation and the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications in Ireland.",,61,0,0,0,0,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5961,1879-3258,,TELECOMMUN POLICY,Telecommun.

To this end, we propose an integrated input-output (IO) analytical framework to detangle the intertwined relations between ICT and non-ICT sectors, and further incorporate structural path analysis (SPA) and structural decomposition analysis (SDA) to examine the extent to which and how ICT sub-sectors drive the formations and changes of embodied routine/non-routine jobs in ICT. An empirical study using China's national IO tables from World Input-Output Database and the matched occupational employment data derived from 2000 and 2010 Population Census is conducted. We find that China's ICT growth over 2000-2010 has not led to a decline in jobs, which still holds true for both ICT manufacturing and ICT service, as well as for routine/non-routine jobs. We also find an increase in the embodied employment share of non-routine relative to routine jobs. The typical paths source sector-* (intermediate sector)-* ICT final demand generate many routine/non-routine jobs, which are primarily lied in the zero and first rounds. The decomposition results show that the declining sectoral routine/nonroutine job coefficients drives the decline of both ICT embodied routine and non-routine jobs (especially the former), which is completely offset by the rising final demand of ICT. The proposed integrated IO analytical framework could also be applied to other indicators and extended to multi-country/region analysis.","[Niu, Meng; Wang, Zhenguo; Zhang, Yabin] Hunan Univ, Sch Econ & Trade, 109 Shi Jia Chong Rd, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China",Hunan University,"Wang, ZG (corresponding author), Hunan Univ, Sch Econ & Trade, 109 Shi Jia Chong Rd, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China.",wzghenu2013@126.com,,"Wang, Zhenguo/0000-0003-0515-6373",Major Program of National Fund of Philosophy and Social Science of China [18ZDA068]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71803042],Major Program of National Fund of Philosophy and Social Science of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),Funding This work was supported by the Major Program of National Fund of Philosophy and Social Science of China [grant number 18ZDA068] ; and the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 71803042] .,,50,1,1,5,6,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5961,1879-3258,,TELECOMMUN POLICY,Telecommun.

This study treats the pilot policy of the Broadband China strategy as a quasi-natural experiment and investigates the ways in which broadband infrastructure development affects export trade in Chinese cities. Empirical results show that export trade in the pilot cities increases by 6.82%-18.8% on average as a result of the Broadband China policy intervention. Our study shows that this policy can effectively promote the use of Internet facilities, and broadband infrastructure can significantly promote the growth of a city's export trade. Broadband infrastructure influences export trade through the direct channel of improving information efficiency, which in turn lowers logistics costs, promotes trade efficiency, and reduces barriers to trade. There is no significant regional heterogeneity and urban characteristics heterogeneity in the export trade effect. Although broadband infrastructure can affect exports through the indirect channels of industrial structure and technological innovation, the direct effect accounts for much of the total effect.","[Zhou, Fengxiu] Jiangxi Normal Univ, Sch Business, Nanchang 330022, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Wen, Huwei; Lee, Chien-Chiang] Nanchang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Nanchang 330031, Jiangxi, Peoples R China",Jiangxi Normal University; Nanchang University,"Lee, CC (corresponding author), Nanchang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Nanchang 330031, Jiangxi, Peoples R China.",cclee6101@gmail.com,,"Wen, Huwei/0000-0002-8422-1593; Lee, Chien-Chiang/0000-0003-0037-4347; Fengxiu, Zhou/0000-0002-7790-8856",Ministry of Education of Humanities and Social Sciences Project of China [19YJC790202]; National Statistical Science Research Project of China [2021LZ38]; Social Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province of China [21JL02],Ministry of Education of Humanities and Social Sciences Project of China; National Statistical Science Research Project of China; Social Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province of China,=Project supported by the Ministry of Education of Humanities and Social Sciences Project of China (Grant No. 19YJC790202) and the National Statistical Science Research Project of China (Grant No. 2021LZ38).

By conceptualizing and mapping international regime complexity, the actors in international issues concerning GIG are identified and studied and the dynamic interactions between states related to GIG are explored. In particular, the 2012 amendments to the International Telecommunication Regulations are used in our analysis of the factors that have contributed to the creation of disputes and cooperation among states in the GIG regime. The empirical study shows that the influence of powerful states, such as the US and China, can affect other states' decisions on GIG. Furthermore, the findings reveal that democratic states with fewer regulations on business are more likely to support the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers over the International Telecommunication Union.","[Jho, Whasun] Yonsei Univ, Seoul, South Korea; [Kim, Youngwan] Sogang Univ, Seoul, South Korea",Yonsei University; Sogang University,"Kim, Y (corresponding author), Sogang Univ, Seoul, South Korea.",youngwan@sogang.ac.kr,,"Kim, Youngwan/0000-0002-4909-8622; Jho, Whasun/0000-0003-1459-2273",Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea [NRF-2020S1A5C2A03093177]; National Research Foundation of Korea,"Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea)",Acknowledgments This work was supported by the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea and the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF-2020S1A5C2A03093177) .,,81,1,1,5,5,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5961,1879-3258,,TELECOMMUN POLICY,Telecommun.

We find that the share of households with Internet access is 21 percentage points lower in tribal areas than in neighboring non-tribal areas. When compared to these non-tribal areas, download speeds, whether measured using fixed or mobile broadband networks, are approximately 75% slower in tribal areas, while the lowest price for basic Internet services in tribal areas is 11% higher. Regression techniques reveal that traditional cost factors such as terrain and population density fully explain the price gap but account for only a fraction of the tribal differences in Internet access and connection speeds. Income differences are strong predictors of Internet access but do not affect connection speeds. A sizable amount of the variation in the access and home connection gap between tribal and non-tribal is left unexplained. We conclude with a discussion of how federal broadband programs have penetrated Indian Country, how tribal-specific factors are related to the variation in Internet access within Indian Country, and the potential policy implications of our findings.","[Bauer, Anahid] Univ Illinois, Dept Econ, Champaign, IL USA; [Feir, Donn.

Data were collected from sixteen auctions for the C-band that took place in the Member States of the European Union (EU) and in the United Kingdom (UK) between 2017 and 2020 for the introduction of the fifth generation (5G) of mobile communication technology. The selected instruments of intervention are: spectrum packaging, spectrum caps, set-asides, geographical scope of the license, license duration, various forms of license obligations, reserve prices and auction format.Significant differences were observed in national approaches to spectrum packaging, license obligations and reserve prices for efficiency purposes. Our analysis also shows that European national regulators are paying increasing attention to concerns over fairness of decisions on spectrum, or equity, especially by creating opportunities for local private networks to access the spectrum and by imposing requirements on network operators to guarantee more uniform population coverage of newly created 5G networks.","[Kus, Agnieszka] Pope John Paul II State Sch Higher Educ Biala Podl, Fac Econ Sci, Biala Podlaska, Poland; [Massaro, Maria] Korea Univ Seoul, Res Inst Informat & Culture, Ctr ICT & Soc CIS, Sch Media & Commun, Seoul, South Korea",Korea University,"Kus, A (corresponding author), Pope John Paul II State Sch Higher Educ Biala Podl, Fac Econ Sci, Biala Podlaska, Poland.",a.kus@dydaktyka.pswbp.pl; mariamassaro.m@gmail.com,,"Kus, Agnieszka/0000-0002-6258-6823",Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea; National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2019S1A3A2099973]; MSIT (Ministry of Science and ICT) of Korea [IITP-2020-0-01749],"Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea); MSIT (Ministry of Science and ICT) of Korea(Ministry of Science & ICT (MSIT), Republic of Korea)","Maria Massaro's research was supported by the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea, the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF-2019S1A3A2099973), and the MSIT (Ministry of Science and ICT) of Korea, under the ITRC (Information Technology Research Center) support program (IITP-2020-0-01749) supervised by the IITP (Institute of Information & Communications Technology Planning & Evaluation).",,73,0,0,0,0,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5961,1879-3258,,TELECOMMUN POLICY,Telecommun.

By reshaping competition among market players and among technologies, it changes the trade-offs underlying the application of the non-discrimination principle. In this paper, we provide a unified view of the implications of these technological developments for four instantiations of this principle that span the entire digital value chain: non-discrimination in FRAND licensing of standard-essential patents (SEPs), vertical separation remedies, network neutrality and technological neutrality. We conclude that overly rigid and non-technology neutral interpretations of the non-discrimination requirement would be at odds with technological evolution and would be incompatible with the objective to maximize the overall value of digital networks.","[Rossi, Maria Alessandra] G DAnnunzio Univ Chieti Pescara, Dept Econ, Econ Policy, Viale Pindaro 42, I-65127 Pescara, Italy",G d'Annunzio University of Chieti-Pescara,"Rossi, MA (corresponding author), G DAnnunzio Univ Chieti Pescara, Dept Econ, Econ Policy, Viale Pindaro 42, I-65127 Pescara, Italy.",alessandra.rossi@unich.it,,,,,,,44,1,1,5,5,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5961,1879-3258,,TELECOMMUN POLICY,Telecommun.

The Heckman selection model was estimated based on data taken from the Encuesta Nacional sobre Disponibilidad y Uso de Tecnologias de la Informaci ' on en los Hogares (ENDUTIH or National Survey on the Availability and Use of Information Technologies in the Household) 2018. The results obtained show that the probability of having children internet accessing and usage patterns (homework, courses, and blogs) depends on level of schooling, economic status, digital skills, and place of residence, as well as the presence of electronic devices and infomediaries in the household.

Whereas the European Commission acknowledges the contributions of platform companies to innovation, it also sees actual and potential damages occurring from their powerful position.

The main research question is how the European Commission has been evaluating the competitive effects of platforms under merger control and whether its approach is adequate to address the manifold concerns related to platforms and competition. Based on a case study analysis, we conclude that the European Commission (1) recognises the platform circumstance, their essential intermediary role in the digital industry and the importance of maintaining fair competition; (2) its analysis has been slowly evolving becoming more granular; (3) platforms' behaviour and not their size per se is most often the central concern; (4) the proposed Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act packages tackle platform concerns identified in the European Commission's ex-ante analysis, signalling that its analysis seems to have inspired their creation.","[Afilipoaie, Adelaida; Donders, Karen; Ballon, Pieter] Vrije Univ Brussel, SMIT, IMEC, Pl Laan 9,2nd Floor, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Donders, Karen] VRT, Brussels, Belgium",IMEC; Vrije Universiteit Brussel,"Afilipoaie, A (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Brussel, SMIT, IMEC, Pl Laan 9,2nd Floor, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.",adelaida.afilipoaie@vub.be,,"Afilipoaie, Adelaida/0000-0002-8866-8536; Ballon, Pieter/0000-0001-6066-3242",,,,,87,0,0,1,1,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5961,1879-3258,,TELECOMMUN POLICY,Telecommun.

The trade effect of SEPs on China is different from that on matured economies because of the initially low value of its SEPs.","[von Laer, Maximilian; Blind, Knut; Ramel, Florian] Tech Univ Berlin, Chair Innovat Econ, Str 17 Juni 135, D-10623 Berlin, Germany; [Blind, Knut] Fraunhofer Inst Syst & Innovat Res, Breslauer Str 48, D-76139 Karlsruhe, Germany",Technical University of Berlin; Fraunhofer Gesellschaft,"Blind, K (corresponding author), Tech Univ Berlin, Chair Innovat Econ, Str 17 Juni 135, D-10623 Berlin, Germany.",knut.blind@tu-berlin.de,,,DFG Graduate School Reflexive Innovation Society,DFG Graduate School Reflexive Innovation Society(Fondazione Telethon),Max von Laer received funding from the DFG Graduate School Reflexive Innovation Society.,,85,2,2,32,35,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5961,1879-3258,,TELECOMMUN POLICY,Telecommun.

This represents a significant shift from prior datasets, where broadband availability was gauged from the estimated number of people/households in each Census Block (i.e., without geolocations). The inclusion of agricultural structures is particularly important, since broadband investment in agricultural zones has been limited to date. We use an early version of the BSLF for the state of Oklahoma, produced by CostQuest Associates, to demonstrate the opportunities and issues that may arise for broadband researchers and policymakers as the DATA Act becomes reality. We highlight four main takeaways: (1) consideration of non-residential units greatly impacts overall availability estimates; (2) data quality (and quantity) varies greatly across counties; (3) BSLF residential unit counts differ from FCC or Census estimates; and (4) practi-tioners will still need service-area shapefiles/addresses from providers to use the fabric most effectively.","[Whitacre, Brian; Biedny, Christina] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA",Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater,"Whitacre, B (corresponding author), Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA.",brian.whitacre@okstate.edu,,"Biedny, Christina/0000-0002-9400-3741; Whitacre, Brian/0000-0002-5083-1828",,,,,56,1,1,0,0,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5961,1879-3258,,TELECOMMUN POLICY,Telecommun.

The Federal Communications Commission has detailed data on broadband subscriptions from its semi-annual Form 477 collection. The USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) releases a complete census of agriculture every five years to measure agricultural activity. By pairing periodic releases of the Form 477 data collection with information on farm production expenses and crop yields from corresponding releases of the Census of Agriculture, the analysis directly evaluates the benefit of rural broadband development on the U.S. farming industry. Overall, I find evidence of crop yield improvements from increased Internet penetration rates at thresholds of 25 Megabits-per-second download and 3 Megabits-per-second upload speeds. Among the findings, doubling the number of 25+/3+ connections per 1000 households is associated with a 3.79% increase in corn yields, as measured in bushels per acre. I also find some evidence of cost savings at thresholds of 10 Megabits-per-second download and 0.768 Megabitsper-second upload speeds. Doubling the number of 10+/0.768+ connections per 1000 households is associated with a 2.41% decrease in operating expenses per farm operation. The paper also provides an introductory look at changes in the composition and speed thresholds of connectivity available for selected field crops over time.","[LoPiccalo, Katherine] Consumer Financial Protect Bur, Washington, DC 20038 USA",,"LoPiccalo, K (corresponding author), Consumer Financial Protect Bur, Washington, DC 20038 USA.",Katherine.Lopiccalo@cfpb.gov,,,,,,,49,0,0,2,2,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5961,1879-3258,,TELECOMMUN POLICY,Telecommun.

Typically, mobile phones are designed with a view towards obsolescence for users in industrially developed countries, as the expected repair in these circumstances is minimal. In contrast, in developing countries, such as India, these phones are constantly repaired and are owned several times by different people before their final demise. Therefore, to support repairability, a field study based in Mumbai, India, was conducted to understand the cognitive basis of repair. The results were further analyzed using a cognitive work analysis framework that provides insight into the possibilities for informational requirements for design. The findings indicate that small-scale repair shops (3-4 repairmen) and the hole-in-the wall shops (1 repairman) can benefit from the intervention in terms of informational support for the repair activity. If the cognitive dimension of repair is supported for these low-cost repair shops, we can expect an increase in the capability and efficacy of the repairmen, resulting in fewer phones ending up as e-waste. Thus, due to its low cost, informational diagrams that support the repair activity can be incorporated by the manufacturer without any radical changes in existing proprietary technology, resulting in the possibility for the long-term growth of the repair ecology in a country such as India.","[Kant, Vivek; Tapia, Ridhima; Mondal, Saikat] Indian Inst Technol, IDC Sch Design, Human Factors & Sociotech Syst Studios, Mumbai 400076, Maharashtra, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Bombay,"Kant, V (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol, IDC Sch Design, Human Factors & Sociotech Syst Studios, Mumbai 400076, Maharashtra, India.",vivek.kant@iitb.ac.in,,,Indian Institute of Technology Bombay [Spons/ID/10001742-2/2018],Indian Institute of Technology Bombay,"The authors would like to thank all the participants for taking the time to show us the inner-world of mobile repair in Mumbai, India.

People previously excluded from the financial system have started to have access to financial services such as receiving and sending remittances, saving, and borrowing. This study examines the effect of network accessibility on the use of mobile money in six developing countries (Bangladesh, Kenya, Nigeria, Pakistan, Tanzania, and Uganda) using GPS information on each household and mobile phone network coverage maps. We find that among these six countries, network accessibility is associated with the use of mobile money in a robust way only in Pakistan and Tanzania. In those two countries, when a household location becomes 10 km closer to the center of the area with multiple mobile networks, the probability of using mobile money increases by 10 percent. In the other countries, we did not find a robust relationship between the use of mobile money and network accessibility. This suggests that increasing network accessibility may not be an efficient method for increasing mobile money adoption in certain countries. The fact that mobile money use rates differ between Tanzania and Pakistan also suggests that the effect of mobile networks is unrelated to the overall level of mobile money adoption.","[Naito, Hisahiro] Univ Tsukuba, Grad Sch Humanities & Social Sci, Tennodai 1-1-1, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Yamamoto, Shinnosuke] Univ Tsukuba, Coll Int Studies, Tennodai 1-1-1, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan",University of Tsukuba; University of Tsukuba,"Naito, H (corresponding author), Univ Tsukuba, Grad Sch Humanities & Social Sci, Tennodai 1-1-1, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.",naito@dpipe.tsukuba.ac.jp; shinno6132@gmail.com,,,faculty research fund of the University of Tsukuba,faculty research fund of the University of Tsukuba,H.N. appreciates financial support from the faculty research fund of the University of Tsukuba.,,41,1,1,3,3,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5961,1879-3258,,TELECOMMUN POLICY,Telecommun.

We construct a composite sector using a hypothetical extraction methodology based on the most recent Greek input-output table and structural business statistics at the national level. Our framework builds on the formal definition of the ICT sector provided by OECD and includes two distinct sub-components, ICT manufacturing and ICT services. In the second stage of this study, we explore the production linkages among ICT services, ICT manufacturing and the rest of the Greek industries using input-output-based and network analysis-based metrics that build on the intermediate transactions of an expanded input-output table of the Greek economy that includes the two sectors. Our empirical findings suggest that the total ICT sector has a major contribution to the Greek economy in terms of GDP and employment, but this is driven mainly by the ICT services component. We further identify that ICT services are more integrated in the Greek production network compared to ICT manufacturing, but their production linkages are underperforming in terms of meaningful contribution to the activity of the rest of the sectors. These results reflect the low integration of digital technologies and can be further embedded in a discussion on the ICT deficiencies of the Greek economy and the need for targeted regulatory and financial interventions.","[Stamopoulos, Dimitrios; Dimas, Petros; Tsakanikas, Aggelos] Natl Tech Univ Athens, Lab Ind & Energy Econ LIEE, 9 Heroon Polytech Str,Zografou Campus, Athens, Greece",National Technical University of Athens,"Stamopoulos, D (corresponding author), Natl Tech Univ Athens, Lab Ind & Energy Econ LIEE, 9 Heroon Polytech Str,Zografou Campus, Athens, Greece.",dstamopoulos@mail.ntua.gr; petrdimas@chemeng.ntua.gr; atsaka@central.ntua.gr,"Dimas, Petros/GYV-3330-2022","Dimas, Petros/0000-0001-5408-229X; Tsakanikas, Aggelos/0000-0002-9734-3354",,,,,53,7,7,9,9,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5961,1879-3258,,TELECOMMUN POLICY,Telecommun.

While technological utopians believed that One Laptop Per Child (OLPC)-like programs could reduce societal in-equalities, the economics literature evaluating these initiatives has mostly focused on student's human capital. Results suggest no impact, even for successful programs such as Uruguay's own OLPC-inspired Plan Ceibal. In this paper, we use an event-study approach to difference-indifferences to identify the impact of Plan Ceibal on the household adoption of technological goods across income quintiles. Our results show that Plan Ceibal helped to bridge domestic digital disparities in terms of access to PC and favored the uptake of internet services. We discuss the potential mechanisms behind these results. Regarding household PC access, even though Plan Ceibal was conceived as a universal program targeting primary-level students attending public schools, both infantilization of poverty and a dual-system educational stratification may explain why this initiative had a heterogenous impact across different income groups. Regarding household connectivity, Plan Ceibal reduced the cost of the bundle required to consume internet services at the time of the study, improving affordability and access among households with beneficiaries of the program.","[Diaz, Carlos; Dodel, Matias] Univ Catol Uruguay, Dept Social Sci, Montevideo, Uruguay; [Menese, Pablo] Univ Republica, Ctr Estudios Polit Educ, Montevideo, Uruguay","Universidad de la Republica, Uruguay","Dodel, M (corresponding author), Univ Catol Uruguay, Dept Social Sci, Montevideo, Uruguay.",matias.dodel@ucu.edu.uy,,"Diaz, Carlos/0000-0002-8823-5976",,,,,48,0,0,6,6,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5961,1879-3258,,TELECOMMUN POLICY,Telecommun.

They offer one-stop-shop licensing efficiencies, reduce transaction costs, and increase the predictability of the licensing environment for the benefit of innovation diffusion. However, pools failed to take off for previous cellular standards. This article analyses both retrospectively the reasons for such failures and prospectively what makes the 5G environment more conductive to pool formation and licensing. Avanci, a patent pool for licensing cellular standards in the Internet of Things (IoT), is a significant development but has limited licensing coverage so far. The article then recommends five policy principles to facilitate pool licensing in the IoT. They include recognising that only enough upstream SEP owners need to join the 5G pool to create a market signalling effect. Some vertically integrated SEP owners may remain outsiders, and some bilateral licensing may co-exist without damaging the pool's success. To encourage upstream SEP owners to join the pool, they should be allowed to set 'high enough' royalty rates and divide pools' royalties among members under value proportionality rules. 5G pools must also be flexible and adopt different licensing programs that consider the specificities of each IoT market. Finally, pool administrators should consult with IoT implementers before establishing licensing programs for them and have infringement legal standing if everything else fails. These principles would go a long way in spurring the broader use of 5G pool licensing for a more efficient, straightforward, and predictable IoT licensing environment.","[Nikolic, Igor] European Univ Inst, Florence, Italy; [Galli, Niccolo] Res Associate European Univ Inst, Florence, Italy",European University Institute,"Galli, N (corresponding author), Res Associate European Univ Inst, Florence, Italy.",niccolo.galli@eui.eu,,"Nikolic, Igor/0000-0002-5149-2258",,,,,82,1,1,12,12,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5961,1879-3258,,TELECOMMUN POLICY,Telecommun.

At the same time, governments around the world have enacted data policies that restrict such cross border data flows in their effort to claim sovereignty over data generated from within their countries. However, scholars have long proclaimed that any restrictions to the Internet and associated digital trade will have serious economic consequences. Given this context, we analyze the impact of data policies that impose restrictions on digital trade, specifically on cross border data flows. We construct Market Data Restrictions Index (MDRI), that measures the data restrictions faced by an exporting country from their trade partners. We use a variation of random effect model on a panel data set consisting of 60 countries that contribute to more than 50 percent of IT services export during the period 2006-2017. The results indicate that apart from variables such as Foreign Direct Investment, and Service Value Added, the MDRI of partner countries has a moderate negative effect on IT services export. If countries move from liberal policies to stringent data restrictions, the economies of the country that exports its ICT services to these partner countries is affected substantially. Hence government regulators shall be cautious in imposing stringent data restrictions as it affects global digital trade.","[Gupta, Shagufta] Consumer Unity & Trust Soc Int, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Ghosh, Poulomi] Indian Polit Act Comm, Kolkata, India; [Sridhar, V.] Int Inst Informat Technol Bangalore, Ctr IT & Publ Policy, 26-C Elect Cty,Hosur Rd, Bengaluru 560 035, India",,"Sridhar, V (corresponding author), Int Inst Informat Technol Bangalore, Ctr IT & Publ Policy, 26-C Elect Cty,Hosur Rd, Bengaluru 560 035, India.",shagufta.gupta@gmail.com; poulomi03.ghosh@gmail.com; vsridhar@iiitb.ac.in,,"Sridhar, Varadharajan/0000-0002-1038-9908",,,,,93,0,0,12,12,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5961,1879-3258,,TELECOMMUN POLICY,Telecommun.

The analysis is grounded in a conceptual framework that explicitly considers the complementarities among networks, applications, and services. Good policy arrangements align the legal and regulatory framework with the technical and economic characteristics of the sector and the broader, social visions for new technologies. Because the future development of 5G technology and markets is open-ended, policy has to be developed with incomplete knowledge and under conditions of uncertainty. These circumstances call for adaptive forms of policy and a focus on the creation of guardrails for market players, backed up by regulatory powers to intervene more directly if necessary. In the technologically dynamic 5G system, multiple stable policy constellations are feasible, but they likely will result in divergent outcomes and performance characteristics.

While different technical aspects related to 5G have been extensively examined by researchers worldwide, a lack in the existing literature is the economics of 5G in terms of business cases of specific 5G use cases. In this article we analyse the business case for three 5G use cases in an industrial sea port area, the Hamburg port in Germany, over the period 2020-2030. The first use case is enhanced mobile broadband and the results show a payback period lower than one year for all the scenarios analysed. The second use case is automation of container handling in the port's container terminal. It was found that the payback period is also lower than one year with a positive business case net present value in all scenarios studied. The business case of the third case, augmented reality for construction projects in the port's area, is challenging as the payback period was 5 years for the baseline case. Moreover, when performing the sensitivity analysis, it was found that in several scenarios there was a negative return on investment, and it was not possible to recover the investment over the time period studied. It can be concluded that mobile network operators will need to be careful as not all new 5G service offerings may have a positive business case. Future research work should focus on studying other 5G use cases in the port area, and on examining other industrial areas beyond ports such as airports, science parks and manufacturing facilities.","[Schneir, Juan Rendon; Zimmermann, Gerd] Deutsch Telekom, Landgrabenweg 151, D-53227 Bonn, Germany; [Bradford, Julie; Ajibulu, Ade; Pearson, Ken; Konstantinou, Konstantinos; Osman, Hassan] Real Wireless, POB 2218, Pulborough RH20 4XB, W Sussex, England",Deutsche Telekom AG,"Schneir, JR (corresponding author), Deutsch Telekom, Landgrabenweg 151, D-53227 Bonn, Germany.",juan.rendon-schneir@telekom.de; julie.bradford@real-wireless.com; ade.ajibulu@real-wireless.com; ken.pearson@real-wireless.com; costas.konstantinou@gmail.com; hassan.osman@real-wireless.com; zimmermanng@telekom.de,,,European Commission,European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre),"This work has been performed within the framework of the 5G PPP program partially funded by the European Commission within the Horizon 2020 Framework Program.

A series of panel datasets are assembled to measure the improvement of city's ICT infrastructure and the change of firm performance during the years 2001-2016 in China. The findings demonstrate that city's ICTs positively promoted firm performance, including financial profitability, marketing performance and innovation performance. Instrumental variables are employed to verify the positive impact of city's ICTs infrastructure on firm profitability. Taking advantage of an exogenous variation of telecommunications upgrade as a natural experiment, this study uses the difference-in-difference approach to establish causality between cities' ICT infrastructure and firm profitability.

But the digital economy is experienced locally, and its effects are spatial. Measuring them requires better community-level data on economic activities online. While new government data measures broadband subscriptions down to neighborhoods, existing public data do not measure how broadband is used in local communities, and whether this digital activity affects economic outcomes. We analyze new monthly data on over 20 million domain name hosts/websites in the United States from November 2018 to November 2020 drawing on customer data. Surveys show that 3 out of 4 of these domains are commercial, including microbusinesses as well as websites for both online and brick-and-mortar establishments. How is the density of domain name hosts in a community (the number in a zip code or county divided by the population) related to local economic opportunity, controlling for other known factors? Using statistical matching and time series data, results show the density of domain name hosts positively predicts community economic prosperity, recovery from the 2008 recession, and change in median income. Interactions between the density of these hosts and broadband subscriptions also predict lower monthly unemployment rates over time, including after the March 2020 pandemic. Commercial data can improve our understanding of broadband's impacts, including its potential for inclusive growth in diverse communities.","[Mossberger, Karen] Univ Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [LaCombe, Scott] Smith Coll, Northampton, MA 01063 USA; [Tolbert, Caroline J.] Univ Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA",University of Arizona; Smith College; University of Iowa,"Mossberger, K (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Sch Publ Affairs, 411 N Cent Ave,Suite 450, Phoenix, AZ 85004 USA.",karen.mossberger@asu.edu,,,GoDaddy,GoDaddy,"De-identified data and funding for analysis were provided by GoDaddy.

To perform the analysis, we adopt the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM). The empirical findings are as follows. First, while the calculated net impacts are sub-stantially positive, the corresponding marginal ICT effects utilized for calculating net effects are extremely negative. Second, an extensive study is carried out to determine complementing policy thresholds. These thresholds include: 21.959 (per 100 people) telephone penetration for total income from tax revenue; 16.333 (per 100 people) internet penetration for total income from tax; 21.125 internet penetration (per 100 people) for the income from the tax on non-resource income.

However, current 5G technology reports predominately draw on patent data to identify technology developing organizations, ignoring the importance of publications and standard contributions. Therefore, we identify 5G technology developing organizations in publishing, patenting, and standardization and compile a unique dataset to identify leading organizations per category and to identify possible correlations and interdependencies. We find that for companies offering fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory (FRAND) licensing conditions related to standard-essential patents, their publication, patent, and standard contribution counts highly correlate. Our findings suggest that 5G technology developing companies holding a high number of patents declared to 5G manage the three contributing factors of publishing, patenting, and standardization to optimize their impact on 5G technology development. Furthermore, we show that patenting and standardization are dominated by a few large companies from the United States, China, Korea, Japan, Finland, and Sweden, while publishing is much more globally distributed and not as concentrated. Our research suggests that scientific findings can be more easily published via scientific journals and that barriers might hinder filing patents and participating in standardization committees focusing on 5G, which only large companies overcome.","[Buggenhagen, Magnus] IPlytics GmbH, Transistor Aufgang C, Ohlauer Str 43, D-10999 Berlin, Germany; [Buggenhagen, Magnus; Blind, Knut] Tech Univ Berlin, Chair Innovat Econ, Str 17 Juni 135, D-10623 Berlin, Germany; [Buggenhagen, Magnus] Itf Innovat Transfer & Forschungsinst Schwerin eV, Schwerin, Germany; [Blind, Knut] Fraunhofer Inst Syst & Innovat Res, Breslauer Str 48, D-76139 Karlsruhe, Germany",Technical University of Berlin; Fraunhofer Gesellschaft,"Buggenhagen, M (corresponding author), IPlytics GmbH, Transistor Aufgang C, Ohlauer Str 43, D-10999 Berlin, Germany.",buggenhagen@iplytics.com,,"Blind, Knut/0000-0002-6510-122X",,,,,98,3,3,12,12,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5961,1879-3258,,TELECOMMUN POLICY,Telecommun.

Findings indicate that there is no grey digital divide for wearable ICT; however, such a gap appears for apps. Moreover, the elderly are less willing to get advice from their physicians on these tools regardless their experience with them. Such results suggest the importance of promoting ICT for health, among the elderly, as new improved generations of the standard gadgets to which they are used. Future research should try to study the potential of wearable devices among seniors.","[Rosalia Vicente, Maria] Univ Oviedo, Appl Econ, Campus Cristo S-N, Oviedo 33006, Asturias, Spain",University of Oviedo,"Vicente, MR (corresponding author), Univ Oviedo, Appl Econ, Campus Cristo S-N, Oviedo 33006, Asturias, Spain.",mrosalia@uniovi.es,"vicente, maria rosalia/H-9831-2015","vicente, maria rosalia/0000-0001-7826-8494",,,,,79,2,2,12,12,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5961,1879-3258,,TELECOMMUN POLICY,Telecommun.

Yet the extent to which the rural/ urban digital divide extends to pricing and demand for broadband services is not well understood. Using a dataset of more than 4700 residential survey responses from southern Ontario, Canada, we assess the disparity in pricing and willingness to pay for broadband across rural and urban households. Our results suggest that rural users face higher installation and monthly fees while receiving a significantly inferior quality of service than their urban counterparts. Demand among rural users for improved broadband access is also higher than for urban users. These results may strengthen the business case for expanding broadband services into rural areas and/or supporting justification for public subsidization. Our analysis also suggests higher economic net benefits from prioritizing majority access at current federal service objectives rather than investing in a small number of users to receive higher quality broadband.","[Worden, David] Univ Guelph, Sch Environm Design & Rural Dev, Reg & Rural Broadband R2B2 Project, Guelph, ON, Canada; [Hambly, Helen] Univ Guelph, Sch Environm Design & Rural Dev, Guelph, ON, Canada",University of Guelph; University of Guelph,"Worden, D (corresponding author), Univ Guelph, Sch Environm Design & Rural Dev, Reg & Rural Broadband R2B2 Project, Guelph, ON, Canada.",wordend@uoguelph.ca,,"Worden, David/0000-0002-4147-1453",SWIFT Inc.; Regional Municipality of Durham; City of Hamilton;  [R2B2],SWIFT Inc.; Regional Municipality of Durham; City of Hamilton; ,"This article was prepared by researchers in the Regional and Rural Broadband (R2B2) project at the University of Guelph, Canada who accept all errors and omissions in this paper.

It explores the role of dynamic analytical frames and a reconsideration of the normative principles of information society policies in overcoming these weaknesses. New instruments and policy arrangements that are considered include the establishment of boundary conditions (guardrails) for players, reliance on adaptive forms of policy, and reliance on ethics across all layers of governance. Driven by the global heterogeneity of values and the diversity of historical, economic, political, and cultural conditions, national and global governance arrangements will likely become more multi-centric.

To fill this gap, we utilize municipalities' official reports to offer an empirical evaluation of the financial performance of every municipal fiber project in the U.S. operating in 2010 through 2019. An analysis of the actual performance of the resulting fifteen project panel dataset reveals that none of the projects generated sufficient nominal cash flow in the short run to maintain solvency without infusions of additional cash from outside sources or debt relief. Similarly, 87% have not actually generated sufficient nominal cash flow to put them on track to achieve long-run solvency. In addition, 73% generated negative nominal cash flow over the past three fiscal years, leaving them poorly positioned to make up their deficits and causing them to fall farther into debt. An assessment based on the net present value of these projects' operating cash flow indicates that 53% of projects would not be on track to breakeven even assuming the theoretical best-case performance in terms of capital expenditures and debt service. Close analysis of these projects' performance reveals that revenue generation likely plays a more important role in generating cash flow than efficiency in construction costs or operating efficiency.","[Yoo, Christopher S.] Univ Penn, Annenberg Sch Commun, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Lambert, Jesse] Goodwin Procter LLP, Boston, MA USA; [Pfenninger, Timothy P.] DLA Piper LLP US, Baltimore, MD USA",University of Pennsylvania,"Yoo, CS (corresponding author), Univ Penn, Annenberg Sch Commun, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",csyoo@upenn.edu,,,,,,,34,0,0,0,0,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5961,1879-3258,,TELECOMMUN POLICY,Telecommun.

We find that government policy announcement in general affects telecommunication operators' stock returns negatively, and when the government announces policies with a higher level of interference, the decline in firm value is more pronounced. To understand the comprehensive impact of 5G technology on telecommunication operators, we also examine the effect of institution-driven corporate technology R&D and investment activities on firm value. We find that the firms' 5G activities also decrease their firm value, and this effect is more significant than government policy announcements.

2032,J,"Griffin, R",,,,"Griffin, Rachel",,,New school speech regulation as a regulatory strategy against hate speech on social media: The case of Germany?s NetzDG,TELECOMMUNICATIONS POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Social media regulation; Platform regulation; Content moderation; Hate speech; netzdg,ONLINE HATE; FACEBOOK; RACISM,"Germany's 2017 NetzDG law is an example of 'new school speech regulation' (Balkin, 2014), which restricts speech by coercing intermediaries into censoring users, rather than coercing speakers directly. It is the first such measure which specifically targets hate speech on social media, by requiring large platforms to operate complaints procedures which ensure illegal content is rapidly removed. Numerous other countries have since adopted similar regulations, indicating that states increasingly turn to new school speech regulation as a regulatory strategy to tackle hate speech on social media. This paper aims to evaluate the effectiveness of new school speech regulation in as a regulatory strategy to address online hate speech, taking NetzDG as a case study.A review of relevant empirical literature shows that many features of social media platforms actively promote or encourage hate speech. Key factors include algorithmic recommendations, which frequently promote hateful ideologies; social affordances which let users encourage or disseminate hate speech by others; anonymous, impersonal environments; and the absence of media 'gatekeepers'. In mandating faster content deletion, NetzDG only addresses the last of these, ignoring other relevant factors. Moreover, reliance on individual user complaints to trigger platforms' obligations means hate speech will often escape deletion. Interviews with relevant civil society organisations confirm these flaws of the NetzDG model. From their perspectives, NetzDG has had little impact on the prevalence or visibility of online hate speech, and its reporting mechanisms fail to help affected communities.NetzDG represents an incremental, narrow approach to a complex sociotechnical problem which requires more fundamental regulatory reform. In this regard, it shows the limitations of censorship-based new school speech regulation. Rules which assert state authority by prescribing censorship of narrowly-defined content categories are ill-suited to large-scale, networked, algorithmically-curated social media, where other governance mechanisms influence user behaviour more than content deletion. The paper advocates a more systemic and preventive regulatory approach. Platforms should be required to take public interest considerations into account in all design and governance processes, aiming to shape platform environments to actively discourage users from posting or viewing hate speech, rather than simply deleting it afterwards.","[Griffin, Rachel] Sci Po Paris, Law Sch, Paris, France",,"Griffin, R (corresponding author), Sci Po Paris, Law Sch, Paris, France.",rachel.griffin@sciencespo.fr,,,,,,,151,0,0,5,5,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5961,1879-3258,,TELECOMMUN POLICY,Telecommun.

A shortage of spectrum (or the inefficient assignment of it) is blamed, among other things, for South Africa's relatively slow LTE 4G speeds. Through historical accident, the country has two mobile data networks in addition to the four licensed mobile operators. The response of operators has been to innovate using roaming and network sharing agreements; as we explore in this paper, these have become the de facto spectrum allocation process. This paper looks at how the de facto industry structure has been moulded by spectrum holdings and sharing arrangements and asks how spectrum management could be improved. We observe that, although the number of mobile operators has effectively been reduced to 3 (a number which would raise concern in some circles), there exist a variety of arrangements between those three and other spectrum and network operators. The smallest of the current three mobile operators is still not able to offer a nationwide mobile service without a roaming agreement but, at the same time, the two larger operators depend critically on spectrum and roaming agreements themselves, mainly with the two physical data network operators that function as wholesale providers. The Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA) was established as a consequence of a new constitution that was adopted in 1996 and it helped to create new institutional arrangements for the burgeoning mobile industry. The authority has nevertheless continued to be hampered, as we shall demonstrate, by political imperatives. This has been pointed out by other authors over the past twenty years and we add to this body of evidence by considering the spectrum auction planned (again) for 2021. The 2021'' auction is in fact an iteration of the auction originally announced in May 2010 and then abandoned (Song, 2011). The same thing happened again in 2016 (Paelo & Robb, 2020). Late in 2020, the regulator again announced an auction, due to take place during 2021 but by the second quarter of the year, two of the four national operators had already obtained a court injunction to stop it. The process is intertwined with a political imperative to establish a public wireless open-access network, which we discuss in detail. We describe how the industry has navigated around policy and regulatory dysfunction and how competitive interaction among the South African operators has managed to prevail. Following Hausman & Taylor's (2013) lead in their work on the United States, in this paper we provide a commentary on apparently perverse outcomes from significant regulatory, judicial and legislative actions (or, perhaps more accurately, inactions) governing the South African mobile telecommunications industry from the commencement of the current constitutional arrangements in 1996 to the present.","[Howell, Bronwyn E.] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Management, Wellington, New Zealand; [Howell, Bronwyn E.; Potgieter, Petrus H.] Inst Technol & Network Econ, Cambridge, MA USA; [Potgieter, Petrus H.] Univ South Africa, Dept Decis Sci, Pretoria, South Africa",Victoria University Wellington; University of South Africa,"Potgieter, PH (corresponding author), Univ South Africa, Dept Decis Sci, Pretoria, South Africa.",bronwyn.howell@vuw.ac.nz; potgiph@unisa.ac.za,,"Potgieter, Petrus/0000-0003-1785-761X; Howell, Bronwyn/0000-0001-9048-0674",,,,,73,0,0,0,0,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5961,1879-3258,,TELECOMMUN POLICY,Telecommun.

Mobile phone ownership (MPO) can play a key role in bridging this digital divide and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals of End poverty in all its forms everywhere, Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls, and Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages. Administrative district-level infrastructural and societal readiness to women's MPO in rural settings of Bangladesh may also influence the geospatial variation in their MPO status, which is still unexplained. In the context of rural Bangladesh, household heads substantially exert influence over women's decision-making process. However, the role of household heads' age and education on women's MPO is mostly unexplored. As in developing countries, women's MPO does not ensure its usage, investigating the possibilities of women's MPO on its usage has immense importance. Therefore, this study aims to revisit the correlates of rural women's MPO in Bangladesh and explain the administrative district-level geospatial variation in their MPO by controlling the effect of individual and household-level sociodemographic correlates of MPO. Further, this study attempts to investigate the possibilities of MPO on the extent of its usage. This study used the latest nationally representative crosssectional data from Bangladesh Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey 2019. This study reveals that the district-level readiness was a potential source of geospatial variation in the prevalence of rural women's MPO in Bangladesh. The lowest level of readiness was noticed in north-western Bangladesh. Comparatively elderly women with better education and media exposure had a considerably higher chance of MPO. Elderly household heads, especially male and less educated heads, hindered the MPO of women. This study identified MPO as a key determinant of its extent of usage. Moreover, to increase the MPO by a faster pace, strategies should target less empowered women, particularly those who lived in districts of lower readiness.","[Rahman, Md Mahabubur; Ara, Tasnim] Univ Dhaka, Inst Stat Res & Training, Dhaka 1000, Bangladesh; [Chakma, Rio] North South Univ, Dhaka, Bangladesh; [Rahman, Md Mahabubur] Int Ctr Diarrhoeal Dis Res, Dhaka, Bangladesh",University of Dhaka; North South University (NSU); International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research (ICDDR),"Ara, T (corresponding author), Univ Dhaka, Inst Stat Res & Training, Dhaka 1000, Bangladesh.",mrahman4@isrt.ac.bd; tara@isrt.ac.bd; rio.chakma@northsouth.edu,,"Rahman, Md.

The consideration of the needs of seniors are mainly implemented through social policies while the provision of government services is achieved through digitization policies and procedures. Our research is addressing two objectives. The first objective is to identify the main determinants affecting the adoption of e-government and its use by seniors. The second objective is to build a research framework for assessing e-government policy for the digital inclusion of the seniors from both social and technical perspectives.

Three ICT and three income inequality indicators were used to examine this linkage. The ICT indicators used include internet penetration, mobile phone penetration and fixed broadband subscription, while the income inequality indicators include the Gini coefficient, the Atkinson index and the Palma ratio. Using the Generalised Method of Moments (GMM) estimation technique, the study found that, on the whole, an increase in ICT development unconditionally leads to an increase in economic growth in the countries under study. The study also found that the threshold level of income inequality, which should not be exceeded in order for the positive impact of ICT on economic growth to be sustained, depends on the ICT proxy used and the income inequality indicator. Specifically, the study found that for ICT to have a sustained positive impact on economic growth, i) the Gini coefficient in the mobile penetration specification should not exceed 0.520; ii) the Gini coefficient and Atkinson index in the internet penetration specification should not exceed 0.531 and 0.560, respectively; and iii) the Gini coefficient, Atkinson index and Palma ratio in the fixed broadband subscriptions should not exceed 0.551, 0.633 and 4.664, respectively.

This tax burden encompasses not only standard and special taxes under the control of the Ministry of Finance (MoF) but also fees raised by the national telecommunication Regulatory Agency (RA). Given the lack of financial data at the country level, we build a representative mobile network operator named TELCO, using the GSMA Intelligence database. We compute the Average Effective Tax Rate (AETR) for this firm considering general and special taxes and fees levied only on the telecommunication sector. We develop a web application (https://data.cerdi.uca.fr/telecom/), allowing the reader to replicate our analysis or modify TELCO and tax parameters. The AETR varies significantly across countries, ranging from 33 percent in Ethiopia to 118 pero nt in Niger. Special taxes and fees represent a large share of the AETR, illustrating some taxation by regulation and a potential tax competition (a race to the top) between the MoF and the RA. We compare TELCO's AETR with that of a representative gold mining plant and a standard company with a similar gross return. The tax burden of the telecommunications sector is higher than that of the mining sector in 15 of the 19 countries for which we have data on the gold mining sector.","[Rota-Graziosi, Gregoire; Sawadogo, Faycal] Univ Clermont Auvergne, CERDI, CNRS, F-63000 Clermont Ferrand, France; [Rota-Graziosi, Gregoire; Sawadogo, Faycal] Fdn Etud & Rech Sur Dev Int FERDI, F-63000 Clermont Ferrand, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Clermont Auvergne (UCA),"Sawadogo, F (corresponding author), Univ Clermont Auvergne, CERDI, CNRS, F-63000 Clermont Ferrand, France.",faycal.sawadogo@uca.fr,,,Agence Nationale de la Recherche of the French government through the program Investissements d'avenir [ANR-10-LABX-14-01]; GSMA,Agence Nationale de la Recherche of the French government through the program Investissements d'avenir(French National Research Agency (ANR)); GSMA,"We are thankful to the editor Erik Bohlin and five anonymous referees for their helpful comments on previous versions of the paper.

As a general-purpose technology, 5G can be configured in numerous ways to support innovative applications across many sectors. Smart network applications and services must integrate physical and virtual components in innovative ways. In addition, general capabilities of 5G must be combined with complementary technologies, such as big data analytics and edge cloud services, to create services for specific use cases. Varying throughput and latency requirements of distinct use cases require differentiated technical solutions. Appropriate frequencies must be aligned efficiently with other features within the footprint of particular, local industrial networks. National policy makers, suppliers, and users are responding differently to these governance and management challenges.

The paper finds that telecentres have shifted their concept to provide a wide range of services, both online and offline. The paper indicates that technological, political, and social sustainability are important for the sustainability of telecentres. The paper recommends that we should take the role of state-owned enterprises and the digital transformation into consideration to sustain telecentres.

Significantly, how the digital economy modulates the effects of financial development on trade remains unexplored. Our study addresses these research gaps using panel data from 47 African economies spanning 1990 to 2019. Our findings based on the dynamic system GMM approach show that the direct impacts of financial development and the digital economy have been crucial in driving international trade in Africa in the short and long runs. Second, in the short and long runs, the digital economy serves as a vital channel through which financial development has the most significant impact on trade in Africa. Third, the robustness checks by excluding countries endowed with natural resources in Africa provide robust evidence that digital technology and finance matter for trade. Further, the study discloses an important novelty in that the marginal effects on trade increase when financial development in Africa interacts with the digital economy. In light of these findings, we conclude that policy reforms should focus on policies that encourage the development of the digital economy and its use in the financial sector in Africa.","[Bunje, Madinatou Yeh; Abendin, Simon; Wang, Yin] Zhengzhou Univ, Sch Business, Zhengzhou 450001, Peoples R China",Zhengzhou University,"Wang, Y (corresponding author), Zhengzhou Univ, Sch Business, Zhengzhou 450001, Peoples R China.",zzuwangyin@163.com,,,CNational Planning Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences;  [20FGLB071],CNational Planning Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences; ,Funding Funded by CNational Planning Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences (20FGLB071) .,,63,0,0,8,8,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5961,1879-3258,,TELECOMMUN POLICY,Telecommun.

First, total patents have mutually causal effects with economic growth, but there is no evidence of an impact of total patents on manufacturing sector growth. At the same time, ICT patents have a unidirectional causal impact on both, overall economic growth, and the growth of services and manufacturing. Second, the impact of total patents on economic growth is stronger in advanced economies.

Moreover, the impact of industrial robots applications on the export product quality is dynamic; it initially increases and then decreases. Heterogeneity test results indicate greater quality improvement effects if robots feature applications in high-tech industries. We also show that importing more robots and for extended periods promotes the ef-fects of industrial robots applications on the export product quality upgrades of Chinese enter-prises.

Two unstudied policies of interest are: (1) dig-once policies requiring state-funded construction projects to notify local internet providers about the opportunity to bury conduit for easier wire installation in the future, and (2) permitting policies requiring an expe-ditious response from local jurisdictions regarding the installation of broadband equipment. We use the example of Iowa, which passed legislation on both of these topics in 2015 and compare trends in fiber broadband availability with that of states who did not pass such legislation. We also consider the potential impact on fixed wireless availability, which largely depends upon a fiber middle mile. We use coarsened exact matching at the census tract level to construct treated and control groups with similar pre-2015 demographic characteristics and broadband availability trends in Iowa and other states. Difference-in-difference regression analysis with the matched samples then assesses the policy impact on fiber and fixed wireless availability post-implementation. The results suggest that Iowa's policies increased fiber broadband availability by 2.4%-6.6% when considering eight model specifications which account for different criteria such as geographic region, other (non-dig-once or permitting) broadband policies, and federal funding received. The policies do not appear to have any effect on fixed wireless availability.","[Biedny, Christina; Whitacre, Brian] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Stillwater, OK USA; [Gallardo, Roberto] Purdue Univ, Purdue Ctr Reg Dev, W Lafayette, IN USA",Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus,"Biedny, C (corresponding author), Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Stillwater, OK USA.",cbiedny@okstate.edu,,"Whitacre, Brian/0000-0002-5083-1828; Biedny, Christina/0000-0002-9400-3741",,,,,97,0,0,0,0,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5961,1879-3258,,TELECOMMUN POLICY,Telecommun.

This situation has somehow been changing with, inter alia, the advancement and application of modern Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). In recent years, China has been pushing for the inclusion of its rural communities into modern information society through aggressively digitalizing its rural areas under a public policy umbrella. With the literature's lopsided focus on Western nations, a cohesive paradigm in mapping the Chinese style of universal service implementation remains elusive, a situation that has often obfuscated deeper understanding of the Chinese case from a socioeconomic, technological, or institutional perspective. The main purpose of this present paper lies in the framing and modelling of China's universal service and rural digitalization practices. The paper proposes and applies an integrated offer-agent-target (OAT) framework in a retrospective and empirical examination of the Chinese case and conceptual characterization of what has appeared to be the Chinese model. In so doing, China's universal service development is demarcated into discernible stages that are then pattern-matched with corresponding institutional landscapes. Three salient stages are identified and corresponding institutional landscapes explicated. Finally, insights and suggestions are offered that throws lights on the current issues and future developments.","[Xia, Jun] Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Ctr ICT Ind & Policy Studies, 10 Xi Tu Cheng Rd, Beijing 100876, Peoples R China",Beijing University of Posts & Telecommunications,"Xia, J (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Ctr ICT Ind & Policy Studies, 10 Xi Tu Cheng Rd, Beijing 100876, Peoples R China.",junxia66@hotmail.com,,"Xia, Jun/0000-0003-4856-7770",,,,,51,1,1,5,5,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5961,1879-3258,,TELECOMMUN POLICY,Telecommun.

The projected cost of the government subsidy was originally euro175 million. However, when the contract for the procurement of the NBP was eventually signed in 2019 the estimated subsidy had risen to between euro2.2 and euro2.9 billion. Using a path dependency framework, this paper finds that the escalation in the cost of subsidy was driven by two main factors. First, the decision to roll out fibre-to-the-premises (FTTP) technology was inconsistent with the geographic/legacy path dependencies related to Ireland's low-density rural population. Second, the gap-funding/PPP procurement model adopted for the intervention failed to attract competitive bids and was at odds with the competitive path dependency and the dominant role of the incumbent operator.","[Healy, Gary] Jacobs Cordova & Associates Europe Blackrock Co, Dublin, Ireland; [Palcic, Donal; Reeves, Eoin] Univ Limerick, Kemmy Business Sch, Dept Econ, Limerick, Ireland",University of Limerick,"Palcic, D (corresponding author), Univ Limerick, Kemmy Business Sch, Dept Econ, Limerick, Ireland.",donal.palcic@ul.ie,"Palcic, Donal/K-8682-2016; Reeves, Eoin/K-8034-2016","Palcic, Donal/0000-0003-4726-9640; Reeves, Eoin/0000-0003-4674-3152",,,,,20,0,0,1,2,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5961,1879-3258,,TELECOMMUN POLICY,Telecommun.

Although many scholars have reviewed the existing blockchain research, most of the previous review articles focused on the application of technology or blockchain in specific industries or scenarios, and lacked a comprehensive review of the application of blockchain technology in the business field. Based on a systematic literature review approach and cluster analysis, this study quantitatively analyzed 2830 papers obtained from the Web of Science to fill this gap. By constructing a three-layer research framework, this research enumerates the infrastructure and protocols of blockchain technology in detail, and on this basis develops a three-subjects value creation model. The model highlights that business value can be created from transactions, crypto-economic models, and analytical and automated processes in the interaction of organizations, individuals, and technologies. Different blockchainbased applications solve different kinds of economic problems, including information storage/ sharing, consensus generation and governance. This study expands the blockchain literature and deepens our understanding of how blockchain technology affects organizations and individuals in the business world. The newly proposed research framework can inspire practitioners and managers to discover opportunities for business model innovation.

Therefore, scholars have studied the participation of civil society organizations, from the first phase of the World Summit on the Information Society through to the most recent Internet Governance Forum, to understand how they engage in and shape internet governance. However, this category is not well defined; therefore, it is not always clear whose interests are being advanced by civil society organizations. This study evaluates representation in civil society by examining the annual RightsCon conference as an ideal site of civil society engagement in internet governance in order to evaluate the potential of multistakeholderism to achieve the goals of democratization, representation, and inclusion. Through a meso-level analysis of discursive production at RightsCon that operationalizes a critical geopolitical rubric, this study finds that organizations that represent interests from the Global North and West are highly over-represented in three ways: in leading overall discourse, in claiming authority over global issues, and in driving specific topics such as misinformation, privacy, and internet shutdowns. These findings offer an empirical evaluation of global representation in internet governance, raising the stakes for further study about why and how the category of civil society meets expectations. Finally, conceptual implications are discussed, including evaluating earlier critiques of multistakeholderism as less democratizing in reality than in theory, affirming the analytic value of civil society discourse to policy research, and opening up questions about how a more precise understanding of civil society can contribute to multistakeholderism in internet governance.","[Grover, Rohan] Univ Southern Calif, Annenberg Sch Commun & Journalism, 3502 Watt Way, Suite G6, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",University of Southern California,"Grover, R (corresponding author), Univ Southern Calif, Annenberg Sch Commun & Journalism, 3502 Watt Way, Suite G6, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",rohan.grover@usc.edu,,,,,,,35,0,0,0,0,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5961,1879-3258,,TELECOMMUN POLICY,Telecommun.

While this puzzle persisted for many years, a growing literature has picked it up to examine the effect of ICTs on technical efficiency. However, this literature has focused mainly on quantity-based ICTs measures, which have come under severe criticism in recent times. We advance this literature in this paper by shifting the focus of analysis to quality-based ICTs measures; in this case, Internet quality. We also extend the literature by examining how the envisaged relationship between ICTs quality and technical efficiency is conditioned by a country's unique attributes. Our results show a significantly positive effect of ICTs quality on technical efficiency. We also find that the technical efficiency gains associated with ICTs quality are higher in skill-abundant countries, countries that engage more intensively in cross-border trade, have stronger contracting institutions, and are endowed with well-functioning and well-developed financial markets that ensure greater efficiency of capital allocation. We find a network effect in the nexus between ICTs quality and technical efficiency. That is, the marginal effect of ICTs quality on technical efficiency increases as the number of Internet users expands.

In this research, the influence of mobile payment, a popular payment method emerging in recent years, on rural household consumption is assessed by adopting China Household Finance Survey of 2017. Estimation results under the instrumental variable method suggest that mobile payment has a statistically significant and facilitating effect on rural household consumption in China. This positive effect is attributed to the benefits of mobile payment in improving financial inclusion and the convenience of consumption activities for rural areas, which is verified by performing several disaggregated analyses in our study. This work provides new evidence for the increasing literature on the economic impact of financial technology and several enlightenments for developing countries to improve the quality of public life through information intervention policies.","[Zhang, Jiaping] East China Normal Univ, Fac Econ & Management, Sch Publ Adm, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Huirong] Shandong Management Univ, Sch Lab Relationship, Jinan 250357, Peoples R China; [Gong, Xiaomei] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Publ Econ & Adm, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China",East China Normal University; Shandong Management University; Shanghai University of Finance & Economics,"Gong, XM (corresponding author), Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Publ Econ & Adm, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.",jpzhang@fem.ecnu.edu.cn; zh239@scarletmail.rutgers.edu; xiaom_gong06@163.sufe.edu.cn,,"Gong, Xiaomei/0000-0001-7388-4028; Zhang, Jiaping/0000-0002-0595-7202",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71873095]; National Social Science Foundation of China [18BJY108],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Social Science Foundation of China,This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (71873095) and National Social Science Foundation of China (18BJY108).,,130,5,5,27,27,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5961,1879-3258,,TELECOMMUN POLICY,Telecommun.

In 2019, with widespread territorial disparities, approximately 53.6% people were connected to the Internet worldwide. The majority of the offline user lives in the least developed countries, and only 19% of them use the internet, compared to 87% in developed nations. Sustainable development depends on successful management of open and inclusive urban development, especially in low-income and middle-income countries, where the fastest urbanization is expected to occur by the year 2050. The application of ICT enhances the independence, dignity, and equal opportunities of all people, thereby promoting their integration into society. An inclusive approach-based citizen participation is extremely important for building an inclusive society. Furthermore, this study highlights the current issues and challenges in developing countries, as well as the role of ICT in promoting socio-economic development, where it can serve as a catalyst for the implementation of the concept of sustainable urbanization.

We study transitions from monopoly to duopoly and from duopoly to oligopoly with more than two competitors. Through comparisons across countries and time periods, we isolate factors that explain why duopolistic competition had a larger impact on prices in certain markets than in others. Among other things, we find that two institutional factors played an important role: the way beauty contests for additional licenses were designed and whether duopolists expected additional entry into the network-services market or not.","[Garcia-Vicente, Nicolas] Symphony Media AI, 7730 E Belleview Ave, Greenwood Village, CO USA; [Garcia-Swartz, Daniel D.

In particular, the fast-changing Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has directly led to a far-reaching impact on the production and operation of firms. Many previous studies have discussed the relationship of ICT and the total factor productivity (TFP) of firms, but failed to reach a consistent conclusion. This paper, based on the data of Chinese listed manufacturing firms from 2010 to 2019, explores the impact of ICT on manufacturing firms' TFP and its mechanism, and concludes that ICT have positive correlation with the TFP of manufacturing firms. According to the estimated results of this paper, TFP will increase by about 1.8 % for every 1 % of additional ICT investment. Through channel analysis, this paper finds that the positive effect can be achieved through the following four channels: cutting information search costs, enhancing information processing capabilities, reducing internal capital misallocation, and promoting R&D efficiency. This paper is a supplement to research on firm TFP, provides new micro-evidence for exploring the relationship between ICT and TFP of manufacturing firms, and brings important implications for understanding the role of ICT in firm production activities.","[Li, Dongkun] Cent Univ Finance & Econ CUFE, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Chen, Yufeng; Miao, Jiafeng] Zhejiang Gongshang Univ, Sch Econ, Ctr Studies Modern Business, Hangzhou 310018, Peoples R China; [Chen, Yufeng] Zhejiang Gongshang Univ, Tailong Finance Sch, Hangzhou 310018, Peoples R China; [Chen, Yufeng] Capital Univ Econ & Business, Coll Business Adm, Beijing 100070, Peoples R China",Zhejiang Gongshang University; Zhejiang Gongshang University; Capital University of Economics & Business,"Chen, YF (corresponding author), Zhejiang Gongshang Univ, Sch Econ, Ctr Studies Modern Business, Hangzhou 310018, Peoples R China.",eden_soton@163.com; chenyufeng@gmail.com; miaojiafeng1996@gmail.com,"Dongkun, Li/ABB-8707-2021",,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71673250]; Zhejiang Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars [LR18G030003]; Major Projects of the Key Research Base of Humanities Under the Ministry of Education [14JJD790019]; Zhejiang Philosophy and Social Science Foundation [18NDJC184YB],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Zhejiang Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars; Major Projects of the Key Research Base of Humanities Under the Ministry of Education; Zhejiang Philosophy and Social Science Foundation,"Acknowledgments This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (No.71673250) ; Zhejiang Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars (LR18G030003) ; Major Projects of the Key Research Base of Humanities Under the Ministry of Education (No.14JJD790019) , Zhejiang Philosophy and Social Science Foundation (No.18NDJC184YB) .

Analysis demonstrates how incidentally co-present individuals who are within earshot of one another aurally monitor co-present others and accountably exploit their sensory access to a previously-in-progress interaction for then implementing a recipient-oriented, linguistically fitted action when moving into focused interaction, thereby using overhearing as an occasioned resource for recipient-design.

We discuss how over-exposed self-correction can be used to: (a) remediate errors that might suggest the speaker's incompetence; and (b) redress errors that may be heard as revealing relational evils (implicating inadequate other-attentiveness) or societal evils (conveying problematic social attitudes and prejudices).

On the rare occasions that patients do take the floor midtelling, it is overwhelmingly following surgeons' self-repeats-as-unit-ends, which include gist formulations.

In this article we examine how pain is talked about in 24 video-recorded visits of a team of medical professionals with postsurgery amputees. We identify a paradox: Although it is medically useful to identify postamputation pain (it can indicate problematic healing and deter application of a prosthesis), we found that there was a joint preference, by both patients and professionals, to minimize pain sensations. We show how both parties draw on turn design, sequential organization, and multimodal resources to acknowledge some kinds of unpleasant sensations while excluding types of pain that would be problematic in view of the prosthesis. We discuss the importance of the findings in terms of furthering the understanding of situated expression and reporting of pain, the emergence of local preferences in clinical settings, and preference organization in general.

During triage, nurses elicit patients' problems and gather additional information through history taking and physical examination. This paper examines ways in which triage nurses construct history-taking questions and manage the task of urgency assessment. In video-recordings of triage interactions at an emergency department in Korea, nurses are oriented to building history-taking questions in the direction of ruling out urgency of patients' conditions. First, triage nurses construct questions concerning patients' current symptoms by undercutting their serious nature. Second, nurses also develop questions in search for a possible cause or diagnosis of patients' problems, often proposing a non- or less urgent cause. Findings suggest that nurses may avoid overestimating the level of urgency in triage history taking and prioritize efficiency.

Drawing on everyday adult-child conversational data, this study focuses on question-answer sequences in which the selected child does not respond in a timely or adequate manner and examines how co-present, nonselected adults balance between progressivity and the need to facilitate child participation. The analysis shows that adults tend to manage this balance by prioritizing child participation over progressivity, thereby socializing children to achieve interactional autonomy. This ordering of preferences in adult-child interaction is in contrast with previous findings in adult conversation. This study provides empirical evidence of the ways adults prioritize child participation and socialize children into active responsive participation in conversation.

We directly test and confirm this single-TCU bias by using conversation analysis, corpus linguistics, and Bayesian statistics to assess the conversational subcorpus of the British National Corpus (BNC-C), which contains 475,509 turns of talk. Our results confirm this bias, showing that 67% of turns are composed of single TCUs; we discuss why this estimate is conservative. The mean word length for single-TCU turns was 4.5 (SD = 3.4), compared to 19.9 (SD = 22.6) for multi-TCU turns. Our findings reinforce the ideas that the natural habitat for an accountable social action is the single TCU (vs. the turn), and that interaction is fundamentally organized (i.e., both produced and understood) on an action-by-action basis, which is a TCU-by-TCU basis.

The creation and negotiation of power asymmetries are a common feature of children's peer talk worldwide but analyzed here for the first time among speakers of a traditional Australian language. Analysis suggests that although there are similarities with children from other sociocultural/linguistic contexts, there are differences in these children's choice of membership categories (e.g., husband, country) and how they deploy and react to them (e.g., by ambiguity and by silence respectively). Such differences highlight the connection between language, society, and the interactional resources available to speakers as well as reinforcing the merit of studying membership categorization in children's talk.

In this increasingly common scenario, our study proposes a set of indicators to scrutinize how the public reacts during such hybrid media events, and to test such reactions in light of the mass protests that took place in Spain to mark the 2019 International Women's Day (IWD). We analyze a nationally representative survey sample collected through daily tracking over 20 days before and after the 2019 IWD. Findings confirm the ability of hybrid media protests to broaden their audience, generate interest, spark conversations on gender inequality, and contribute to opinion conformation. They also reveal that some of these reactions were conditioned by prior exposure to similar events and by gender. Our study contributes to a recent line of research testing the influence of protests on the public and shows the possibilities of using rolling cross-sectional designs to capture those effects. The study also contributes to the discussion on the political significance of these mass protests as hybrid media events.","[Jimenez-Sanchez, Manuel] Univ Pablo Olavide Sevilla, Dept Sociol, Seville, Spain; [Fraile, Marta] Inst Polit & Bienes Publ CSIC, Madrid, Spain; [Lobera, Josep] Autonomous Univ Madrid, Sociol, Madrid, Spain; [Lobera, Josep] Tufts Univ, Medford, MA 02155 USA",Universidad Pablo de Olavide; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Instituto de Politicas y Bienes Publicos (IPP); Autonomous University of Madrid; Tufts University,"Jimenez-Sanchez, M (corresponding author), Univ Pablo Olavide Sevilla, Dept Sociol, Seville, Spain.",mjimsan@upo.es,"Lobera, Josep/L-2405-2013","Lobera, Josep/0000-0002-0620-6312; Jimenez-Sanchez, Manuel/0000-0001-5479-8511","FEDER/Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovacion y Universidades-Agencia Estatal de Investigacion [CSO2017-84861-P]","FEDER/Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovacion y Universidades-Agencia Estatal de Investigacion(Spanish Government)","MANUEL JIMENEZ-SANCHEZ is an associate professor in the Department of Sociology at Universidad Pablo de Olavide de Sevilla, Seville, Spain.

Using decades of national public opinion data, we re-examine opinion on race policy in the wake of considerable polarization and shifts in racial attitudes across white partisans. We find that white Democrats have in recent years shown both increasingly liberal racial attitudes and a marked increase in support for policies promoting racial equality that at times rivals the levels of support expressed by Black Americans. We also find, however, that these trends among white Democrats are tempered by heightened levels of racial resentment and continued opposition to racially egalitarian policies among white Republicans. Today, partisans appear to be far more polarized on matters of race and racism than at any point in the last three decades.","[Jardina, Ashley; Ollerenshaw, Trent] Duke Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 140 Sci Dr, Durham, NC 27708 USA",Duke University,"Jardina, A (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 140 Sci Dr, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",ashley.jardina@duke.edu,,,,,,,27,1,1,4,4,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0033-362X,1537-5331,,PUBLIC OPIN QUART,Public Opin.

Given this pervasive concern, US presidents frequently talk about crime, take actions to address it, and list crime prevention efforts among their top accomplishments. We argue that presidents act this way, in part, because fear of crime translates into lowered presidential approval. However, this penalty is not applied evenly. Given the parties' stances toward crime and the criminal justice system, White Americans punish Democratic presidents (i.e., Clinton and Obama) more severely when they are anxious about crime, while Black Americans are more punitive toward Republican presidents (i.e., Bush and Trump). We examine twenty years of survey data and find evidence consistent with our theory. Our results suggest that the relationship between fear of crime and presidential accountability is conditioned by an individual's race and the president's party.","[Noble, Benjamin S.; Reeves, Andrew] Washington Univ, Dept Polit Sci, One Brookings Dr, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Webster, Steven W.] Indiana Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Bloomington, IN USA",Washington University (WUSTL); Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Noble, BS (corresponding author), Washington Univ, Dept Polit Sci, One Brookings Dr, St Louis, MO 63110 USA.",bsnoble@wustl.edu,"Reeves, Andrew/I-4454-2015","Reeves, Andrew/0000-0001-7217-6601",,,,,58,1,1,1,4,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0033-362X,1537-5331,,PUBLIC OPIN QUART,Public Opin.

While it is a frequent claim in the literature that shaming works through domestic politics, we know little about how and when international criticism affects domestic public opinion. We address this question through an originally designed survey experiment in Sweden, which (i) compares the effects of international shaming in two issue areas-human rights and climate change, and (ii) tests whether government responses to criticism moderate the impact of shaming. Our main findings are fourfold. First, we find substantial effects of international shaming on domestic public opinion. These effects hold across both issue areas and irrespective of whether citizens support government parties or not. Second, human rights shaming has a stronger impact on citizens' support for government policies than climate shaming. Third, shaming is most effective among citizens who are more supportive of climate action, human rights, and international cooperation. Finally, our findings are mixed with respect to the effect of government responses. While government responses do not moderate the effects of human rights shaming, they seem to mitigate the effects of climate shaming.","[Koliev, Faradj; Tallberg, Jonas] Stockholm Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Univ Vagen 10F, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Page, Douglas] Gettysburg Coll, Dept Polit Sci, Gettysburg, PA 17325 USA",Stockholm University; Gettysburg College,"Koliev, F (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Univ Vagen 10F, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",faradj.koliev@statsvet.su.se,,,Swedish Research Council for Sustainable Development (Formas) [FR-2019/01587]; Riksbankens Jubileumsfond [M15-0048:1],Swedish Research Council for Sustainable Development (Formas)(Swedish Research Council Formas); Riksbankens Jubileumsfond,"This work was supported by the Swedish Research Council for Sustainable Development (Formas) [grant number FR-2019/01587 to F.K.] and Riksbankens Jubileumsfond [grant number M15-0048:1 to J.T.]. *Address correspondence to Faradj Koliev, Department of Political Science, Stockholm University, Universitetsvagen 10F, 106 91 Stockholm, Sweden; email: faradj.koliev@statsvet.su.se.",,25,0,0,3,3,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0033-362X,1537-5331,,PUBLIC OPIN QUART,Public Opin.

Immigration is a salient and contentious issue in contemporary politics across Europe and is used by Eurosceptic parties in both government and opposition to mobilize support. Public opinion data-drawn from the European Social Survey and the Eurobarometer-reveals the following noteworthy trends over the past two decades. First, positive public attitudes toward immigration have increased across member states, with a temporary setback in 2015-16. Second, immigration is a divisive issue throughout the EU. While public opinion in some regions generally favors immigration, opinion is divided everywhere. Third, despite regional variations between northern, western, and southern Europe, EU-wide trends suggest the emergence of a collective public opinion, crossing national borders. Fourth, despite vocal political opposition to immigration, solid majorities of the public view immigration favorably over time and across regions. To the numerous studies of European public opinion on immigration, this article contributes a useful overview of the long-term trends, with regional and EU-wide presentation and data visualization.","[Banai, Ayelet] Univ Haifa, Dept Govt & Polit Theory, Sch Polit Sci, Haifa, Israel; [Banai, Ayelet] Univ Haifa, Ctr European Studies, Haifa, Israel; [Votta, Fabio] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Commun Res ASCoR, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Seitz, Rosa] Univ Hehenheim, Inst Commun Sci, Stuttgart, Germany",University of Haifa; University of Haifa; University of Amsterdam,"Banai, A (corresponding author), Univ Haifa, Sch Polit Sci, 199 Abba Khoushi Ave, IL-3498838 Haifa, Israel.",abanai@poli.haifa.ac.il,,,,,,,18,0,0,1,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0033-362X,1537-5331,,PUBLIC OPIN QUART,Public Opin.

By implicitly associating the political to male-oriented issues and male-dominated actors and domains, it artificially amplifies the gender gap, particularly by depressing women's reported interest. The first experiment captures respondents' interest through both the standard question about general political interest and a battery of specific political issues, randomizing question order. In the second experiment, an additional text helps reformulate the standard question by prompting respondents to think about politics in broader terms, randomizing the presentation of male-oriented and female-oriented political issues to test the effect of cognitive accessibility and recency. By expanding the conceptualization of the political, the priming applied in our experiments completely closes the gender gap, thereby casting doubt on the validity of the traditional survey instrument.","[Tormos, Raul] Ctr Estudis Opinio Generalitat Catalunya, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain; [Verge, Tania] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Polit & Social Sci Dept, Ramon Trias Fargas 25-27, Barcelona 08005, Catalonia, Spain",Pompeu Fabra University,"Verge, T (corresponding author), Univ Pompeu Fabra, Polit & Social Sci Dept, Ramon Trias Fargas 25-27, Barcelona 08005, Catalonia, Spain.",tania.verge@upf.edu,"Tormos, Raul/V-2440-2017","Tormos, Raul/0000-0002-7861-2221",,,,,58,0,0,7,10,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0033-362X,1537-5331,,PUBLIC OPIN QUART,Public Opin.

We develop a novel survey experiment in which we randomize the race and gender of a victim of police violence, and then provide respondents with an opportunity to establish justice via compensation. We uncover small but consistent effects that financial restitution is most supported for a White female detainee and least supported for a Black female detainee, and this is largely driven by White respondents. Beyond the treatment effects, we show that Black respondents are much more likely to perceive detainees as deserving of restitution; across all treatments, Black respondents are 58 percent more likely than Whites to support a financial settlement. We further show that White respondents' perceptions of deservingness are highly related to their perceptions of who is at fault for the beating-the detainee or the police-and whether the detainee was involved in crime. Black respondents remain likely to award a settlement even if they think the detainee was at fault and involved in crime. Our results provide further evidence that perceptions of who deserves restorative justice for state violence are entangled with race in targeted ways.","[Israel-Trummel, Mackenzie] William & Mary, Govt Dept, POB 8795, Williamsburg, VA 23187 USA; [Streeter, Shea] Univ Michigan, Polit Sci Dept, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Israel-Trummel, M (corresponding author), William & Mary, Govt Dept, POB 8795, Williamsburg, VA 23187 USA.",mit@wm.edu,,"Israel-Trummel, Mackenzie/0000-0002-6663-1329",,,,,107,1,1,2,2,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0033-362X,1537-5331,,PUBLIC OPIN QUART,Public Opin.

Our evidence makes clear that corrections eliminate the effects of misinformation on beliefs about the vaccine, but that neither misinformation nor corrections affect vaccination intention.

While children are often assumed to constitute such a group, their effect on public opinion can be theoretically ambiguous and few studies have tested whether highlighting the child beneficiaries of government programs can alter attitudes toward them. It is also unclear how conceptualizations of children's deservingness vary depending on their race and across segments of the population. Using a nationally representative survey experiment, this study tests the effect of children on attitudes in the context of welfare, a highly politicized and racialized policy domain often associated with the undeserving. More specifically, this study tests whether highlighting the child beneficiaries of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) can alter attitudes toward it, and whether this effect varies by different racial characterizations of the children and across subgroups of the population. I find that doing so boosts support for SNAP overall and across politically influential constituencies, but that this effect is generally less pronounced when children are characterized as black as compared to white or diverse.

The estimated effects are statistically different from zero in unweighted specifications where leaners are excluded from the definition of Republicans and also among respondents who identified as Republicans in previous survey waves. In our second study, we show that an informational intervention reduces the probability that a respondent identifies as an Independent and that including post-treatment partisanship in a regression changes the estimated treatment effect of informational interventions on presidential approval.

This scenario is central to the notion of fiscal illusion and is potentially problematic from a democratic point of view. In this article, I argue that payday is an opportunity for citizens to update their tax preferences. When people are paid and taxed, they are likely to think more about personal consumption relative to public consumption and be more aware of how the current tax system affects their personal finances, leading to increased tax skepticism. Studying this in Denmark, where payday falls on the same day for most people, and using a temporal regression discontinuity design, I find that support for tax cuts goes up by approximately 10 percentage points at payday. Further analyses suggest that this result is not driven by narrow economic self-interest, because the effect does not systematically vary across income groups. Rather, payday seems to mobilize ideological predispositions, as the effect is largest among rightists, for whom taxes are an especially strong political symbol. The implications for opinion formation and democratic accountability are discussed.","[Heide-Jorgensen, Tobias] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Polit Sci, Oster Farimagsgade 5, DK-1353 Copenhagen K, Denmark",University of Copenhagen,"Heide-Jorgensen, T (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Dept Polit Sci, Oster Farimagsgade 5, DK-1353 Copenhagen K, Denmark.",tohj@ifs.ku.dk,,,,,,,72,0,0,3,3,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0033-362X,1537-5331,,PUBLIC OPIN QUART,Public Opin.

We conduct a national survey in Mainland China, where we randomly assign respondents to answer questions about migrants with different skill levels and from either foreign countries or other provinces in China. We find that attitudes cleave over skill level, but the foreign-internal dimension is, on its own, not a salient cleavage in preferences. However, when considering high-skilled migrants, respondents are more supportive of foreign than internal migration; when considering low-skilled migrants, they are more opposed to foreign than internal migration.

Beyond their separate importance, it is a long-standing notion that generalized social trust and political trust are connected in a mutually reinforcing relationship that further undergirds democratic governance. While it is well established that social trust and political trust are robustly positively associated at the individual level, there is much less compelling evidence regarding the causal nature of this relationship. Previous analyses have been unable to adequately rule out confounding and correct for reverse causality. This paper tackles these challenges through data and a research design close to ideally suited for addressing the causal status of the relationship. Using a 20-wave individual-level panel survey from Sweden analyzed using a dynamic panel model, we find evidence for a relatively strong positive causal effect of political trust on social trust, but little evidence for the reverse relationship.","[Dinesen, Peter Thisted] UCL, Dept Polit Sci, London, England; [Dinesen, Peter Thisted] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Polit Sci, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Sonderskov, Kim Mannemar] Aarhus Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Aarhus, Denmark; [Sonderskov, Kim Mannemar] Aarhus Univ, Ctr Expt Philosoph Study Discriminat, Aarhus, Denmark; [Sohlberg, Jacob; Esaiasson, Peter] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Polit Sci, Gothenburg, Sweden",University of London; University College London; University of Copenhagen; Aarhus University; Aarhus University; University of Gothenburg,"Dinesen, PT (corresponding author), Sch Publ Policy, Dept Polit Sci, Rubin Bldg,29-31 Tavistock Sq, London WC1H 9QU, England.",p.dinesen@ucl.ac.uk,,,Danish National Research Foundation [DNRF144]; Carlsberg Foundation [CF18-0637]; Civil Contingencies Agency [2017-2860]; Forte [2017-00604],Danish National Research Foundation(Danmarks Grundforskningsfond); Carlsberg Foundation(Carlsberg Foundation); Civil Contingencies Agency; Forte,"The authors thank Steven Finkel for valuable input.

This launched new frontiers of research, such as studying the effects of presidential approval and economic indices on aggregate party identification. However, the Macropartisanship literature made an important oversight: changes in partisanship between elections are usually from one partisan group to identification as an independent, or vice versa. A single measure of aggregate partisanship, like the original Macropartisanship measure, leaves out independents altogether. This has important theoretical and empirical consequences that are evident in an era of increasingly strong partisanship.

We focus on the ever-increasing role climate change has come to play over the past three decades in shaping how Americans think about broader environmental concerns. We show that news coverage of the environment has focused increasingly on climate change over time, while climate change concurrently has come to dominate all other environmental problems in the strength of its association with general environmental concern in opinion surveys. Panel studies provide evidence that the growing correlation between attitudes on climate change and the environment is predominantly due to the impact of the former on the latter. These developments have been consequential: we estimate that Americans' level of concern about the environment is now both more elevated and more polarized along party lines than if climate change did not occupy its dominant place on the environmental agenda.

This article focuses on perceptions of women's suitability for leadership. To what extent do influential cross-country surveys that include such items suffer from measurement errors stemming from gender of interviewer effects? Building on the literature on social desirability, we expect that respondents are more likely to express preference for men's suitability as political leaders with male interviewers and more likely to state support for women's leadership when interviewed by a woman. We hypothesize that these processes are conditioned by having one's spouse present, by age differences between respondents and interviewers, as well as by respondents' levels of education. Analyzing Afrobarometer data, we generally find support for our claims. In addition, it seems that men are slightly more affected by such effects than women are. These gender of interviewer effects persist when analyzing alternative survey rounds and are insensitive to various fixed effects specifications and robustness tests. For the analysis of survey data, we suggest that researchers using gender-related items should control for gender of interviewer effects.

Using both cross-sectional and panel data, we find that even though Whites have sorted, and differences between the South and elsewhere have diminished over time, Black Americans have not sorted since 1972. However, affective polarization is just as high among Blacks as it is Whites. Thus, sorting does not appear to explain Black affective polarization. Multivariate models provide additional evidence that sorting does not adequately explain affective polarization among Blacks. Instead, we find that group norms and group consciousness (e.g., linked fate) better account for affective polarization among Black Americans. These findings provide important nuance to the sorting thesis and shed light on the relationship between sorting and affective polarization.","[Enders, Adam M.] Univ Louisville, Dept Polit Sci, Ford Hall Rm 205, Louisville, KY 40209 USA; [Thornton, Judd R.] Georgia State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA",University of Louisville; University System of Georgia; Georgia State University,"Enders, AM (corresponding author), Univ Louisville, Dept Polit Sci, Ford Hall Rm 205, Louisville, KY 40209 USA.",adam.enders@louisville.edu,,,,,,,62,0,0,3,6,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0033-362X,1537-5331,,PUBLIC OPIN QUART,Public Opin.

This paper uses a survey experiment to demonstrate the implications of this measurement strategy. Among White Americans, more than one-third of those whom researchers classify as evangelical using the standard double-barreled question actually eschew the evangelical label; the same is true for just under two-thirds of African Americans. Additionally, these born-again non-evangelical Christians hold less conservative political outlooks compared to the self-identified evangelicals with whom they are grouped, and, in fact, oftentimes more closely resemble those who reject both the evangelical and born-again labels. Despite this, the double-barreled identification question produces a White evangelical or born-again group that looks politically similar to a composite evangelical or born-again group based on two questions asking about each identity separately. Finally, important differences appear across race, suggesting that religious and political histories affect how people interpret and respond to double-barreled questions.","[Margolis, Michele F.] Univ Penn, Dept Polit Sci, 133 S 36th St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania,"Margolis, MF (corresponding author), Univ Penn, Dept Polit Sci, 133 S 36th St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",mmargo@sas.upenn.edu,,,"Time-sharing Experiments for the Social Sciences Award [TESS-1204, SES-2017581]",Time-sharing Experiments for the Social Sciences Award,"The author gratefully acknowledges Anthony Correa and Samuel Strickberger for their research assistance, Adam Ziegfeld and members of the American Politics Working Group at the University of Pennsylvania for their feedback on the project, three anonymous reviewers, and the editors for their insightful comments on the manuscript, and Jamie Druckman and Jeremy Freese for accepting the TESS proposal and administering data collection on this project.

We expect that exposure to signals of low comfort with a woman president will reduce perceptions of electability, and in turn dampen support for women at the nomination stage, but there are competing hypotheses for how signals of high comfort will be received. We further expect that Democratic women will be most affected by such information. We test these expectations with an experiment fielded on the 2019 Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES). Our findings have important implications for media coverage of polls related to women running for executive office.","[Demora, Stephanie L.; Lindke, Christian A.; Merolla, Jennifer L.] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Polit Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Stephenson, Laura B.] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Polit Sci, 1151 Richmond St, London, ON N6A 5C2, Canada",University of California System; University of California Riverside; Western University (University of Western Ontario),"Stephenson, LB (corresponding author), Univ Western Ontario, Dept Polit Sci, 1151 Richmond St, London, ON N6A 5C2, Canada.",laura.stephenson@uwo.ca,"Stephenson, Laura/C-5458-2019","Stephenson, Laura/0000-0003-3526-8624; DeMora, Stephanie/0000-0001-8455-9220",,,,,66,0,0,6,6,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0033-362X,1537-5331,,PUBLIC OPIN QUART,Public Opin.

A central tenet of this era of reckoning is that it is no longer acceptable to ignore racist behaviors and expressions. To the extent that active opposition to racial prejudice is an effective strategy for individuals to pursue, we examine individual inclinations to act on matters of racial prejudice. We argue that in spite of best intentions, the motivation to act against racism, what we call antiracism action orientation, can be disrupted by system-justifying beliefs that raise questions about deservingness, legitimize the status quo, and therefore defend inaction. Survey data from the 2020 Congressional Election Study show that antiracism action orientation is strongest among African Americans, and those with more positive affect toward racial-ethnic minorities, and supporters of change. Among Whites, racial resentment dominates the motivations for antiracism to the point that typical political allies like Democrats, liberals, and those who acknowledge White privilege reduce their antiracism action orientation to lower levels than Republicans, conservatives, and deniers of White privilege. We conclude that most Americans, but especially Whites, have a high bar for change, making racism an ongoing American dilemma because of both racial attitudes and the costs of change.","[Davis, Darren W.] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Polit Sci, South Bend, IN USA; [Wilson, David C.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Publ Policy, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Wilson, David C.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Richard & Rhoda Goldman Sch Publ Policy, 2607 Hearst Ave, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of Notre Dame; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Wilson, DC (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Richard & Rhoda Goldman Sch Publ Policy, 2607 Hearst Ave, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",gsppdean@berkeley.edu,,"Wilson, David/0000-0003-2347-739X",,,,,43,1,1,1,1,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0033-362X,1537-5331,,PUBLIC OPIN QUART,Public Opin.

In some accounts there is an expectation that increasing participation and increasing polarization generate an ongoing spiral effect. In this paper we evaluate the over-time relationships between polarization and participation by assessing evidence in existing panel and aggregate data. We find that people with more extreme attitudes are more likely to participate in politics. However, only one particular form of participation-persuading others-appears to predict later levels of polarization. Therefore, only persuasion has the necessary correlation and temporal ordering for a feedback loop with more extreme ideology. The implication is that the discipline should pay more attention to interpersonal persuasion as a form of participation in American politics.","[Argyle, Lisa P.; Pope, Jeremy C.] Brigham Young Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 745 KMBL, Provo, UT 84602 USA; [Pope, Jeremy C.] Brigham Young Univ, Ctr Study Elect & Democracy, Provo, UT 84602 USA",Brigham Young University; Brigham Young University,"Argyle, LP (corresponding author), Brigham Young Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 745 KMBL, Provo, UT 84602 USA.",lpargyle@byu.edu,,,,,,,26,0,0,4,4,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0033-362X,1537-5331,,PUBLIC OPIN QUART,Public Opin.

Despite COVID-19 representing an unprecedented catastrophe, Trump's approval ratings, unlike other world leaders, remained stable throughout 2020. To explore this puzzle, we surveyed the same Americans twice before the 2020 election-a period when COVID cases spiked. Instead of finding that the crisis's severity affected Trump's approval, we find the reverse-perception of the crisis depended on one's prior political predispositions. People who already supported Trump were more likely to underestimate COVID fatalities and case rates, and less likely to perceive the crisis as worsening over time (daily infections doubled between interviews). Those who perceived the crisis to worsen, but continued to support Trump, expressed unwillingness to blame the president. A public so polarized that it fails to acknowledge disaster, or attribute blame, cannot hold its government accountable.","[Freeder, Sean] Univ North Florida, Dept Polit Sci & Publ Adm, Jacksonville, FL USA; [O'Brian, Neil A.] Univ Oregon, Dept Polit Sci, 1284 Univ Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403 USA",State University System of Florida; University of North Florida; University of Oregon,"O'Brian, NA (corresponding author), Univ Oregon, Dept Polit Sci, 1284 Univ Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.",obrian@uoregon.edu,,,,,,,26,0,0,2,2,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0033-362X,1537-5331,,PUBLIC OPIN QUART,Public Opin.

Using five personality measures and a large national sample, our findings affirm that political engagement plays an important moderating role in the relationship between needs for certainty and security and political identification, values, and policy preferences. We find that needs for certainty and security are strongly associated with right-wing political identification and cultural values and policy preferences, particularly among politically engaged citizens. In the economic domain, however, we find that needs for certainty and security are typically associated with left-wing values and policy preferences among politically unengaged citizens. It is only among politically engaged citizens that such needs are associated with right-wing economic values and policy preferences. Our findings confirm the importance of heterogeneity across both ideological domain and political engagement for how psychological needs translate into political ideology in the American mass public.","[Ollerenshaw, Trent] Duke Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 140 Sci Dr,Gross Hall 208, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Johnston, Christopher D.] Duke Univ, Polit Sci, Durham, NC 27708 USA",Duke University; Duke University,"Ollerenshaw, T (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 140 Sci Dr,Gross Hall 208, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",trent.ollerenshaw@duke.edu,,"Ollerenshaw, Trent/0000-0002-3486-0864",Duke University; Worldview Lab at the Kenan Institute for Ethics,Duke University; Worldview Lab at the Kenan Institute for Ethics,This work was funded by research grants awarded to C.D.J. from Duke University and the Worldview Lab at the Kenan Institute for Ethics.,,12,3,3,1,1,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0033-362X,1537-5331,,PUBLIC OPIN QUART,Public Opin.

This has consequences for the measurement of political knowledge in self-administered online surveys. Online surveys may now include answers that were retrieved from the internet instead of a respondent's declarative memory, thereby distorting knowledge measures. This problem has been acknowledged and studied, but existing research focuses on interventions designed to deter online searching and on methods to detect the behavior. I take a different approach and focus on the questions themselves to show that some questions are more vulnerable to bias via internet searching than others. I take advantage of interview mode differences in the 2016 ANES to examine the effect of internet access on different kinds of political knowledge questions. The study concludes with best practices recommendations for researchers wishing to improve their knowledge scales by discussing what type of questions are most likely to form a scale that retains criterion validity in the online environment.","[Kleinberg, Mona S.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Polit Sci, 883 Broadway St, Lowell, MA 01854 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Lowell,"Kleinberg, MS (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Dept Polit Sci, 883 Broadway St, Lowell, MA 01854 USA.",mona_kleinberg@uml.edu,,,,,,,30,0,0,2,2,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0033-362X,1537-5331,,PUBLIC OPIN QUART,Public Opin.

Researchers have largely relied on the hostile sexism scale to measure prejudice against women, and this scale seems particularly relevant to political science research. However, this scale measures attitudes with an agree-disagree response format, which has long been recognized as a source of substantial measurement error. In this paper, we introduce a revised version of the hostile sexism scale that instead relies on an item-specific question format. Across three studies, we show that the item-specific scale is strongly related to the agree-disagree scale, but that the item-specific version reduces problems with truncation and tends to improve discriminant and predictive validity. Given these advantages, we conclude by recommending that researchers adopt the item-specific hostile sexism scale.","[Archer, Allison M.

The experiment signaled the race of the defendant by using distinctively Black and white names, allowing us to assess whether Americans are more punitive toward purportedly Black defendants. We also consider whether signals of the defendant's race condition the effects of the crime and various defendant characteristics. Surprisingly, the direct effect of our signal of defendants' purported race is null. We present evidence that this null finding is a product of offsetting tendencies: respondents who view persistent racial inequalities as the product of both past and ongoing institutional factors prescribed lengthier sentences for white defendants; those who discount these explanations prescribed lengthier sentences for Black defendants. We find only scattered evidence that the signal of defendants' race moderates the effects of other characteristics of the crime and defendant. Our approach and findings not only offer insights into how racial attitudes shape perceptions regarding what constitutes just punishment for crimes in the contemporary United States, but also demonstrate a novel approach to studying this domain and point to an array of promising avenues for future research.","[Doherty, David] Loyola Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Dowling, Conor M.] Univ Mississippi, Dept Polit Sci, 133 Deupree Hall, University, MS 38655 USA; [Miller, Michael G.] Columbia Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Barnard Coll, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Tuma, Michelle D.] Winston & Strawn LLP, New York, NY USA",Loyola University Chicago; University of Mississippi; Columbia University,"Dowling, CM (corresponding author), Univ Mississippi, Dept Polit Sci, 133 Deupree Hall, University, MS 38655 USA.",cdowling@olemiss.edu,,,"University of Mississippi's Office of Research and Sponsored Programs; College of Liberal Arts, and Department of Political Science; National Science Foundation [1948863]","University of Mississippi's Office of Research and Sponsored Programs; College of Liberal Arts, and Department of Political Science; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF))","DAVID DOHERTY is a professor in the Department of Political Science at Loyola University Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.

However, there is little evidence about the relative efficacy of these approaches in this unique context of a pandemic. Using a pair of survey experiments, we examine whether false tags and journalistic factchecks reduce accuracy misperceptions and sharing propensity on social media that can spread false claims. False tags had little effect on subjects' accuracy assessments and social media sharing. Journalistic factchecks that offer accurate information to counter misinformation were more effective in reducing both misperceptions and sharing on social media. Further, we find no evidence of partisan backfire effects, even in response to interventions against claims with a plausible partisan valence. Our results suggest that journalistic factchecks provide an effective counternarrative to COVID-19 misinformation even in the context of the increasing politicization of America's pandemic response and polarization more generally.","[Kreps, Sarah E.] Cornell Univ, Dept Govt, White Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Kriner, Douglas L.] Cornell Univ, Dept Govt, Amer Inst, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Cornell University; Cornell University,"Kriner, DL (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Dept Govt, White Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",kriner@cornell.edu,,,Cornell Atkinson Center for Sustainability,Cornell Atkinson Center for Sustainability,This work was supported by the Cornell Atkinson Center for Sustainability.,,33,1,1,8,14,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0033-362X,1537-5331,,PUBLIC OPIN QUART,Public Opin.

Yet, the political environment surrounding transgender rights has changed significantly since 2015, with increasing public attention to these issues, more prominent position taking by partisan political figures, and substantial shifts in public policy on a wide variety of transgender issues. We examine a wide range of survey items throughout this period to explore how public opinion has evolved over time. Further, using national surveys from 2015 and 2020, we explore whether and how the structure of public opinion may have changed. Our analyses reveal growing support for transgender rights, the increasing importance of political orientations and elite cues in shaping opinion, and substantial variation in attitudes across issues.","[Lewis, Daniel C.] Siena Coll, Dept Polit Sci & Int Relat, 515 Loudon Rd, Loudonville, NY 12211 USA; [Flores, Andrew R.] Amer Univ, Dept Govt, Washington, DC 20016 USA; [Haider-Markel, Donald P.; Miller, Patrick R.] Univ Kansas, Dept Polit Sci, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Taylor, Jami K.] Univ Toledo, Dept Polit Sci & Publ Adm, 2801 W Bancroft St, Toledo, OH 43606 USA",American University; University of Kansas; University System of Ohio; University of Toledo,"Lewis, DC (corresponding author), Siena Coll, Dept Polit Sci & Int Relat, 515 Loudon Rd, Loudonville, NY 12211 USA.",dlewis@siena.edu,,,,,,,58,1,1,3,3,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0033-362X,1537-5331,,PUBLIC OPIN QUART,Public Opin.

Various statistical methods (e.g., cluster analysis) have been proposed to detect falsifiers. These methods often rely on falsification indicators aiming to measure differences between real and falsified data. However, due to a lack of real-world data, empirical evaluations and comparisons of different statistical methods and falsification indicators are scarce. Using a large-scale nationally representative refugee survey in Germany with known fraudulent interviews, this study tests, evaluates, and compares statistical methods for identifying falsified data. We investigate the use of new and existing falsification indicators as well as multivariate detection methods for combining them. Additionally, we introduce a new and easy-to-use multivariate detection method that overcomes practical limitations of previous methods. We find that the vast majority of used falsification indicators successfully measure differences between falsifiers and nonfalsifiers, with the newly proposed falsification indicators outperforming some existing indicators. Furthermore, different multivariate detection methods perform similarly well in detecting the falsifiers.","[Schwanhaeuser, Silvia; Sakshaug, Joseph W.; Kosyakova, Yuliya] Inst Employment Res IAB, Nurnberg, Germany; [Schwanhaeuser, Silvia; Sakshaug, Joseph W.; Kosyakova, Yuliya] Univ Mannheim, Baden Wurttemberg, Switzerland; [Sakshaug, Joseph W.] Ludwig Maximilian Univ Munich, Munich, Germany; [Kosyakova, Yuliya] Otto Friedrich Univ Bamberg, Bamberg, Germany",University of Munich; Otto Friedrich University Bamberg,"Schwanhauser, S (corresponding author), Inst Employment Res IAB, Nurnberg, Germany.;Schwanhauser, S (corresponding author), Univ Mannheim, Baden Wurttemberg, Switzerland.",Silvia.Schwanhaeuser2@iab.de,"Kosyakova, Yuliya/J-6873-2019","Kosyakova, Yuliya/0000-0002-9621-1755; Schwanhauser, Silvia/0000-0001-5103-2449; Sakshaug, Joseph/0000-0001-7520-353X",,,,,64,0,0,1,3,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0033-362X,1537-5331,,PUBLIC OPIN QUART,Public Opin.

We consider the case of Teach For America (TFA), a prominent alternative teacher preparation provider with an admissions process that generates quasi-random variation in applicants' likelihood of being a teacher. We leverage this variation using a regression discontinuity design and collect outcome data by surveying TFA applicants regarding education inequality and reform. We find that teaching in underserved schools leads individuals to favor more structural as opposed to individualistic explanations for poor student outcomes. When asked to evaluate education reform strategies to address education inequality, we find that these teachers are more likely to support policy prescriptions that improve both student outcomes and teachers' working conditions, namely investments that expand access to school-based services (e.g., meals, counselors) for low-income children. Similarly, teaching experience causes no change in support, and in some cases, less support for policy levers that do not unambiguously improve student outcomes or teachers' working conditions, such as market-based school reforms. Moreover, experience in the classroom cultivates greater optimism in the potential of educators and schools.","[Conn, Katharine M.] Columbia Univ, Teachers Coll, Consortium Policy Res Educ, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Lovison, Virginia S.] Harvard Grad Sch Educ, Cambridge, MA USA; [Mo, Cecilia Hyunjung] Univ Calif Berkeley, Polit Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Mo, Cecilia Hyunjung] Goldman Sch Publ Policy, Publ Policy, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",Columbia University; Columbia University Teachers College; Harvard University; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Mo, CH (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Polit Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Mo, CH (corresponding author), Goldman Sch Publ Policy, Publ Policy, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",cecilia.h.mo@berkeley.edu,,,Vanderbilt University's Discovery Grant Program; Berkeley Institute for Young Americans [CAMHPPBT03],Vanderbilt University's Discovery Grant Program; Berkeley Institute for Young Americans,"KATHARINE M.

However, less attention has been paid to how social psychological factors such as views of deservingness mediate that relationship. This manuscript highlights how identity, deservingness, and views of justice affect attitudes about symbolic reparations-a step that many believe is necessary to achieve closure and pave a path for racial equality. Using survey data from an opt-in sample, we demonstrate how both in-group pride and myths of undeservingness of Black Americans function through racial identity to uniquely affect a respondent's understanding of the lasting harms of slavery. Increases in pride result in opposition to symbolic reparations among white Americans, but they lead to support among Black Americans and Latinx Americans. Racial/ethnic pride has no impact on support for such reparations among Asian Americans. We find that agreement with myths of Black Americans' undeservingness largely explains the effect of pride among white Americans but not among racialized minority groups, and we argue that this is largely due to the socio- historical context of their identities. We conclude by discussing the implications this has for reparations as a form of justice 155 years after formal slavery ended in the United States.","[REICHELMANN, A. S. H. L. E. Y., V; ROOS, J. M.

What is in need of scholarly inquiry is how marginalized groups struggle to assert the legitimacy and authenticity required to influence collective decision-making when appraisals of worth are predicated on the cultural context that marginalizes them. This essay explicates legitimacy and authenticity alongside culture and marginality to investigate the specific advocacy challenges that marginalized groups face. Ultimately, it presents theoretical extensions for FFST, urges PR to consider the differences between facilitational and representational advocacy approaches for marginalized groups, and encourages PR scholarship and practice to legitimize lived experience. While this essay primarily draws examples from a specific marginalized group within mental health advocacy, consumers/survivors/ex-patients, it also offers reflections for other marginalized groups.","[Aghazadeh, Sarah A.] Auburn Univ, Sch Commun & Journalism, 232 Tichenor Hall, Auburn, AL 36849 USA",Auburn University System; Auburn University,"Aghazadeh, SA (corresponding author), Auburn Univ, Sch Commun & Journalism, 232 Tichenor Hall, Auburn, AL 36849 USA.",saa0056@auburn.edu,,,,,,,73,0,0,1,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1062-726X,1532-754X,,J PUBLIC RELAT RES,J.

We examine how authenticity in CSR communication predicts the four dimensions of quality OPRs. Results of CFA reveal that authenticity in CSR communication comprises three dimensions - genuineness, reflection of true identity, and consistency. Hierarchical regression analyses indicate that authenticity in CSR communication predicts trust, commitment, satisfaction, and control mutuality. Major theoretical contributions of the study include: (1) Authenticity in CSR communication is an OPR antecedent. (2) The genuineness aspect of authenticity provides important implications for company-cause fit research on CSR communication.

Public discourse now plays an essential role in shaping organizational policy and practice. This article posits that in response, public relations must take a next turn theoretically in a way that prioritizes the public voice. As such, guided by the perspectives of LGBTQIA advocacy leaders in the post-Obergefell (post-marriage-equality) era, this article argues that the field must shift from a focus on relationship management to one on change empowerment. In so doing, it contends that if we are going to truly take a next turn to focus on the public in this post-2020 context, then theoretically we must better-address the influence and process of change - emanating from internal and external forces. This article also contends that while public relations certainly remains a management function, the lessons from 2020 mandate that we question our field's focus on managing relationships and instead investigate how public relations can become a source of empowerment.","[Mundy, Dean] Univ Oregon, Sch Journalism & Commun, Eugene, OR 97403 USA",University of Oregon,"Mundy, D (corresponding author), Univ Oregon, Sch Journalism & Commun, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.",dmundy@uoregon.edu,,,,,,,93,1,1,1,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1062-726X,1532-754X,,J PUBLIC RELAT RES,J.

This study exposes for the first time a unique form of epistemic subsidies, suggesting a new explanation for PR-journalists' paradoxical relations. Using a mix of quantitative and qualitative reconstructions, in which Israeli news reporters from national news outlets accounted for the sources they used (N = 1,147), this paper reaffirms the persistence of the paradox, while shedding new light on it, showing that the relationship is based on reliability rather than trust. Information from PR sources is communicated to journalists in a significantly more reliable way than from non-PR - making reliance much safer. Analyzing the findings with a framework that is based on social epistemology and the intereffication theory, the paper suggests that the epistemically-virtues practices of PR act as inductions, which could result from an adaptation to journalists' increasing epistemic needs. Findings also reopen the normative debate about the implication of reliance on PR, indicating that such reliance reduces vulnerability to factually incorrect messages, while not defending journalists from misleading messages or spins.","[Barnoy, Aviv] Zefat Acad Coll, Dept Informat Syst, Safed, Israel; [Barnoy, Aviv] Univ Haifa, Dept Philosophy, Haifa, Israel",University of Haifa,"Barnoy, A (corresponding author), Univ Haifa, Dept Philosophy, Haifa, Israel.",avivbarnoy@gmail.com,,"Barnoy, Aviv/0000-0002-6067-7094",Israel Science Foundation [650/18],Israel Science Foundation(Israel Science Foundation),This work was supported by the Israel Science Foundation [650/18].,,69,0,0,3,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1062-726X,1532-754X,,J PUBLIC RELAT RES,J.

Through an online survey of 439 employees in the United States, this study found that perceived bridging strategies effectively induced employees' openness to change, which in turn resulted in stronger behavioral compliance, cooperation, and championing for change. By contrast, while a perceived buffering strategy had a direct and positive association with employees' compliance and cooperation, it did not enhance employees' championing for change.

The study results advance the organizational listening literature and contribute to the growing body of knowledge on artificial intelligence in public relations.","[Men, Linjuan Rita] Univ Florida, Dept Publ Relat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Zhou, Alvin] Univ Minnesota, Hubbard Sch Journalism & Mass Commun, Minneapolis, MN USA; [Tsai, Wan-Hsiu Sunny] Univ Miami, Dept Strateg Commun, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Miami,"Men, LJR (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Dept Publ Relat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",rmen@ufl.edu,"Zhou, Alvin/L-3760-2019","Zhou, Alvin/0000-0001-5410-9712; tsai, wanhsiu/0000-0003-3124-6882; Men, Linjuan Rita/0000-0002-5770-1647",Arthur W.

Habitus, intersectionality and QOC critique provide a theoretical framework that informs analysis. Advocacy, representation and empowerment are identified as important themes that characterize the experiences of our participants. Structural, representational and political intersectionality emerged as key reasons for their public relations work.

Drawing from critical theorists Arendt and Mouffe, it centers pluralism, agonism, deliberation, and reflection as central to listening and delineates the functions and values of civic listening to add to existing architectures. In doing so it provides additional guidance to help organizations (1) listen for what might be challenging for leaders to hear, (2) ensure values of deliberation and pluralism are enacted in listening contexts, and (3) help better triangulate organizational awareness among a diverse constellation of other organizations and stakeholders. Building on organizational listening scholarship that addresses the potential for the concept's contributions to democratic society, this new perspective points toward deeper, more nuanced, and more equitable organizational engagement in civic discourse and firmer ground for contentious issue involvement. It introduces five critical values within an architecture of civic listening to guide practice: other orientation, pluralistic engagement, harmony over consensus, reflective processes, and social problem-solving focus.","[Capizzo, Luke] Univ Missouri, Sch Journalism, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Feinman, Meredith] James Madison Univ, Sch Commun Studies, Harrisonburg, VA 22807 USA",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia; James Madison University,"Capizzo, L (corresponding author), Univ Missouri, 001D Reynolds Journalism Inst, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",capizzol@missouri.edu,,"Capizzo, Luke/0000-0002-5813-8219",Page Legacy Scholar Grant from the Arthur W.

This study examines the necessity for and potential efficacy of the amendment, Article 23, through a comparative analysis of emerging legislative and regulatory approaches in France, the UK, Canada, Utah, and Germany, and through a survey of French 15-, 16-, and 17-year-olds. Among other things, our survey shows that 41% of 15-, 16-, and 17-year-olds in France visit dedicated pornographic sites, on average monthly and often much more frequently. However, the range of media platforms via which French adolescents are exposed to pornography, their knowledge about technologies that could circumvent age verification, and the power, scope, and implementation of Article 23 may limit the legislation's efficacy. Our findings suggest the mechanisms that may limit its efficacy include media displacement, socio-technical circumvention, and the Article's relatively broad and imprecise nature. This study has implications for legislators and regulators in democratic countries beyond France as they too grapple with the challenges of regulating online pornography. Furthermore, it extends the often contradictory and/or limited evidence that exists about adolescents' consumption of pornography.","[Thurman, Neil] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Media & Commun, Oettingenstr 67, D-80538 Munich, Germany; [Thurman, Neil] City Univ London, Dept Journalism, London, England; [Nalmpatian, Asmik] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Stat, Munich, Germany; [Obster, Fabian] Univ Bundeswehr Munchen, Fak Betriebswirtschaft, Munich, Germany",University of Munich; City University London; University of Munich; Bundeswehr University Munich,"Thurman, N (corresponding author), Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Media & Commun, Oettingenstr 67, D-80538 Munich, Germany.",neil.thurman@ifkw.lmu.de,,"Obster, Fabian/0000-0002-6951-9869",Projekt DEAL,Projekt DEAL,Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.,,37,0,0,4,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1944-2866,,,POLICY INTERNET,Policy Internet,SEP,2022,14,3,,,,,690,710,,10.1002/poi3.293,0,,44652,21,Communication; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication; Government & Law,4V0WE,,"hybrid, Green Accepted",,,44885,WOS:000777914600001,0

This article provides a comprehensive account of hypernudging-dynamically personalized user steering, which represents the next generation user influencing techniques online, with the potential to lead to multifaceted individual and collective harms. However, problematizing the phenomenon for digital policy purposes is not a straightforward task. Due to the complexity and opaqueness of its underlying mechanisms and effects, policymakers are operating under conditions of uncertainty, necessitating a shared understanding of what impact hypernudging has on users as well as crafting a shared vision of values that ought to be embedded and safeguarded in digital choice architectures.

We do not know whether the local units of political parties are nowadays active players in the most important communication sphere, and nor do we know anything about potential driving forces of their activities on social media. Using big data, we are able to demonstrate that local party units in Germany are especially active on Facebook during a heated election campaign. Interestingly, we also confirm this observation with regard to user activities. Furthermore, our results reveal that the local basis of the German right-wing populist party Alternative for Germany has an insurmountable lead on Facebook-in terms of both published posts and user response. This finding supports the thesis that a right-wing ecosystem on Facebook has been established in Germany. Besides election and party effects, we find that urbanized areas provide better opportunities for the social media usage of political parties and citizens.","[Datts, Mario] Univ Hildesheim, Inst Social Sci, Dept Polit Sci, Hildesheim, Germany; [Schultze, Martin] SayWay GmbH, Cologne, Germany",University of Hildesheim,"Datts, M (corresponding author), Univ Hildesheim, Inst Social Sci, Hildesheim, Germany.",mario.datts@uni-hildesheim.de,,"Datts, Mario/0000-0003-4076-3224",Projekt DEAL,Projekt DEAL,Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.,,56,0,0,2,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1944-2866,,,POLICY INTERNET,Policy Internet,JUN,2022,14,2,,,SI,,468,484,,10.1002/poi3.294,0,,44621,17,Communication; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication; Government & Law,2H3NL,,,,,44885,WOS:000771789000001,0

This spans across governance from the state through government interventions and introduction of formal law, governance in the industry through sector-based guidelines and best practice recommendations, and governance in the vernacular from peer surveillance and the court of public opinion in civil society. Through mixed qualitative methodologies including traditional and digital participant observation, content analysis, archival research, document survey, and case study files, this paper aims to locate the current terms and boundaries of influencer governance and regulation in the verticals of race & culture and sex & safety. In race & culture, we consider how the majority-race Chinese influencers and minority-race Malay and Indian influencers are differently policed by the three tiers of governance, and experience uneven consequences. This includes commentary that is overtly racist, poor stereotypes that perpetuate everyday racism, and parody content that calls out systemic racism. In sex & safety, we consider how sexual harassment and assault are regulated in the industry. This includes the underbelly of the industry where some prominent influencers-cum-managers have been accused of sexual grooming and advances as part of their recruitment processes. It highlights how when women are provided an anonymous space to discuss sexual harassment, a tidal wave of stories emerge, leading to doxxing and the potential for vigilante justice. It also reveals how LGBT influencers and sexual offenders are policed more harshly, while sexual harassment against women take place without repercussion even when revealed. We end with a consideration of the state of influencer wellbeing and welfare in the industry, and the place of the law in regulating longstanding and emergent issues.","[Radics, George] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, 11 Arts Link,03-06 AS1, Kent Ridge 117573, Singapore; [Abidin, Crystal] Curtin Univ, Dept Internet Studies, Perth, WA, Australia",National University of Singapore; Curtin University,"Radics, G (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, 11 Arts Link,03-06 AS1, Kent Ridge 117573, Singapore.",socrgb@nus.edu.sg,,"Radics, George/0000-0002-7923-8366; Abidin, Crystal/0000-0002-5346-6977",Australian Research Council [DE190100789],Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"Australian Research Council, Grant/Award Number: DE190100789",,106,0,0,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1944-2866,,,POLICY INTERNET,Policy Internet,SEP,2022,14,3,,,,,597,617,,10.1002/poi3.320,0,,44805,21,Communication; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication; Government & Law,4V0WE,,,,,44885,WOS:000853374700001,0

However, the public sphere is often viewed as a static space; little attention is given to the complex processes through which topics are raised, debated, and refined by the public through this discussion. This study conceptualizes the public sphere as a problematization process and proposes a novel framework combining a four-phase process analysis together with content analysis to analyze public deliberation process on social media. A case study is conducted of public discussion on Sina Weibo about municipal policy in Hangzhou, China. Data generated using the framework illustrate how social media function as a filtering mechanism, channeling salient public opinions from civil society to decision-making bodies in the center of the politicolegal system, where these opinions play a role in policy decision-making. This paper provides analytic leverage for understanding the relevance of public sphere theory to policymaking processes.","[Chen, Qinying; Jacobson, Tom] Temple Univ, Klein Coll Media & Commun, Annenberg Hall Room 334,2020 N 13th St, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University,"Chen, QY (corresponding author), Temple Univ, Klein Coll Media & Commun, Annenberg Hall Room 334,2020 N 13th St, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA.",tug17796@temple.edu,,"Chen, Qinying/0000-0002-2136-3789",,,,,41,0,0,11,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1944-2866,,,POLICY INTERNET,Policy Internet,JUN,2022,14,2,,,SI,,485,502,,10.1002/poi3.281,0,,44562,18,Communication; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication; Government & Law,2H3NL,,,,,44885,WOS:000741472300001,0

In this article, we examine how various levels of the Chinese government (central, provincial, and municipal) communicated with the public in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Analyzing government social media posts during the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan (text as data), we conduct topic modeling analysis and identify four strategies that characterize Chinese governments' responses to a variety of issues at the ground level, which we label instructing information, adjusting information, advocacy, and bolstering. The results show that local government agencies predominantly used the first two strategies, whereas the central government mainly relied on the last two. These strategies explain how various levels of government engaged in agile governance through their communication with citizens, highlight the coordination and control work undertaken by governments at all levels, and demonstrate how these methods shielded the central government from blame for the pandemic.","[Li, Yiran; Fan, Yingying] Univ Macau, Dept Govt & Publ Adm, Fac Social Sci, Taipa, Macau, Peoples R China; [Chandra, Yanto] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Appl Social Sci, Fac Hlth & Social Sci, Hung Hom,Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",University of Macau; Hong Kong Polytechnic University,"Chandra, Y (corresponding author), Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Appl Social Sci, Fac Hlth & Social Sci, Hung Hom,Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",yanto.chandra@polyu.edu.hk,"Chandra, Yanto/N-6238-2014","Chandra, Yanto/0000-0003-1083-5813; LI, YIRAN/0000-0001-6547-5574; Fan, Yingying/0000-0003-0801-1401",Start-up Research Grant of University of Macau [SRG201900152-FSS],Start-up Research Grant of University of Macau,"The Start-up Research Grant of University of Macau, Grant/Award Number: SRG201900152-FSS",,105,1,1,24,61,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1944-2866,,,POLICY INTERNET,Policy Internet,SEP,2022,14,3,,,,,651,672,,10.1002/poi3.282,0,,44531,22,Communication; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication; Government & Law,4V0WE,,Bronze,,,44885,WOS:000734461200001,0

The Australian Government's Smart Cities Plan and Regional Connectivity Program includes Smart Investment in regional areas and the New South Wales Government has prioritised connectivity and telecommunications infrastructural development through the Regional Digital Connectivity program. And yet regional and rural communities are typically excluded from the evidence base for smart technologies and services. Local Aboriginal Land Councils are also important stakeholders in managing the digital processes associated with information and infrastructure moving across different Countries. This paper draws on data from the 'It just works!': Regional and rural consumer understandings of smart technologies in North West New South Wales project, including over 130 survey responses and interviews with shire councillors, land councillors, and consumers on smart development and Internet infrastructure in the region. In the areas surveyed, smart regional policy is variously emerging, non-existent, or assembled from existing policy domains and regulation involving the Internet, telecommunications, regional development, First Nations, and local government.

Given that Google Analytics (GA) is a popular tool for collecting and analyzing digital trace data, this article asks to what extent GA is useful in usability evaluation for assessing inclusivity. This article reports on a case study in which GA was used for the usability evaluation of an online participation platform of a local government in The Netherlands. The usability evaluation via GA highlights that the platform was less inclusive toward two categories of users, namely, mobile users and users who access the platform via social media or referral. We conclude that GA is helpful for assessing inclusivity in online government platforms, particularly to the extent that it can be used to monitor whether there are differences in usability for different categories of users. Shortcomings of GA are that it gives limited insights into underlying reasons for identified behavioral patterns, that data quality can be compromised, and that functionalities of GA are restricted based on privacy or legal considerations.","[van den Berg, Annelieke C.; Giest, Sarah] Leiden Univ, Fac Governance & Global Affairs, Inst Publ Adm, Turfmarkt 99, NL-2511 DP The Hague, Netherlands; [Kraaij, Wessel] Leiden Univ, Leiden Inst Adv Comp Sci LIACS, Leiden, Netherlands",Leiden University; Leiden University - Excl LUMC; Leiden University; Leiden University - Excl LUMC,"van den Berg, AC (corresponding author), Leiden Univ, Fac Governance & Global Affairs, Inst Publ Adm, Turfmarkt 99, NL-2511 DP The Hague, Netherlands.",a.c.van.den.berg@fgga.leidenuniv.nl,,,,,,,51,0,0,5,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1944-2866,,,POLICY INTERNET,Policy Internet,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1002/poi3.328,0,,44835,23,Communication; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication; Government & Law,5F1XR,,,,,44885,WOS:000866115600001,0

The backdrop to this 'neo-regulatory development has been Brexit (the UK's withdrawal from the European Union). In late 2021, for the first time, the DRCF became a serious focus of parliamentary scrutiny, with recommendations for reform.

This article analyzes the social struggles surrounding passage of the Olimpia Law of 2019, which criminalizes digital violence in Mexico. Although criminalization of digital violence as a means of governing online behavior has recently attracted much attention globally, this study proposes that such measures can, at the same time, put at risk the human rights of women actively participating in the political realm (human rights defenders, activists, and journalists). I further contend that governing digital violence is not so much a regulatory question but should, rather, be understood as a field of struggle among diverse collective projects. Thus, I argue that there is a need to further reconceptualize digital violence against women in politics as a way to address the multiplicity of actors and perspectives involved in internet governance. Following textual analysis of documents from feminist organizations arguing against the criminalization of digital violence, I conclude by proposing public policies to fight this phenomenon beyond criminalization.","[Estrada, Marcela Suarez] Free Univ Berlin, Lateinamer Inst, Rudesheimer Str 54-56 Raum 236, D-14197 Berlin, Germany",Free University of Berlin,"Estrada, MS (corresponding author), Free Univ Berlin, Lateinamer Inst, Rudesheimer Str 54-56 Raum 236, D-14197 Berlin, Germany.",marcela.suarez@fu-berlin.de,,"Suarez Estrada, Marcela/0000-0003-2412-5214",Berliner Programm zur Forderung der Chancengleichheit fur Frauen in Forschung und Lehre (BCP); Das Berliner Hochschulprogramm DiGiTal Digitalisierung : Gestaltung und Transformation,Berliner Programm zur Forderung der Chancengleichheit fur Frauen in Forschung und Lehre (BCP); Das Berliner Hochschulprogramm DiGiTal Digitalisierung : Gestaltung und Transformation,Berliner Programm zur Forderung der Chancengleichheit fur Frauen in Forschung und Lehre (BCP); Das Berliner Hochschulprogramm DiGiTal Digitalisierung : Gestaltung und Transformation,,52,0,0,7,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1944-2866,,,POLICY INTERNET,Policy Internet,JUN,2022,14,2,,,SI,,410,423,,10.1002/poi3.277,0,,44531,14,Communication; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication; Government & Law,2H3NL,,Green Published,,,44885,WOS:000730308700001,0

We argue that influencers in China are in a relatively precarious position due to various regulations and restrictions imposed upon them by the state, platforms, and industry associations. They are frequently targeted in China's internet governance campaigns for a more sanitary internet and coerced to participate in social governance for the creation of a better socialist society. They are therefore vulnerable within China's state-controlled digital economy, caught between risks and opportunities this governance affords. Their position in this governance regime has consequently enabled their creativity, flexibility, and resilience to play on the edge of recurring platform crackdowns and capricious government policies to survive in the ever-changing influencer industry. The coevolution of regulatory policies and focuses, and the shifting performativity of influencers, also makes China's influencer culture fast evolving and the governance itself more complex than elsewhere.","[Xu, Jian] Deakin Univ, Sch Commun & Creat Arts, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Qu, Lina] Michigan State Univ, Dept Linguist Languages & Cultures, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Zhang, Ge] City Univ Hong Kong, Sch Creat Media, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Deakin University; Michigan State University; City University of Hong Kong,"Zhang, G (corresponding author), City Univ Hong Kong, Sch Creat Media, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",playbourer@outlook.com,,"Zhang, Ge/0000-0001-8317-4185",,,,,60,0,0,5,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1944-2866,,,POLICY INTERNET,Policy Internet,SEP,2022,14,3,,,,,525,540,,10.1002/poi3.318,0,,44805,16,Communication; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication; Government & Law,4V0WE,,,,,44885,WOS:000853743300001,0

The results of this qualitative study emphasize that not being able to use the Internet negatively impacts feelings of belonging and self-confidence. Citizens need to invest continually in new or different equipment and in skills to keep up. Opportunities to invest are shaped at the nexus of gender, class, educational level, and occupational status. Therefore, simply training people in particular digital skills is insufficient.

However, studies in this area have been conducted mainly in wealthy countries, with municipalities that are capable of supporting migrants or refugees. There is less evidence from middle-income host countries and how ICTs can help migrants in their resettlement efforts. To address this gap, this study examines ICT access and the use of e-government services by Venezuelan migrants in Colombia and compares this group with short- and long-term residents of Bogota. The descriptive analysis of the data reveals that, after controlling for demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, foreign migrants are less likely to own ICT devices compared to short- and long-term residents, but over time do acquire ICT access. In addition, Venezuelan migrants are less likely to use e-government services than their local peers even after controlling for demographic characteristics and internet access, with the exception of address registration. The results indicate that ICT access is not a sufficient condition for migrants to access e-government services and there is a need for policy coordination to reduce bureaucratic red tape that may diminish migrants' likelihood of accessing to e-government services.","[Martin-Shields, Charles P.; Ruhe, Constantin] Deutsch Inst Entwicklungspolit DIE, German Dev Inst, Tulpenfeld 6, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Camacho, Sonia; Taborda, Rodrigo] Univ Los Andes, Sch Management, Bogota, Colombia; [Ruhe, Constantin] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Fac Social Sci, Frankfurt, Germany",Deutsches Institut Entwicklungspolitik (DIE); Universidad de los Andes (Colombia); Goethe University Frankfurt,"Martin-Shields, CP (corresponding author), Deutsch Inst Entwicklungspolit DIE, German Dev Inst, Tulpenfeld 6, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",Charles.Martin-Shields@die-gdi.de,"Taborda, Rodrigo/K-2202-2013","Taborda, Rodrigo/0000-0002-3961-6852; Martin-Shields, Charles/0000-0002-1039-5208; Camacho, Sonia/0000-0002-3662-1402",Bundesministerium fur Wirtschaftliche Zusammenarbeit und Entwicklung [9000702],Bundesministerium fur Wirtschaftliche Zusammenarbeit und Entwicklung,"Bundesministerium fur Wirtschaftliche Zusammenarbeit und Entwicklung, Grant/Award Number: 9000702",,44,0,0,8,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1944-2866,,,POLICY INTERNET,Policy Internet,JUN,2022,14,2,,,SI,,450,467,,10.1002/poi3.280,0,,44531,18,Communication; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication; Government & Law,2H3NL,,hybrid,,,44885,WOS:000728834200001,0

The professionalization of content production has become particularly visible on YouTube, where influencers and brands frequently hire intermediary creators to assist in or outsource the production of videos. Screenwriters and editors work behind the scenes to support the constant stream of fresh content required to gain visibility. While playing a vital role in the production process, in Japan, these intermediary creators are too often underpaid and uncredited. As a result, their labor is precarious and invisible. Adapting the idea of ghostwriting, this paper articulates the concept of ghostuber to refer to these creative workers. Drawing from interviews with Japanese content creators and participant observation in YouTube video production, the paper considers how market norms and legal regulations shape the experience of Japanese ghostubers. Ghostubers do not view their position as unfair. Rather, assuming an entrepreneurial view of the self and engaging in forms of hope labor, they accept their precarious status. Moreover, due to industry conventions, lack of legal awareness, and a romantic vision of authorship that frames influencers as unique owners of their content, ghostubers do not consider attribution a necessary right of creators.","[Barbetta, Tommaso] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Interdisciplinary Informat Studies, Tokyo, Japan",University of Tokyo,"Barbetta, T (corresponding author), Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Interdisciplinary Informat Studies, Tokyo, Japan.",bluephilia@gmail.com,,,,,,,56,0,0,2,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1944-2866,,,POLICY INTERNET,Policy Internet,SEP,2022,14,3,,,,,633,650,,10.1002/poi3.323,0,,44805,18,Communication; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication; Government & Law,4V0WE,,,,,44885,WOS:000855021300001,0

Platforms are multisided markets that facilitate value-creating exchanges among users, such as social media, e-commerce, software QJ;application downloads, search, email, and cloud services. Internet access and the purely digital nature of many of the products and services make digital platforms potentially global in scope. This means that the rules and restrictions governing the flow of capital and information services among national markets strongly influence the economic and social potential of digital platforms. The paper conducts a sequential analysis of the rise of barriers to the United States-China trade in ICT and digital platform markets from 2000 to 2021. We find that China's thriving platform economy was relatively open, competitive and market-driven in its early stages, and benefited from U.S. capital and the entry of U.S. firms. Since 2009, both countries have progressively restricted access to each other's domestic information services markets. In both cases, the primary stated rationale involved national security claims rather than trade policy concerns. Drawing on International Political Economy theory, we label the United States-China interaction pattern digital neomercantilism. Digital neo-mercantilism fuses the power and security of the national state with economic development in the digital economy. Policymakers represent information flows and digital technologies in domestic policy discourse as critical to the security and relative power of the state, and pursue various forms of industrial policy, data localization, trade protectionism, or exclusion of foreigners as a result. Both the United States and China are following this policy.","[Mueller, Milton L.; Farhat, Karim] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Publ Policy, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology,"Mueller, ML (corresponding author), Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Publ Policy, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",milton@GATECH.EDU,,,,,,,52,1,1,18,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1944-2866,,,POLICY INTERNET,Policy Internet,JUN,2022,14,2,,,SI,,348,367,,10.1002/poi3.305,0,,44682,20,Communication; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication; Government & Law,2H3NL,,,,,44885,WOS:000798852700001,0

Hang's livestreams would humiliate celebrities, include personal attacks, criticize media and charity organizations, and use harassing language, resulting in the Vietnamese government regulating social media influencers. Vietnam is a centralized government that promotes the regulation of social media influencers to control the population by censoring content and banning certain discussion topics. This is exemplary of Vietnam's media regulatory environment: Vietnam wants to take advantage of the opportunities that new media and technology bring to promote economic integration, yet the Vietnamese government prefers to accept them by enforcing their adherence to local regulations via regulatory and economic measures. As a result, the Vietnamese government has increased control over livestreaming influencers: any social media account with more than 10,000 followers must provide account holders' contact information to government authorities. Further, social media platforms will be asked to remove content that has been flagged as problematic by government officials, shoring up Vietnam's view on regulation toward foreign social media platforms. These regulations allow the government to control the narrative around social issues and prevent dissenting voices from being heard. Departing from the analysis of Hang's case study, this article examines the current regulatory status of social media users with a specific focus on Vietnamese influencers.

JKM's structural power is not monolithic in the name of the Party State but supports a process of structuration that operates across multiple actors, administrative bodies and, governing layers. JKM has centralised data systems through the building of a nationwide algorithmic standard of COVID-19 governance. JKM typified the political dynamics of deterritorialisation, a reference to the state's governing mindset of eradicating local variants of policy implementation and governing autonomy in China. The removal of local power in pandemic administration has led to the production of a unified national subject.

This article seeks to add a new layer to the analysis of this conflict over state sovereignty and the global digital order. It draws on network theory as an alternative analytical lens to study the reconfiguration of power relations that define the Internet as a technical, social and economic network, and its governance. We review key conflicts and developments that shaped the Internet's history, from the Internet exceptionalists' visions in the 1990s to states' recent pursuits of digital sovereignty and trace how states, as well as private companies, seek to fundamentally reconfigure the dominant logic of the Internet and its sub-networks to expand and institutionalise their power position. We thus highlight a deeper layer of conflict: the current struggles over the technopolitical configuration of the Internet are not only influenced by the conflict between liberal and authoritarian visions of the Internet; they are also the result of continuous tensions between processes of centralisation and decentralisation of the Internet's technical foundations and its governance. As an effect of these dynamics, we currently witness a pluralisation of power while, at the same time, new points of centralised control emerge.","[Pohle, Julia] WZB Berlin Social Sci Ctr, Res Grp Polit Digitalizat, Reichpietschufer 50, D-10785 Berlin, Germany; [Voelsen, Daniel] German Inst Int & Secur Affairs, Global Issues Res Div, Berlin, Germany",,"Pohle, J (corresponding author), WZB Berlin Social Sci Ctr, Res Grp Polit Digitalizat, Reichpietschufer 50, D-10785 Berlin, Germany.",julia.pohle@wzb.eu,,"Voelsen, Daniel/0000-0001-9270-4125; Pohle, Julia/0000-0002-9442-4626",Projekt DEAL,Projekt DEAL,Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.,,70,0,0,8,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1944-2866,,,POLICY INTERNET,Policy Internet,MAR,2022,14,1,,,,,13,27,,10.1002/poi3.296,0,,44621,15,Communication; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication; Government & Law,0E1TI,,Green Published,,,44885,WOS:000771001900001,0

While research has highlighted the Chinese public's high approval and backing of SCSs, their engagement with these digital projects has not been fully explored. Based on 44 semi-structured interviews, our research examines Chinese citizens' digital participation in government-run SCSs at the local level. Our findings suggest that, despite perceiving SCSs as accepting and positive, most interviewees do not actively engage with local government-run SCSs. Multiple factors can explain the gap between the high acceptance and low participation rates, including a lack of awareness regarding local SCSs, a perception that registering and maintaining a decent credit score requires major effort, various concerns involving data privacy and safety, algorithm accuracy and fairness, potential risks, unappealing benefits offered by SCSs, and the voluntary aspect of participating in local SCSs. Our research adds to the existing literature on digital governance in authoritarian contexts by explaining why Chinese citizens do not necessarily engage with state-promoted digital projects.","[Li, Haili; Kostka, Genia] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Chinese Studies, Berlin, Germany",Free University of Berlin,"Kostka, G (corresponding author), Free Univ Berlin, Inst Chinese Studies, Berlin, Germany.",g.kostka@fu-berlin.de,,"Li, Haili/0000-0002-8487-7170",ERC Starting Grant [852169],ERC Starting Grant(European Research Council (ERC)),"ERC Starting Grant, Grant/Award Number: 852169",,41,0,0,5,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1944-2866,,,POLICY INTERNET,Policy Internet,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1002/poi3.316,0,,44805,30,Communication; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication; Government & Law,4I3RZ,,hybrid,,,44885,WOS:000850497200001,0

Through a survey of 481 college students in China, this study examined the relationships between censorship exposure, emotions, and information behaviors on sensitive issues online. The result shows that more exposure, though with a modest effect, predicts higher levels of anger and acquisition and production of information on censored topics. Anger itself is also a predictor of higher information acquisition and production, while fear is only negatively related to information production.

This holds true particularly for the scientific community, where evidence-informed policymaking can influence the effectiveness of public responses. In this context, understanding how to reach policymakers effectively and which policymakers are likely to engage with scientific information delivered through digital mediums is critical. This study provides a novel observational approach to understanding reach with policymakers through science email campaigns. Using a sample of nearly 3000 state policymakers, we assessed data from five digital messaging campaigns. Results indicate four profiles of legislators: those who rarely open and open slowly (Never Openers), those who only opened a couple of emails (Rare Openers), those who open quickly, but do not always open (Intermittent Openers), and those that consistently open quickly (Always Openers). Female legislators and legislators who had served for fewer terms were more likely to be Always Openers or Intermittent Openers, relative to male legislators and legislators who had served more terms. This study reveals patterns of email engagement and indicates science communication efforts may need to adopt more targeted strategies that better reach policymakers who tend to engage less frequently with emailed research content.","[Pugel, Jessica; Long, Elizabeth C.; Giray, Cagla; Crowley, D.

By employing a collaboration of walkthrough and ethnographic methods, this article examines how Red's influencer governance, intersecting both HK and Mainland Chinese contexts, guides, trains, and controls influencers and users to become relevant to the practices of entrepreneurial citizenship, and how influencers and their followers act through, rely on and negotiate with the governmental practices and authoritative discourses. These practices and discourses motivate influencers to not only transform themselves into entrepreneurial citizen subjects who could produce individualizing knowledge about self-care and self-governance as techniques of disciplining the community, but also expand the key governmental strategies of reconstructing an entrepreneurial identity with their followers on behalf of the government. Although Red is not a mainstream influencer platform in HK, the governmentality over and through influencers on Red provides fruitful cases that demonstrate how HK's model of influencer governance is based on the bottom-up networks through little ways in which management, guidance, and control occur with the active engagement of individual citizens, social organizations, professional associations, and businesses to meet the desired goals of the central and HKSAR government.","[Ju, Ran] Univ Illinois, Inst Commun Res, Champaign, IL 61820 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Ju, R (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Inst Commun Res, Champaign, IL 61820 USA.",ranju3@illinois.edu,,"Ju, Ran/0000-0001-6388-5211",,,,,76,0,0,5,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1944-2866,,,POLICY INTERNET,Policy Internet,SEP,2022,14,3,,,,,618,632,,10.1002/poi3.324,0,,44805,15,Communication; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication; Government & Law,4V0WE,,hybrid,,,44885,WOS:000855030900001,0

This article examines how policymakers grapple with the problem by looking at a growing number of expert inquiries on digital platforms-a proxy for the international policy debate-that focus on policy problems ranging from market dominance and privacy risks to the spread of disinformation. Specifically, the article develops a schema of related policy silos and tradeoffs that arise in these debates: (1) policy area silos, (2) market/sectoral silos, (3) temporal silos, and (4) normative tradeoffs. Then, it critically examines the implications of these silos and tradeoffs for policy interventions aimed at addressing concerns related to datafication and platformization, raising key questions about the scope of and assumptions underlying platform regulation internationally and noting the way they constrain policy design and thwart more holistic policy solutions.","[Popiel, Pawel] Univ Penn, Annenberg Sch Commun, 3620 Walnut St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania,"Popiel, P (corresponding author), Univ Penn, Annenberg Sch Commun, 3620 Walnut St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",ppopiel@asc.upenn.edu,,"Popiel, Pawel/0000-0001-5641-581X",,,,,93,0,0,6,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1944-2866,,,POLICY INTERNET,Policy Internet,MAR,2022,14,1,,,,,28,46,,10.1002/poi3.283,0,,44621,19,Communication; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication; Government & Law,0E1TI,,,,,44885,WOS:000772891500001,0

We deploy the concept of networked political brokerage to examine the sociotechnical relations among influencers, the platform, and its users, and how this dynamic assemblage engages in the intermediation of anti-media populism. The study draws from a critical examination of the network and discursive tactics deployed by Filipino YouTube influencers who advance partisan political commentary and deceptive narratives to delegitimize mainstream media institutions through issue network analysis concerning the franchise denial and eventual shutdown of the Philippines' oldest media network, ABS-CBN. We problematize how influencers engage platform affordances and cultures of use to enable, amplify, and fortify the brokering of their political agenda within a larger network of political actors, while eliding accountability. Through the mutually affirming relationship of content creators and the platform, networked hyperpoliticized contents gain visibility and galvanize anti-media rhetoric.

Presenting new interview data examining the experiences and perceptions of regulators, policy makers, civil servants, civil society groups and academics in the United Kingdom, we distil three barriers: political reticence, logistical challenges and conflicting policy proposals.

The furore surrounding the introduction of the legislation, and Facebook's subsequent Australian 'news ban' exposed the limits of a regulatory model that has previously left the tech industry to moderate itself. In this paper, we argue the introduction of the Code is a leading example of a global trajectory towards regulatory change, which sees governments move from a reactive regulation model to specific interventions around the governance of digital media spaces. We discuss how best to measure the successes and failures around this more interventionist model through a case study of the implementation of the Code in Australia. More broadly we consider how global platforms have responded, and whether the reform is an effective regulatory model for other national governments to emulate.","[Bossio, Diana; Barnet, Belinda] Swinburne Univ, Sch Social Sci Media Film & Educ, H31,POB 218, Hawthorn, Vic 3122, Australia; [Flew, Terry] Univ Sydney, Fac Arts & Social Sci, Camperdown, NSW, Australia; [Meese, James] RMIT Univ, Coll Design & Social Context, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Leaver, Tama] Curtin Univ, Sch Media Creat Arts & Social Inquiry, Perth, WA, Australia",Swinburne University of Technology; University of Sydney; Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT); Curtin University,"Bossio, D (corresponding author), Swinburne Univ, Sch Social Sci Media Film & Educ, H31,POB 218, Hawthorn, Vic 3122, Australia.",dbossio@swin.edu.au,"Leaver, Tama/K-2697-2014","Leaver, Tama/0000-0002-4065-4725; Barnet, Belinda/0000-0002-7045-6084; Flew, Terry/0000-0003-4485-9338; Meese, James/0000-0003-1910-6166; Bossio, Diana/0000-0002-5019-7118",,,,,73,1,1,6,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1944-2866,,,POLICY INTERNET,Policy Internet,MAR,2022,14,1,,,,,136,150,,10.1002/poi3.284,0,,44593,15,Communication; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication; Government & Law,0E1TI,,"hybrid, Green Published",,,44885,WOS:000760063600001,0

An adapted version of the United Nations e-Government maturity model was used to assess the portals of the 50 largest municipalities of Greece. The factors influencing the e-Government maturity development are examined through ordinal regression. The findings suggest that e-Government maturity models have limited ability to capture the e-Government development as it may not be considered linear. Municipal authorities have taken steps towards e-Government, however, they are missing functionalities that are at the core of digital transformation.

In recent years, a policy debate has emerged over the dangers posed to the process by fake comments that impersonate ordinary citizens. This paper helps to clarify the terms of this debate by evaluating a contentious and prominent case in the United States, the nearly 24 million comments from the Federal Communications Commission's 2017 Restoring Internet Freedom proceeding. Using a two-step methodology that combines a computationally efficient search algorithm and a neural network language model, I show that regulators were able to cite much of the relevant information submitted in public comments by relying on longstanding methods of information gathering through interest groups, despite the fact that fake comments outnumbered others 3 to 1. The results suggest that fake comments did not impede regulators' ability to extract specialized information from the public consultation process, but may have distorted signals from mass comment campaigns about constituent mobilization.","[Handan-Nader, Cassandra] Stanford Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Encina Hall West Room 100, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University,"Handan-Nader, C (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Encina Hall West Room 100, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",slnader@stanford.edu,,,,,,,30,0,0,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1944-2866,,,POLICY INTERNET,Policy Internet,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1002/poi3.327,0,,44835,17,Communication; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication; Government & Law,5Q3MX,,,,,44885,WOS:000873741000001,0

The two largest economies display strikingly divergent regulatory approaches to cryptocurrencies and Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). China completely banned cryptocurrencies but became a front-runner in developing a CBDC. It aims to expand the RMB's global role without giving up its monetary control. U.S. administrations have instead reluctantly considered regulating cryptocurrencies. Discussions on a potential digital U.S. dollar (USD) only began in 2020. Washington aims at preserving the existing cross-border financial mechanisms and offshore infrastructure for USD-denominated transactions and credit creation. It focuses on financial crime and maintaining the innovation dynamic of its private sector to preserve its exorbitant privilege. Emerging financial infrastructures and standards for digital currencies are the new technological arena for U.S.-China monetary competition.","[Huang, Ying] Chinese Acad Social Sci, Inst European Studies, 5 Jianguomennei St, Beijing 100732, Peoples R China; [Huang, Ying; Mayer, Maximilian] Univ Bonn, Ctr Adv Secur Strateg & Integrat Studies, Bonn, Germany",Chinese Academy of Social Sciences; University of Bonn,"Huang, Y (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Social Sci, Inst European Studies, 5 Jianguomennei St, Beijing 100732, Peoples R China.",yinghuang@cass.org.cn,,"Mayer, Maximilian/0000-0002-1857-1413; Huang, Ying/0000-0002-7514-5613",Ministry of Culture and Science of the State of North RhineWestphalia:; Postdoctoral Innovation Program of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences,Ministry of Culture and Science of the State of North RhineWestphalia:; Postdoctoral Innovation Program of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences,Return Program of the Ministry of Culture and Science of the State of North RhineWestphalia: research group Infrastructures of China's Modernity and Their Global Constitutive Effects; Postdoctoral Innovation Program of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences,,189,4,4,10,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1944-2866,,,POLICY INTERNET,Policy Internet,JUN,2022,14,2,,,SI,,324,347,,10.1002/poi3.302,0,,44713,24,Communication; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication; Government & Law,2H3NL,,hybrid,,,44885,WOS:000806162300001,0

However, the worldwide popularity of TikTok requires the platform to constantly negotiate with the rules, norms and regulatory frameworks of the regions where it operates. Failure to do so has had significant consequences. For example, for content-related reasons, the platform has been (temporarily and permanently) banned in several countries, including India, Indonesia and Pakistan. Moreover, its Chinese ownership and popularity among underage users have made the platform subject to heightened scrutiny and criticism. In this paper, we introduce the notion of visibility moderation, defined as the process through which digital platforms manipulate the reach of user-generated content through algorithmic or regulatory means. We discuss particular measures TikTok implements to shape visibility and issues arising from it. This paper presents findings from interviews with content creators, which takes a user-centric approach to understand their sense-making of and negotiation with TikTok's visibility moderation. Findings from this study also highlight concerns that leave these stakeholders feeling confused, frustrated or powerless, which offer important directions for further research.","[Zeng, Jing] Univ Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; [Kaye, D.

Our results illustrate that the SCSs are envisioned and designed as social quantification practices including two facets: a normative apparatus encouraging good citizens and social morality, and a regulative apparatus disciplining deviant behaviors and enforcing social management. We argue that the SCSs illustrate the significant shift in which state actors increasingly become data processors whereas citizens are reconfigured as datafied subjects that can be measured, compared, and governed.

Although platforms have recently developed more explicit policies in regard to what constitutes hate speech and harmful content, it appears that platforms often use subjective judgments of harm that specifically pertains to spectacular, physical violence-but harm takes on many shapes and complex forms. The politics of defining harm and violence within these platforms are complex and dynamic, and represent entrenched histories of how control over these definitions extends to people's perceptions of them. Via a critical discourse analysis of policy documents from three major platforms (Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube), we argue that platforms' narrow definitions of harm and violence are not just insufficient but result in these platforms engaging in a form of symbolic violence. Moreover, the platforms position harm as a floating signifier, imposing conceptions of not just what violence is and how it manifests, but who it impacts. Rather than changing the mechanisms of their design that enable harm, the platforms reconfigure intentionality and causality to try to stop users from being harmful, which, ironically, perpetuates harm. We provide a number of suggestions, namely a restorative justice-focused approach, in addressing platform harm.","[DeCook, Julia R.; Foyle, Kali] Loyola Univ Chicago, Sch Commun, 51 E Pearson St, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Cotter, Kelley] Penn State Univ, Coll Informat Sci & Technol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Kanthawala, Shaheen] Univ Alabama, Dept Journalism & Creat Media, Tuscaloosa, AL USA",Loyola University Chicago; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa,"DeCook, JR (corresponding author), Loyola Univ Chicago, Sch Commun, 51 E Pearson St, Chicago, IL 60611 USA.",jdecook@luc.edu,,"Kanthawala, Shaheen/0000-0001-9321-0266",,,,,74,0,0,4,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1944-2866,,,POLICY INTERNET,Policy Internet,MAR,2022,14,1,,,,,63,78,,10.1002/poi3.290,0,,44621,16,Communication; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication; Government & Law,0E1TI,,,,,44885,WOS:000768213100001,0

Along with new opportunities for city residents, globally operating platforms such as Airbnb and Uber also raised specific challenges, sparking calls for adequate responses by city governments around the world. The aim of this paper is to explain the diversity of regulations across cities. Holding constant national factors, we conducted comparative case studies in six Swiss cities (Zurich, Geneva, Davos, Montreux, Aarau, and Neuchatel) to investigate political processes leading to local regulations of Airbnb and Uber. Four crucial factors shape regulatory trajectories. First, intensity of platform-related issues in cities is key in shaping the stringency of regulatory responses. Second, grassroots and political mobilization plays a role: where these issues become politically salient, regulations are stricter. Third, the inscription of platform-related issues on a city's institutional agenda tends to produce stricter regulatory responses. Finally, local governments tend to adopt a stricter control over platforms in cities where relevant urban sectors are already highly regulated. We conclude that the varying stringency of governmental responses to the platform economy lays in the dynamics of politicization from which they emerged.","[Benli-Trichet, Marine C.; Kuebler, Daniel] Univ Zurich, Ctr Democracy Studies, Dept Polit Sci, Kuttigerstr 51, CH-5000 Aarau, Switzerland",FHNW University of Applied Sciences & Arts Northwestern Switzerland; University of Zurich,"Benli-Trichet, MC (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Ctr Democracy Studies, Dept Polit Sci, Kuttigerstr 51, CH-5000 Aarau, Switzerland.",marinecharlotte.trichet@zda.uzh.ch,,"Kubler, Daniel/0000-0001-7373-0926",Universitat Zurich,Universitat Zurich,"The authors would like to thank Lyne Schuppisser for valuable research assistance in data collection, as well as express their gratitude to the two anonymous reviewers for thorough and constructive comments.

There is already an abundance of literature written about the governance of platforms pertaining to each country respectively. Despite this, a dual-track accounting of the governance of platforms in the United States and China in tandem is still lacking. This paper argues that with the historic turbulence of the United States-China relationship and the escalating challenges that governance activities have encountered, the governance of platforms of these two countries are actually more similar than they seem, and have been moving towards a middle ground, characterized by multiple governance subjects, more pragmatic and balanced goals, as well as a full range and tit-for-tat governance measures. To prove this trend, this paper uses documentary research and a comparative approach to analyze changes in the subjects, objectives and means of governance of platforms for the United States and China. Following that, this paper explains the motivation behind the trend towards the middle ground governance of platforms in the context of United States-China relations.","[Cai, Cuihong] Fudan Univ, Ctr Amer Studies, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Wang, Tianchan] Fudan Univ, Sch Int Relat & Publ Affairs, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Fudan University; Fudan University,"Cai, CH (corresponding author), Fudan Univ, Ctr Amer Studies, Int Relat, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",chcai@fudan.edu.cn,,"Cai, Cuihong/0000-0001-8221-0244",,,,,64,2,2,11,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1944-2866,,,POLICY INTERNET,Policy Internet,JUN,2022,14,2,,,SI,,243,262,,10.1002/poi3.303,0,,44682,20,Communication; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication; Government & Law,2H3NL,,,,,44885,WOS:000798852900001,0

This paper argues for an alternative solution: an effects-based analysis methodology for regulating platforms which are not proven to be dominant. Based on case studies including the Alibaba decision, JD.com case, Meituan case, and Visa case, it follows that we should stay focused on foreclosure effects while specifying the type of conduct that calls for careful scrutiny. But it is controversial to apply the traditional leverage theory and essential facilities doctrine to digital markets, which are of great significance to the determination of foreclosure effects. This paper introduces a related markets hypothesis to illustrate the leverage of market power, and applies a modified costs-based test to determine whether the data resources held by the platform constitute a bottleneck. This paper finally proposes a classification scheme different from the criteria on a basis of company size. The decisive factors for classification include: form of platform enterprises, behavioral pattern, nature of market, market structure, and the competitive environment in related markets.","[He, Qing] Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Fac Law, Sch Humanities, 10 Xitucheng Rd, Beijing 100876, Peoples R China",Beijing University of Posts & Telecommunications,"He, Q (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Fac Law, Sch Humanities, 10 Xitucheng Rd, Beijing 100876, Peoples R China.",heqingntpu@bupt.edu.cn,,"He, Qing/0000-0003-4112-1194",,,,,35,1,1,16,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1944-2866,,,POLICY INTERNET,Policy Internet,JUN,2022,14,2,,,SI,,284,303,,10.1002/poi3.304,0,,44682,20,Communication; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication; Government & Law,2H3NL,,,,,44885,WOS:000798852800001,0

While much of the discourse has focused on the implementation of these frameworks through top-down, centrally administered institutions, little discussion has turned to the role of platform regulation from the bottom up-that is, the ability of individuals to affect corporate behavior through the courts as litigants. This paper attempts to address that gap by offering a comparative analysis of the role of data protection litigation in both the United States and China as one institutional mechanism through which governments may pursue their larger regulatory goals. Privacy and data protection laws in both countries grant individuals enforceable rights against other private and public actors. While litigants in the United States and China face barriers to affect corporate behavior, they do so for notable dissimilar reasons due to the unique and historical differences of the legal systems in both countries.

In this study, we examined the emotional discourse before and following a ban of graphic images of self-harm on Facebook and Instagram. This observational case series study assesses a corpus of 8,013 tweets that specifically mention Facebook and/or Instagram between June 1, 2018, and May 31, 2019 (the ban occurred on February 7, 2019). Topical content was elucidated via statistical modeling to extract abstract topics in discourse. The graphic self-harm ban produced emotional shifts in users of social media. A time series plot produced peaks of tweets on the banning of graphic images of self-harm including political events, news coverage, and media exemplars of suicide (both celebrity and noncelebrity). We observed raw proportional differences with elevated emotions before the ban (i.e., disgust, joy, surprise, and trust) followed by elevated emotions occurring after the ban (i.e., anger, anticipation, and sadness). This study provides insight into how the policy-change relating to self-harm was received by those with a vested interest. These insights can be valuable to policymakers and advocates for those affected by self-harm.","[Smith, Hayden] Univ South Carolina Syst, Dept Criminol & Criminal Justice, 1305 Greene St, Columbia, SC 29208 USA; [Cipolli, William] Colgate Univ, Dept Math, Hamilton, NY 13346 USA",Colgate University,"Smith, H (corresponding author), Univ South Carolina Syst, Dept Criminol & Criminal Justice, 1305 Greene St, Columbia, SC 29208 USA.",smithhp@mailbox.sc.edu,,"Cipolli, William/0000-0003-4236-5254",,,,,70,3,3,11,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1944-2866,,,POLICY INTERNET,Policy Internet,MAR,2022,14,1,,,,,170,185,,10.1002/poi3.272,0,,44470,16,Communication; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication; Government & Law,0E1TI,,,,,44885,WOS:000712272300001,0

However, the composition of these segments can vary greatly, inherently resulting in different base rate percentages about the same health issue (e.g. '51.9% of all COVID 19-related deaths in the U.S. occurred among Caucasians' vs. '16.6% of all COVID 19-related deaths in the U.S. occurred among Hispanics') that can potentially lead to different responses from consumers. Therefore, this research examines how individuals process, and respond to, manipulated base rates. Study 1 demonstrates that higher (vs. lower) base rates increase individuals' healthy behavioural intentions by elevating their risk perceptions. Study 2 uncovers a more complex serial process underlying the impact of base rates on intentions to follow recommended behaviours in health messages. Importantly, we demonstrate a critical effect reversal such that higher base rates have an unintended negative impact on individuals' compliance intentions when involvement is lower (vs. higher).

This trust makes the use of influencer marketing a powerful tool for advertisers. With increasing consumer interest, the sustainable fashion industry has grown and social media influencers are being leveraged to shift consumer perspective and purchasing behavior. Using semi-structured interviews, this research addresses the use of influencers as an advertising tactic in the sustainable fashion industry to analyze the social media practices and monetization strategies of sustainable fashion social media influencers. The term 'sustainable fashion social media influencers' is introduced to describe influential content creators who discuss sustainable fashion on social media. Importantly, the research identifies 'content creation calibration', which refers to the practice of social media influencers calibrating their content to account for their ethics and desire for compensation. The research highlights the future challenges for advertisers and influencers when linking sustainability to entrepreneurship in influencer marketing.","[Jacobson, Jenna; Harrison, Brooke] Ryerson Univ, Ted Rogers Sch Management, 350 Victoria St, Toronto, ON M5B 2K3, Canada",Toronto Metropolitan University,"Jacobson, J (corresponding author), Ryerson Univ, Ted Rogers Sch Management, 350 Victoria St, Toronto, ON M5B 2K3, Canada.",jenna.jacobson@ryerson.ca,,"Jacobson, Jenna/0000-0002-1371-1077","Ted Rogers School of Management, Ryerson University (TRSM Research Advancement Grant)","Ted Rogers School of Management, Ryerson University (TRSM Research Advancement Grant)","The research was supported by the Ted Rogers School of Management, Ryerson University (TRSM Research Advancement Grant).",,121,2,2,71,152,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0265-0487,1759-3948,,INT J ADVERT,Int.

A potential solution is to launch new retail formats that allow luxury shoppers to blur physical and digital (phygital) channels through mobile devices. Luxury shoppers, then, can use their newfound powers to fantasize and indulge in store atmospheres through mobile-mediated activities. To that end, this article investigates whether self-gifting, a hedonic shopper behaviour, can drive the acceptance of phygital shopping experiences alongside status-seeking and fashion opinion leadership (OL). To test this prospect, the research design employs an industry consultation and an empirical study. In Study 1, design thinking is leveraged to develop and pre-screen realistic interaction intentions on technology executives in the apparel industry (N = 50). This consultation yields nine interaction intentions that enable shoppers to build communities, break the rules, and alter the division of labour within retail stores. Then, Study 2 involves collecting online survey data from a luxury panel (N = 321) to test a structural equation model. The results show that status-seeking and fashion OL are positively associated with interaction intentions towards phygital shopping experiences. Meanwhile, self-gifting is a generative mechanism for interaction intentions, which mediates fashion OL and partially mediates status-seeking. Therefore, hedonic experiences such as self-gifting and the support of fashion influencers are critical to advance luxury shoppers towards accepting phygital shopping experiences. Yet, status-seeking is needed to a lesser but still important degree to maintain exclusivity in luxury stores.","[Lawry, Charles Aaron] Purdue Univ, Div Consumer Sci, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus,"Lawry, CA (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Consumer Sci, 812 West State St, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",clawry@purdue.edu,,"Lawry, Charles/0000-0002-4349-3955","Salesforce Commerce Cloud (nee Demandware); Terry J.

In comparison with adults, children (up to 12 years old) are thought to be more vulnerable when confronted with advertising and, consequently, more sensitive to its impact. The rationale behind this common assumption is that advertising literacy has not fully developed in children, and that they are therefore less capable of recognizing the temptations of advertising and evaluate it in a critical manner. In this article, we discuss how the topic of children as vulnerable consumers has been addressed in advertising research over the past four decades (since the 1980s), particularly in the International Journal of Advertising (IJA). Specifically, we discuss the state of research on the unintended effects of advertising and children's advertising literacy and defences. Finally, we propose a research agenda including upcoming trends that need to be addressed in future research on children's vulnerability to advertising.","[Rozendaal, Esther; Buijzen, Moniek] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Social & Behav Sci, Burgemeester Oudlaan 50, NL-3062 PA Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Buijzen, Moniek] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Behav Sci Inst, Nijmegen, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Radboud University Nijmegen,"Rozendaal, E (corresponding author), Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Social & Behav Sci, Burgemeester Oudlaan 50, NL-3062 PA Rotterdam, Netherlands.",Rozendaal@essb.eur.nl,,,,,,,32,0,0,2,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0265-0487,1759-3948,,INT J ADVERT,Int.

Drawing on regulatory focus and information processing theories, we tested the moderating role of the regulatory focus of ad messages on the persuasiveness of their metaphors. In Experiment 1, we found that promotion-focused (vs. prevention-focused) verbal messages in ads were more favorable when messages were metaphoric (vs. literal), whereas prevention-focused (vs. promotion-focused) messages were more favored in literal (vs. metaphoric) claims. Experiment 2 further demonstrated that processing fluency functions as a mediating factor that elucidates the relationship found in Experiment 1. Experiment 2 also tested the generalizability of the Experiment 1 findings by varying the degree of artful deviation in the metaphoric claims. The results across both experiments suggest that when metaphoric claims highlight an approach to a desired outcome (i.e. promotion focus), the persuasiveness of metaphors in ads is enhanced, while when the avoidance of an undesired outcome (i.e. prevention focus) is emphasized, literal claims rather than metaphoric claims are more persuasive.","[Ahn, Hongmin] Dongguk Univ Seoul, Dept Advertising & Publ Relat, Seoul, South Korea; [Yim, Mark Yi-Cheon] Univ Massachusetts Lowell, Robert J Manning Sch Business, Dept Mkt Entrepreneurship & Innovat, Lowell, MA USA; [Sung, Yongjun] Korea Univ, Sch Psychol, 145 Anam Ro, Seoul 136701, South Korea",Dongguk University; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Lowell; Korea University,"Sung, Y (corresponding author), Korea Univ, Sch Psychol, 145 Anam Ro, Seoul 136701, South Korea.",sungyj@korea.ac.kr,,"Yim, Mark Yi-Cheon/0000-0003-1341-8687; Ahn, Hongmin/0000-0002-8253-9776",,,,,58,2,2,8,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0265-0487,1759-3948,,INT J ADVERT,Int.

Nevertheless, research on the effectiveness of user-generated content, and selfie campaigns in particular, is still scarce. In the context of selfie campaigns, participation (i.e. taking a selfie with the brand and posting it) represents one form of consumer engagement. Besides a behavioral reaction, selfie campaigns might also stimulate brand interest. To fill this research gap, the current research relates the mental-imagery-evoking potential of selfie campaigns to participation and brand interest, with both variables being assumed to mediate the impact of mental imagery on brand attitude. Findings yielded by one qualitative pilot study, one field study and an online survey confirm our theoretical reasoning that selfie campaigns prompt mental imagery, and that brand interest (but not selfie-campaign participation) influences brand attitude.","[Wolfsteiner, Elisabeth] Univ Appl Sci Wiener Neustadt, Dept Innovat, Zeiselgraben 4, A-3250 Wieselburg, Austria; [Garaus, Marion; Wagner, Udo] Modul Univ Vienna, Dept Int Management, Vienna, Austria; [Girschick, Alexander] Univ Vienna, Dept Mkt & Int Business, Vienna, Austria",University of Vienna,"Wolfsteiner, E (corresponding author), Univ Appl Sci Wiener Neustadt, Dept Innovat, Zeiselgraben 4, A-3250 Wieselburg, Austria.",elisabeth.wolfsteiner@fhwn.ac.at,,,University of Vienna,University of Vienna,The first author acknowledges financial support for this research by a Small Research Grant from the University of Vienna.,,86,0,0,15,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0265-0487,1759-3948,,INT J ADVERT,Int.

Extending the literature in this area, the present research explores how consumers with high (vs. low) levels of moral identity react more negatively to a humorous advertisement. Further, this effect is driven by the emotion of disgust elicited by the humorous content. These predictions are tested across three studies. As such, the findings of this research offer theoretical and practical implications by highlighting the potentially negative role of moral identity in consumer evaluations of humorous advertisements.","[Paramita, Widya] Gadjah Mada Univ, Fac Econ & Business, Yogyakarta, Indonesia; [Septianto, Felix] Univ Queensland, Sch Business, 39 Blair Dr, St Lucia, Qld 4067, Australia; [Nasution, Reza Ashari] Bandung Inst Technol, Sch Business & Management, Bandung, Indonesia",Gadjah Mada University; University of Queensland; Institute Technology of Bandung,"Septianto, F (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Business, 39 Blair Dr, St Lucia, Qld 4067, Australia.",f.septianto@uq.edu.au,"Septianto, Felix/I-7694-2019","Septianto, Felix/0000-0002-7487-761X; Paramita, Widya/0000-0002-8432-1586",,,,,59,0,0,10,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0265-0487,1759-3948,,INT J ADVERT,Int.

This three-part study examined the identification of a boundary condition in message type effects and the underlying mechanisms of such effects in social network sites (SNS). The findings of Experiment 1 indicate that when exposed to a product-focussed visual, PIOC messages yield more positive CRM outcomes (vs. PSC messages). However, when subjects were exposed to a cause-focussed visual, there were no differences in CRM outcomes between PIOC and PSC messages. Experiment 2 and Experiment 3 investigated the underlying mechanism via serial mediation analyses. The findings show that positive CRM outcomes derived from PIOC messages (vs. PSC messages) arose mainly through consumers' perception of CRM. Conversely, when exposed to the cause-focussed visual, consumers' perception of CRM was not influenced by the message type. The current study contributes to the existing CRM literature by applying consumer attributions of a company's motive in CRM messages.

The different ethnic environments of consumers in Studies 1 A and 1B and consumers' individual differences in other-group orientation in Study 2 moderate the way inclusive products are evaluated and responded to. Additionally, a serial mediation analysis reveals that the inclusivity of products increases perceptions of brand inclusiveness and altruistic motives, thereby contributing to favorable attitudes and behavioral intentions.

We conducted three experiments to examine the differential effects of illustrations and photographs on customers' willingness to try a meat product and ascertain whether this relationship was mediated by perceived luxuriousness. Participants reported a greater willingness to try a novel product, such as clean meat, when the advertisement featured an illustration (vs. a photograph), demonstrating the art infusion effect. However, there were non-significant differences among participants in terms of their willingness to try a familiar product, such as conventional meat. The indirect effect of illustration on willingness to try clean mean via perceived luxuriousness was stronger compared to the conventional meat condition. This mediation effect of luxuriousness was also validated using the moderation-of-process approach.

While many discussions of AI centre on algorithms and models, we argue that to understand AI in Marcom, one must consider the broader ecosystem in which these algorithms operate. This article develops a framework that shows the Marcom-AI ecosystem and its outcomes, consisting of the following mutually reinforcing components: (1) algorithms and models, (2) customer data (3) digital environments (e.g. mobile devices, digital signage), (4) digital content assets (e.g. images, videos, copy) and (5) information technology infrastructure. We briefly sketch the uses of AI within Marcom. Most or all components of the ecosystem are usually necessary for AI to address Marcom opportunities and challenges. In conjunction with these components, the ecosystem comprises a broad set of stakeholders: consumers, influencers, brands/advertisers, media and messaging platforms, data platforms, publishers and content creators, MarTech/AdTech vendors, AI/ML service providers, device manufacturers and regulators. The combination of these components and stakeholders enables marketers to optimize touchpoints through targeting and choice architectures, create platforms for testing, derive insights from data, and support marketing processes and workflows. Building from the framework, we close by identifying future research directions for advertising scholars, including understanding consumer response to AI touchpoints, privacy, interactions between stakeholders, and how the ecosystem will evolve.","[Malthouse, Edward; Copulsky, Jonathan] Northwestern Univ, Medill Spiegel Res Ctr, Integrated Mkt Commun, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Northwestern University,"Malthouse, E (corresponding author), Northwestern Univ, Medill Spiegel Res Ctr, Integrated Mkt Commun, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",ecm@northwestern.edu,,,,,,,52,1,1,21,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0265-0487,1759-3948,,INT J ADVERT,Int.

Using a data set collected from Amazon, we find that the differential effects exist, but are moderated by the dimensions of review characteristics: the numerical review characteristics (i.e. review volume, review rating, and rating variation) have larger effects on imitators than on innovators, but the review textual characteristics (i.e. review emotional content) show the opposite effects.

To fill the gap, this study tested how crisis type and ad identification influence the effectiveness of native CSR advertising as a post-crisis response strategy. An online experiment was conducted using a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults. The results indicated that perceived manipulativeness was the underlying mechanism of how ad identification impaired consumer responses. Crisis type affected advertising effectiveness through consumers' attributions of crisis responsibility and values-driven CSR motive. More importantly, ad identification significantly impaired consumers' attitudes toward a native CSR advertisement and their intention to share the advertisement in the victim crisis condition, but not in the accidental or intentional crisis condition. These findings provide meaningful contributions to both the research and practice of CSR advertising.","[Wu, Linwan; Overton, Holly] Univ South Carolina, Coll Informat & Commun, Sch Journalism & Mass Commun, 800 Sumter St,Room 328, Columbia, SC 29208 USA",University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia,"Wu, LW (corresponding author), Univ South Carolina, Coll Informat & Commun, Sch Journalism & Mass Commun, 800 Sumter St,Room 328, Columbia, SC 29208 USA.",linwanwu@mailbox.sc.edu,,"Wu, Linwan/0000-0002-5294-3559; Overton, Holly/0000-0003-1980-8512",Page Legacy Scholar Grant [2018OC002]; Arthur W.

This paper investigates the motivation shift hypothesis, suggesting that people's prosocial behavior is consistent when asked to make subsequent donations; however, their prosocial motivation is inconsistent. To test this hypothesis, two charitable message appeals were used: a message that focuses on the benefits to others (i.e. altruistic other-benefit) and a message that focuses on the donors' benefits (i.e. egoistic self-benefit). In a pilot study and three experiments, this paper suggests that after agreeing to an altruistic charitable request, people are more generous if they see a self-benefit message appeal. We propose that consumers' moral status plays a role which increases egoistic motivation in subsequent charitable decisions, following an altruistic charitable giving. This pattern is only observed when the subsequent request is asked by a different charity, as opposed to the same charity.","[Fanggidae, Jappy P.] State Polytech Kupang, Business Adm Dept, Jln Adisucipto Penfui, Kota Kupang, Nusa Tenggara T, Indonesia; [Jin, Hyun Seung; Kelly, Louise] Queensland Univ Technol, Fac Business & Law, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Kim, Hyoje Jay] Univ Strathclyde, Strathclyde Business Sch, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland",Queensland University of Technology (QUT); University of Strathclyde,"Fanggidae, JP (corresponding author), State Polytech Kupang, Business Adm Dept, Jln Adisucipto Penfui, Kota Kupang, Nusa Tenggara T, Indonesia.",jappy.fanggidae@pnk.ac.id,,,,,,,66,0,0,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0265-0487,1759-3948,,INT J ADVERT,Int.

Many brands use social media to communicate their ideas and values with their consumers. Guided by the theories of cognitive behavioral, congruity, attribution, and social identity, this study provides an integrative framework that incorporates two brand factors (brand-sociopolitical cause fit and self-serving motive) and two social media factors (attitude and trust) to explain the process of how brand activism influences consumers' responses toward brands. Results show that brand-sociopolitical cause fit, self-serving motive, attitude toward brand activism in social media, and trust in social media are all antecedents that positively relate to the authenticity of brand activism in social media. Furthermore, brand activism authenticity is positively associated with electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) intention, which consequently enhances brand image, purchase intent, and brand loyalty.

To address this topic of interest, this study presents and tests an integrative theoretical framework for consumer-brand identification from both a social identity and consumer engagement perspective. It articulates the conditions under which consumers are likely to identify with a brand that communicates social purpose and how that identification process can be enhanced through empathy and self-involving gamification. Findings from two field experiments reveal that (1) value and attribute attractiveness of a brand have a positive impact on consumer-brand identification, and (2) in turn they will increase consumers' extra-role behavioural intention; and (3) engaging consumers using empathy and selfinvolving gamification enhance the identification process. The results were replicated and confirmed in an online and a laboratory experiment employing different brand contexts.

This study aims to gain insights into the level of persuasion knowledge of influencer marketing on Instagram, and which cues Instagram users use to identify influencer marketing. An eye tracking study (N = 67) and an online experiment (N = 371) reveal that (1) Instagram users seem to be aware of influencer marketing but also make mistakes in identifying it within their Instagram feed, (2) users pay most attention to brand tags in pictures and 'Paid partnership' labels and least attention to #ad, and (3) disclosures, brand presence, and influencer type all influence the level of conceptual persuasion knowledge. Although previous research has shown that disclosures can be important drivers of persuasion knowledge activation, this study is the first to reveal that bottom-up factors such as brand presence and the type of influencer can also have this effect. Importantly, our findings signal that the lines between non-commercial and commercial content on Instagram are still blurred.","[Boerman, Sophie C.; Muller, Celine M.] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Commun Res ASCoR, POB 15791, NL-1001 NG Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam,"Boerman, SC (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Commun Res ASCoR, POB 15791, NL-1001 NG Amsterdam, Netherlands.",s.c.boerman@uva.nl,,"Boerman, Sophie/0000-0002-2453-1493",Digital Communication Methods Lab of the University of Amsterdam [S218-19],Digital Communication Methods Lab of the University of Amsterdam,The eye tracking study was funded by a Thesis Funding Grant issued to Celine Muller by the Digital Communication Methods Lab of the University of Amsterdam (S218-19).,,54,11,11,42,87,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0265-0487,1759-3948,,INT J ADVERT,Int.

In this study, we also investigate the attitude toward IRAs and IRA value that influence the intention to use IRAs. AI powered recommendation agents have achieved noticeable outcomes in the contactless era by boosting revenues and customer value. On the Stitch Fix platform, an online personal styling service platform, AI-driven IRAs provide personalized recommendations to customers encompassing fashion styling and product design. In this study that considers the Stitch Fix context, a successful case of AI-driven IRAs, a survey was used to investigate key questions about the relationships among goals, IRA value, attitude, and intention to use AI-driven IRAs on the Stitch Fix platform. The participants were 321 AI-driven IRA users from South Korea recruited by a professional survey company. In conclusion, the study clarifies the relationship between personal hedonic goals and attitude and the value of IRAs, and the effects of these goals that ultimately influence the intention to use IRAs. The findings offer practical implications for IRAs that can be used to help consumers search and choose products. IRAs can be particularly helpful for engaging consumers with hedonic goals, stimulation, and comfort, especially consumers who seek comfort, as they are more likely to show a positive attitude and value IRAs, which could encourage behavior adherence. Advertising practitioners should target consumers who seek comfort to enhance personalized recommendation strategies via AI-driven IRAs. As IRAs proliferate in the advertising field, the findings offer implications that can enable advertisers and advertising academics and practitioners to better targeted audiences and enhance customer relationships.","[Kim, Juran] Jeonju Univ, Dept Business Adm, 518 Res Bldg 303 Cheonjamro, Jeonju 55069, Jeonbuk, South Korea; [Kang, Seungmook] Jeonju Univ, Dept Game Contents, Arts Hall Annex Room 303,303 Cheonjamro, Jeonju 55069, Jeonbuk, South Korea; [Bae, Joonheui] Kyungpook Natl Univ, Sch Business Adm, Daegu, South Korea",Jeonju University; Jeonju University; Kyungpook National University,"Kim, J (corresponding author), Jeonju Univ, Dept Business Adm, 518 Res Bldg 303 Cheonjamro, Jeonju 55069, Jeonbuk, South Korea.;Kang, S (corresponding author), Jeonju Univ, Dept Game Contents, Arts Hall Annex Room 303,303 Cheonjamro, Jeonju 55069, Jeonbuk, South Korea.;Bae, J (corresponding author), Kyungpook Natl Univ, Sch Business Adm, Daegu, South Korea.",jrkim@jj.ac.kr; xevious@jj.ac.kr; regina721@knu.ac.kr,,,Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea; National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2018S1A5A2A01031643],"Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea)",This work was supported by the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea and the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF-2018S1A5A2A01031643).,,85,2,2,15,55,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0265-0487,1759-3948,,INT J ADVERT,Int.

This study proposes a new metric, commercial audience retention (CAR), to measure a program's capability of retaining its audience when a commercial break occurs and develops a model to predict a program's CAR. The CAR metric and prediction model are tested and validated using a sufficient dataset with consumer TV viewing and program broadcast records for 1 year. We find that some factors that influence program ratings or commercial avoidance have no significant effect or have different effects on CAR.

Specifically, the results showed that in countries with high levels of national philanthropic environments there is a positive link between advertising intensity and corporate social responsibility, while in countries with lower national philanthropic environments, there is a negative link.","[Semenov, Alexey, V] Belmont Univ, Jack C Massey Coll Business, Dept Management, 1900 Belmt Blvd,Off 243, Nashville, TN 37212 USA; [Randrianasolo, Arilova] Butler Univ, Lacy Sch Business, Dept Mkt, Indianapolis, IN 46208 USA",Belmont University; Butler University,"Semenov, AV (corresponding author), Belmont Univ, Jack C Massey Coll Business, Dept Management, 1900 Belmt Blvd,Off 243, Nashville, TN 37212 USA.",alexey.semenov@belmont.edu,,,,,,,92,0,0,2,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0265-0487,1759-3948,,INT J ADVERT,Int.

The results of two experiments (n(1) = 114, n(2) = 208) revealed that, overall, young Chinese female consumers preferred advertising with Caucasian (versus East Asian), Cute/Girl-next-door (versus Sensual/Sex-kitten), and assertive (versus submissive) fashion models. Moreover, both Caucasian and East Asian models portrayed as Sensual/Sex-kitten types received more positive responses when posed as assertive rather than submissive. Caucasian models portrayed as Cute/Girl-next-door types received more positive responses when posed as assertive rather than submissive, whereas the opposite results were found for East Asian models.

Study 1 (N = 206) revealed that influencers' illness disclosure predicted attitudinal persuasion knowledge through transportation and parasocial interaction, further suggesting that illness disclosure reduces persuasion knowledge, causing people to perceive prescription drug ads on Instagram as less promotional. Study 2 (N = 181) replicated the mediating roles of transportation and parasocial interaction, demonstrating that first-person voice (vs. third-person) illness narrative in a patient influencer's medical device promotion on Instagram significantly predicted transportation, which then enhanced parasocial interaction with the influencer to influence eWOM intention as well as help-seeking intention. The two experiments demonstrate how influencers' illness disclosure narratives affect persuasion knowledge and online behavioral intention as well as real-life behavioral intention.

However, consumers often criticize the appropriation of this support for economic reasons, also called rainbowwashing. Building upon corporate hypocrisy and greenwashing research, we investigate under which circumstances participants perceive an ad as rainbowwashing in two experiments. In Study 1, we test the effects of claims (vague vs. concrete vs. no claim) and emotional imagery (imagery vs. no imagery). In Study 2, we replicate this design (comparing vague vs. concrete claims and imagery vs. no imagery). Results from Study 1 show that reading a vague claim elicited the highest perceptions of rainbowwashing compared to reading no or a concrete claim. Images did not show a main effect. In Study 2, claim vagueness had no direct effect, whereas imagery had a direct impact on perceived rainbowwashing. In both studies, involvement with LGBTQIA* issues was a significant moderator for the effect of imagery, so that highly involved individuals perceived less rainbowwashing when emotional and imagery was included. We discuss these findings in light of personal characteristics for the perception of rainbowwashing and draw conclusions for individual factors for the broader field of corporate hypocrisy.

Path analysis using data from college students (N = 273) in the U.S. supports the proposed dual-path relationships in the model. First, perceived endorser expertise (EE) mediates the effects of product-celebrity congruence (PCC) on attitude toward the ad (A(ad)). Furthermore, A(ad) mediates the effect of PCC on attitude toward the brand (A(b)). Second, perceived endorser trustworthiness (ET) mediates the effects of self-celebrity congruence (SCC) on A(ad.) Furthermore, A(ad) mediates the effect of SCC on A(b). The new framework contributes to celebrity endorsement literature by integrating two congruence factors and two source credibility dimensions into one model, and by uncovering the serial mediation relationships between these factors and attitude toward the ad and attitude toward the brand. In addition, this study focuses on the effects of congruence between actual self and celebrity for low-risk functional products, extending previous research that has focused on the congruence between ideal self and celebrity for symbolic products. The study findings have practical implications on celebrity selection and message framing according to advertisers' positioning strategies.","[Lee, Jung-Sook; Zhang, Lingling] Towson Univ, Mass Commun, Towson, MD 21252 USA; [Chang, Hua] Towson Univ, Mkt, Towson, MD 21252 USA",University System of Maryland; Towson University; University System of Maryland; Towson University,"Lee, JS (corresponding author), Towson Univ, Dept Mass Commun, Towson, MD 21252 USA.",jslee@towson.edu,,"Lee, Jung-Sook/0000-0002-5330-6594",,,,,74,0,0,11,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0265-0487,1759-3948,,INT J ADVERT,Int.

Study 2 explores the impact of media priming (a media story announcing a movie placement before the movie's release) and ad priming (a similar ad announcement) on recall through contrasts with no priming (control). US students watched a movie in a theatre after such priming for a subtle or a prominent placement. When compared to no priming, both media priming and ad priming enhanced recall for the subtle placement; no difference in recall performance emerged between no priming and either type of priming for the prominent placement. Contrast tests comparing media priming and ad priming indicated no differences in recall for either subtle or prominent placement. Study 3 replicated these recall findings with Italian moviegoers, and supported additional hypotheses and propositions for brand attitude. For the subtle (prominent) placement, attitude did not change (decreased) when comparing either media priming or ad priming with no priming. Contrast tests comparing media priming and ad priming indicated no differences in attitude outcomes, for either subtle or prominent placement. Using no priming as a baseline for comparison, the converging conclusion is that any type of priming improves (does not change) recall and does not change (worsens) attitude for subtle (prominent) placements. Overall, results do not support priming for prominent placements; selective use of any type of priming for subtle placements appears appropriate to improve recall outcomes.","[Balasubramanian, Siva K.] IIT, Stuart Sch Business, Chicago, IL USA; [Gistri, Giacomo] Univ Macerata, Dept Polit Sci Commun & Int Relat, Macerata, Italy",Illinois Institute of Technology; University of Macerata,"Balasubramanian, SK (corresponding author), 565 West Adams St,Suite 426, Chicago, IL 60661 USA.",sivakbalas@stuart.iit.edu,"GISTRI, Giacomo/G-1733-2018","GISTRI, Giacomo/0000-0003-2988-9758",,,,,52,1,1,3,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0265-0487,1759-3948,,INT J ADVERT,Int.

A systematic literature review of 84 IJA publications that address privacy in their content shows an increase of attention to privacy in advertising research. The review also reveals that privacy is connected to many different advertising formats and generally discussed in three ways: in the discussion of the context of advertising (i.e. ethics and regulations), in connection to personal traits that distinguish different consumers, and to explain advertising responses and effects. Theoretically, studies often draw upon the privacy paradox, privacy calculus model, personalization(-privacy) paradox, and persuasion knowledge model. Based on this review and current developments, we develop a research agenda for future advertising research addressing privacy, focusing on personalization in the public domain, privacy cynicism, and possible future constraints to personalization.","[Boerman, Sophie C.] Wageningen Univ & Res, Strateg Commun, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Smit, Edith G.] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Commun Res ASCoR, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research; University of Amsterdam,"Boerman, SC (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ & Res, Strateg Commun, Wageningen, Netherlands.",sophie.boerman@wur.nl,,"Smit, Edith/0000-0002-6913-4897; Boerman, Sophie/0000-0002-2453-1493",,,,,58,1,1,13,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0265-0487,1759-3948,,INT J ADVERT,Int.

In a simulated fitness influencer's Instagram posts, social presence significantly predicts individuals' purchase intent toward the brand featured in the posts as well as self-efficacy, working through parasocial interactions. Parasocial interaction with influencers serves as a mediator, while influencers can act as role models to motivate people to take action and benefit the brand by encouraging consumers to purchase the products featured in their posts. Higher social presence in the posts led individuals to feel that the posts were less promotional. The effect of parasocial interaction was moderated by advertising recognition, such that lower social presence posts appeared to suggest a promotional appeal and negatively affected purchase intent. Thus, social presence and parasocial interaction are key predictors of successful influencer marketing, yet they can pose a concern because they may hinder consumers from developing accurate persuasion knowledge.","[Kim, Hyosun] Indiana State Univ, Dept Commun, 217 N 6th St Gillum Hall,Third Floor, Terre Haute, IN 47809 USA",Indiana State University,"Kim, H (corresponding author), Indiana State Univ, Dept Commun, 217 N 6th St Gillum Hall,Third Floor, Terre Haute, IN 47809 USA.",Hyosun.Kim@indstate.edu,,,,,,,81,10,10,28,92,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0265-0487,1759-3948,,INT J ADVERT,Int.

The divide, which is more pronounced in some regions, is likely to worsen as society becomes more digitally complex, exacerbated by the lack of industry experience among young scholars entering academia in some quarters. Many bridging solutions were explored in this study, but the most important solution is for academia to produce relevant research, one that is useful for the industry. This should be widely and innovatively disseminated in a way that is easy to understand without dumbing it down. Practitioners generally do not like or know how to collaborate with academics, suggesting a need to develop a culture or mechanism that can raise awareness and foster mutual respect and trust between academia and industry. Bridging the divide will be challenging because of the existing academic reward structures. This situation needs to change. The discovery of two successful research institutes in the Netherlands and Australia shows how this divide can be bridged.","[Buzeta, C.] Univ los Andes, Sch Commun, Santiago, Chile; [Buzeta, C.] Univ Antwerp, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Mkt, Antwerp, Belgium; [Hirose, M.] Tokyo Fuji Univ, Fac Business Adm, Tokyo, Japan; [van Loggerenberg, M.

We provide evidence that visual pattern-seeking, which brings perceived control in such disruptions, is one of the adaptive responses. Across five studies, consumers primed with the perceived threat of COVID-19 increase their evaluations of visually patterned advertising images and behavioural intentions to follow visually patterned messages designed to reduce the spread of the virus. The underlying process for this effect is that visual pattern-seeking helps consumers regain control that is threatened by the perceived threat of the pandemic. These findings shed light on the role of visual patterns as an effective source of communication in the COVID-19 era.","[Lee, Jaehoon] Florida Int Univ, Dept Mkt & Logist, Coll Business, Miami, FL 33199 USA; [Park, Jooyoung] Peking Univ, HSBC Business Sch, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Lee, Jacob C.] Dongguk Univ, Dongguk Business Sch, 30 Pildong Ro 1 Gil, Seoul, South Korea; [Jhang, Jihoon] Univ Cent Arkansas, Dept Mkt & Management, Coll Business, Conway, AR USA; [Kim, Jungkeun] Auckland Univ Technol, Dept Mkt, 120 Mayoral Dr, Auckland 1010, New Zealand",State University System of Florida; Florida International University; Peking University; Dongguk University; University of Central Arkansas; Auckland University of Technology,"Lee, JC (corresponding author), Dongguk Univ, Dongguk Business Sch, 30 Pildong Ro 1 Gil, Seoul, South Korea.;Kim, J (corresponding author), Auckland Univ Technol, Dept Mkt, 120 Mayoral Dr, Auckland 1010, New Zealand.",lee.jacob.c@gmail.com; jkkim@aut.ac.nz,"Kim, Jungkeun/AAE-7216-2020","Kim, Jungkeun/0000-0003-2104-833X; Lee, Jaehoon/0000-0002-3514-8000; Jhang, Jihoon/0000-0001-9570-4024",,,,,79,0,0,8,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0265-0487,1759-3948,,INT J ADVERT,Int.

Across six decades, the four long-running textbooks reviewed herein exhibit striking continuity in their treatment of publicity - within and across editions. They assert that content in media is perceived by consumers to be objective, truthful, and credible because it is interpreted as news or editorial content; consumers trust news and editorial content more than advertising; and publicity is many times more powerful than advertising. Evidence suggests that consumers remain sceptical of advertising, exhibit increasing scepticism with regard to media, and perceive advertising practitioners and journalists as essentially equivalent with respect to honesty. A careful assessment of the efficacy of publicity is warranted as is an ethical evaluation of publicity as a covert marketing activity. These results serve as a reminder that the conventional wisdom conveyed in textbooks is often wrong at worst and lacks refinement at best.","[Ringold, Debra Jones] Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Ringold, Debra Jones] Willamette Univ, Atkinson Grad Sch Management, 900 State St, Salem, OR 97301 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; Willamette University,"Ringold, DJ (corresponding author), Willamette Univ, Atkinson Grad Sch Management, 900 State St, Salem, OR 97301 USA.",dringold@willamette.edu,,"Ringold, Debra/0000-0001-9361-4826","JELD WEN Foundation; Atkinson Graduate School of Management, Willamette University","JELD WEN Foundation; Atkinson Graduate School of Management, Willamette University","The JELD WEN Foundation and the Atkinson Graduate School of Management, Willamette University, provided financial support that made this research possible.

An online survey of Flemish readers (n = 500) and Flemish and Dutch authors (n = 97) measured attitudes towards the use of brand names and the practice of paid brand placement in fiction. Readers also reported their attitudes with regard to placement in film and TV programs. The results demonstrate that readers are favorable towards brand use in fiction. They also view the practice of paid placement as acceptable, perceive it as appropriate in most fiction genres, and are largely indifferent to the use of placement disclosures. Albeit perceptions are favorable across media in absolute terms, attitudes towards brands and paid placement in fiction, compared to film/TV programs, are less positive. Demographic characteristics and individual differences in reading motivation also predict readers' placement attitudes. Further, the results reveal that authors also perceive (paid) placement in fiction as acceptable, yet they appear more reserved about the practice than readers in our sample and see a higher need for disclosure regulation. Findings are discussed with relation to earlier work on general attitudes towards brand placement in other media and their implications for current theory and practice.","[Avramova, Yana R.; De Pelsmacker, Patrick; Dens, Nathalie] Univ Antwerp, Fac Business & Econ, Mkt Dept, Antwerp, Belgium; [De Pelsmacker, Patrick] Univ Ghent, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Dept Mkt Innovat & Org, Ghent, Belgium",University of Antwerp; Ghent University,"Avramova, YR (corresponding author), Univ Antwerp, Fac Business & Econ, Mkt Dept, Antwerp, Belgium.",yana.avrarnova@uantwerpen.be,,"Dens, Nathalie/0000-0003-0640-3727",Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) [1206119 N],Research Foundation Flanders (FWO)(FWO),This work was supported by a postdoctoral fellowship grant by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) awarded to the first author [grant number 1206119 N].,,74,0,0,2,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0265-0487,1759-3948,,INT J ADVERT,Int.

Replacements are oftentimes treated as one unambiguous construct. We reason that there are three disparate replacement types varying in audience responses because of differences in presence and type of visual context: 1) source without target context (e.g. diamond on neutral background), 2) source in target context (e.g. diamond on toothbrush) and 3) target in source context (e.g. tube of toothpaste on ring). We validated our refinement in an experiment with replacement type as within-subjects factor and perceived processing fluency and aesthetic pleasure as dependent variables. Metaphor comprehension was also taken into account. Participants saw 6 ads (2 per replacement type) for fictitious brands. Overall, perceived processing fluency and aesthetic pleasure were highest for source in target context ads. Source without target context ads and target in source context ads were perceived as equally fluent to process and aesthetically pleasing. For comprehended metaphors, perceived processing fluency was higher for target in source context ads than for source without target context ads. This study shows that Phillips and McQuarrie's replacement category needs to be refined. Studies comparing replacements with juxtapositions and fusions need to be wary of the crucial role of visual context. Replacements showing the source object in the context of the target (e.g. diamond on toothbrush) outperform the other replacement types.","[van Enschot, Renske] Tilburg Univ, Tilburg Ctr Cognit & Commun, Dept Commun & Cognit, POB 90153, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands; [van Hooijdonk, Charlotte] Univ Utrecht, Dept Languages Literature & Commun, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Bronkhorst, Ewald] Radboud Univ Nijmegen Med Ctr, Dept Hlth Evidence, Nijmegen, Netherlands",Tilburg University; Utrecht University; Radboud University Nijmegen,"Van Enschot, R (corresponding author), Tilburg Univ, Tilburg Ctr Cognit & Commun, Dept Commun & Cognit, POB 90153, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands.",r.vanenschot@tilburguniversity.edu,"Bronkhorst, Ewald/L-4230-2015","van Enschot, Renske/0000-0003-0692-4231",,,,,59,0,0,8,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0265-0487,1759-3948,,INT J ADVERT,Int.

Results revealed that people with enhanced advertising knowledge or with high message involvement led to greater advertising recognition, regardless of the degree of disclosure prominence. While on the other hand, when people's knowledge of sponsored influencer content was not enhanced or when they were low in message involvement, the prominent disclosure was more effective than the subtle one in improving advertising recognition. Furthermore, recognizing sponsored content elicited resistance, which in turn led to less favourable attitude towards the brand. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings were discussed.","[Yang, Guolan] Oakland Univ, Dept Commun Journalism & Publ Relat, 371 Wilson Blvd, Rochester, MI 48309 USA",Oakland University,"Yang, GL (corresponding author), Oakland Univ, Dept Commun Journalism & Publ Relat, 371 Wilson Blvd, Rochester, MI 48309 USA.",gyang3@oakland.edu,,"Yang, Guolan/0000-0002-8123-1841",,,,,50,0,0,16,34,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0265-0487,1759-3948,,INT J ADVERT,Int.

Findings revealed that Instagram product reviews with two-sided messages yielded higher influencer authenticity, influencer credibility, ad attitudes, and eWOM intentions than Instagram product reviews with one-sided messages. Results also revealed that the perceived authenticity and credibility of influencers with two-sided messages mediated effects on ad attitude, brand attitudes, purchase intention, and eWOM intention. Self-disclosure was not impactful, nor did product involvement moderate effects of influencer posts.

Guided by the Symbolic Sustainability Model (SSM), this study investigates the effects of communication about CSR initiatives comparing differing CSR approaches through a 2 x 2 between-subjects factorial experiment. After viewing a hypothetical CSR-based advertisement, participants (N = 433) rated their perceptions of initiative effectiveness and attitudes toward the initiative. Compared to a donation-based initiative, a CSR partnership had an indirect, positive effect on audience evaluations, which was mediated by perceptions of the likelihood of the corporation's sustained commitment to the partnership. The advertising that emphasized a partnership outperformed a donation-focused CSR initiative because participants perceived that the sponsoring corporation was invested in helping the cause for an extended period. The findings indicate that audiences are likely to perceive partnerships and donations positively; however, partnership initiatives may have stronger positive, indirect effects because they may be more likely to signal sustained commitment. The findings support the Symbiotic Sustainability Model (SSM) and demonstrate the efficacy of the SSM for CSR advertising.

Relying on the categorization theory, this research examines whether a relational communication strategy is effective in increasing company-cause fit when the functional similarity between a company and a cause is low. The findings of this study show that a relational ad message increases company-cause fit when the functional similarity is moderate, but not when the functional similarity is high or low. Also, based on the elaboration likelihood model, this research examines whether consumers' cause involvement moderates the effect of company-cause fit on attitude toward the CSR activity. The results show that the effect of company-cause fit on attitude toward the CSR activity is enhanced only for low involvement consumers.

In such situations, research on the recognition heuristic shows that people tend to choose more often the recognized option over the unrecognized one, as they infer it has the higher value regarding the criterion being judged. Since humans are particularly good at rapidly recognising familiar music, this paper examines the effect of recognition to influence brand choice when using music as the recognition cue. In two experiments (N = 486), participants were familiarised with several excerpts of advertising music. Participants then performed a choosing task to decide which of two brands they would purchase when searching for different products (e.g., headphones, cameras). Brands were either presented with familiar music clips or completely novel ones. Results showed that pairing brands with music that can be recognised by the target consumers increased brand choice by 6% (d = .21). Importantly, participants' preferences for the advertising music also influenced brand choice, increasing the effect of recognition when the music was liked and suppressing it in extreme cases when the music was most disliked. This suggests that ad practitioners should use a cue integration framework when working with music, weighing all available musical and extra-musical cues according to their impact on the target consumers. Results are discussed in terms of the practical implications of measuring brand's ROI when working with music and the value of the heuristics-and-biases framework to study music effects on consumer behaviour.","[Anglada-Tort, Manuel] Tech Univ Berlin, Dept Audio Commun, Berlin, Germany; [Anglada-Tort, Manuel] Max Planck Inst Empir Aesthet, Computat Auditory Percept Grp, Gruneburgweg 14, D-60322 Frankfurt, Germany; [Schofield, Kerry; Trahan, Tabitha; Mullensiefen, Daniel] Univ London, Dept Psychol, Goldsmiths, England; [Trahan, Tabitha] Soundout LLC, London, England",Technical University of Berlin; University of London; Goldsmiths University London,"Anglada-Tort, M (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Empir Aesthet, Computat Auditory Percept Grp, Gruneburgweg 14, D-60322 Frankfurt, Germany.",manuel.anglada-tort@ae.mpg.de,,"Mullensiefen, Daniel/0000-0001-7297-1760; Anglada-Tort, Manuel/0000-0003-3421-9361","Studienstiftung des Deutschen Volkes (Bonn, Germany)","Studienstiftung des Deutschen Volkes (Bonn, Germany)","This work was supported by a PhD studentship from the Studienstiftung des Deutschen Volkes (Bonn, Germany) awarded to Manuel Anglada-Tort.",,61,1,1,13,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0265-0487,1759-3948,,INT J ADVERT,Int.

Additionally, to reveal the underlying mechanism of the meaning transfer effect on brand attitudes, this study tests a moderated mediation model, highlighting transferred brand belief and original brand belief as two serial mediators. Results of an online experiment confirmed the transfer of celebrity traits to brands: Changes in brand beliefvand attitude were consistent with the valence of the celebrity's traits. More importantly, such a meaning transfer effect became stronger when lesser-known brands were associated with celebrities via co-branding. This effect pattern, however, did not hold for well-known brands. Lastly, regarding the meaning transfer mechanism, the results showed that celebrity meaning transfer first promoted the formation of brand meanings that correspond to celebrity traits, which then impacted original brand beliefs held by consumers, resulting in a change in brand attitudes. This study presents one of the earliest empirical investigations that compare the effects of celebrity endorsement and co-branding based on the meaning transfer theory. It not only provides much-needed causal evidence that directly supports the theory but also illustrates the strategic advantages of celebrity co-branding to capitalize on celebrities' influence.

The coding scheme and variables are based on main design elements in print advertising to examine the catalogs objectively. The results show that catalogs are not merely a media to advertise temporary price reductions, but they have evolved into a media tool to promote supermarkets' product range, including full-price products.

Using multidimensional scaling, we provide evidence of perceptual differences between celebrities and influencers beyond endorser attractiveness, credibility, expertise, and familiarity. We further study conditions in which endorser type is more or less effective in evoking favorable ad-related responses via consumers' inferences of an ad's manipulative intent. The results show that influencer endorsements in social media need to be subtle to achieve greater effectiveness than celebrity endorsements. In contrast, intrusive advertising in social media is more efficient when done in collaboration with celebrities. No significant differences emerge for endorsements in regular ad formats, though endorsements may benefit from higher awareness levels of celebrities. The findings help marketers make better informed choices between celebrity and influencer advertising collaborations.","[Graeve, Jan-Frederik] Univ Hamburg, Inst Mkt, Moorweidenstr 18, D-20148 Hamburg, Germany; [Bartsch, Fabian] Univ Montpellier, Montpellier Res Management, Montpellier Business Sch, Montpellier, France",University of Hamburg; Montpellier Business School; Universite de Montpellier,"Grave, JF (corresponding author), Univ Hamburg, Inst Mkt, Moorweidenstr 18, D-20148 Hamburg, Germany.",jan-frederik.graeve@uni-hamburg.de,,"Grave, Jan-Frederik/0000-0001-5408-3348; Bartsch, Fabian/0000-0001-7969-3687",,,,,93,1,1,27,75,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0265-0487,1759-3948,,INT J ADVERT,Int.

Teenagers can perceive strong, parasocial relationships with influencers, frequently regarding them as being akin to a peer or a friend. Furthermore, influencer endorsements are observed to carry greater credibility and authenticity than traditional forms of advertising. This therefore raises questions about young consumers' discernment of, and critical evaluation of the overall appropriateness when influencers act as conduits of commercial messages on behalf of brands. This paper reports on a qualitative study of 29 teenagers aged 15-17 years. The aim was to explore the participants' moral advertising literacy, namely their evaluations of the fairness and appropriateness of IM. The findings indicate whilst the participants were critical and sceptical towards the practice of IM in general (i.e. their dispositional advertising literacy), they were positively disposed towards specific commercial content emanating from specific influencers, (i.e. their situational literacy), often on the basis of the parasocial relationship that was seen to prevail between influencer and follower. This study therefore illustrates a gap between the teenagers' moral AL in the context of IM in general, and a corresponding willingness to apply this critical reflection, to known influencers.","[Sweeney, Emma; Lawlor, Margaret-Anne] Technol Univ Dublin, Sch Mkt, Dublin, Ireland; [Brady, Mairead] Trin Coll Dublin, Trin Business Sch, Dublin, Ireland",Trinity College Dublin,"Sweeney, E (corresponding author), Technol Univ Dublin, Sch Mkt, Dublin, Ireland.",emma.sweeney@tudublin.ie,,,,,,,52,4,4,27,66,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0265-0487,1759-3948,,INT J ADVERT,Int.

Extant research has not yet examined the efficacy of response strategies adopted by influencers when addressing negative comments. This study is to fill the research gap. An online experiment has been conducted among followers of an actual influencer to examine how influencers' response strategies (i.e. defensive vs. accommodative) to followers' negative comments (i.e. an objective complaint of product failure vs. a subjective dislike) affect the persuasiveness of influencer-sponsored content. The results of this study reveal that a defensive response harms influencer trustworthiness more than an accommodative response when it concerns a subjective disliking of the endorsed product. This lowered trustworthiness further leads to followers' decreased perceived product quality and less favourable brand attitudes. When it concerns an objective comment on product failure, an influencer's defensive response does not differ from accommodative response in affecting influencer trustworthiness. These findings indicate that an accommodative strategy may be an efficient way to cope with a negative follower comment, especially in case of a subjective product disliking.","[Hudders, Liselot; de Brabandere, Marloes] Univ Ghent, Dept Commun Sci, Korte Meer 11, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Hudders, Liselot] Univ Ghent, Dept Mkt, Ghent, Belgium; [Lou, Chen] Nanyang Technol Univ, Wee Kim Wee Sch Commun & Informat, Singapore, Singapore",Ghent University; Ghent University; Nanyang Technological University & National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore; Nanyang Technological University,"Hudders, L (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Dept Commun Sci, Korte Meer 11, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",Liselot.Hudders@Ugent.be,,"de Brabandere, Marloes/0000-0002-2121-1590",Tier 1 grant from Singapore's Ministry of Education [M4012201.060]; FWO [FWO.3E0.2015.0035.01],Tier 1 grant from Singapore's Ministry of Education; FWO(FWO),This work is partially funded by a Tier 1 grant from Singapore's Ministry of Education (grant number M4012201.060).

While this phenomenon is affecting any consumers cohort, millennials represent the lion's share among m-commerce users. Businesses are anyway struggling to better obtain the attention of a younger consumers. Indeed, the more competitors start to use m-commerce, the more differentiating communication strategies get difficult. To continue to attract the consideration from younger consumers, marketers are therefore adopting gamification as a strategic marketing lever. Thus, gamified advertisings -which are advertising characterized by high interactivity and game-like features- are becoming a trending topic in marketing literature. Building on Use and Gratification Theory (UGT) and Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), the research wishes to explore how consumers' experience deriving from Gamified Advertising (GAMEX) could contribute to the creation of consumers' benefits and their intention to purchase trough a mobile app. How gamification experience could correspondingly shape the attitude toward advertising has also been considered. To achieve the aim of the research, a structural model was tested trough data collected from 315 millennials living in the UK. Results show how a relationship between gamification induced experiences could foster in-app purchases. Anyway, such a connection is mediated by perceived consumer-benefits, their attitude toward advertising, and perceived advertising effectiveness. Gamified advertising thus can be effective if it could foster social, personal, hedonic and cognitive benefits, and whether gamification is perceived coherent with the advertised product/brand pair.","[Rialti, Riccardo; Zollo, Lamberto] Univ Milan, Dept Econ Management & Quantitat Methods DEMM, Via Conservatorio 7, I-20122 Milan, Italy; [Filieri, Raffaele] Audencia Business Sch, Dept Mkt, Nantes, France; [Bazi, Saleh] Yarmouk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Irbid, Jordan; [Ciappei, Cristiano] Univ Florence, Dept Econ & Management DISEI, Florence, Italy",University of Milan; Audencia; Yarmouk University; University of Florence,"Rialti, R (corresponding author), Univ Milan, Dept Econ Management & Quantitat Methods DEMM, Via Conservatorio 7, I-20122 Milan, Italy.",riccardo.rialti@unimi.it,"Bazi, Saleh/CAE-9827-2022; Bazi, Saleh/ABE-6377-2020; Filieri, Raffaele/AAK-2553-2021","Bazi, Saleh/0000-0002-1850-8799; Filieri, Raffaele/0000-0002-3534-8547; Zollo, Lamberto/0000-0002-8162-8136; RIALTI, Riccardo/0000-0002-0365-286X; CIAPPEI, CRISTIANO/0000-0002-4153-1110",,,,,95,1,1,32,59,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0265-0487,1759-3948,,INT J ADVERT,Int.

The data set was analysed by decade to reveal topics addressed, theories relied upon, methodologies adopted, and countries examined. Despite variation in the topics addressed over the years, topics present in every decade included cross-cultural issues/differences and gender issues/role portrayals. Global Consumer Culture/Positioning was used as a theoretical foundation in studies published during the journal's early years and has grown in popularity over the decades. Theories pertaining to cross-cultural differences, such as those developed by Hofstede and GLOBE were among the most frequently employed theoretical foundations. While content analyses were often utilized, surveys, experiments, and qualitative research methods are becoming more popular methods of investigation.

To effectively communicate with these populations on issues and biomedical advancements impacting them, health advertising has started applying identity-specific approaches and integrating political activism in their strategies. The present study examines how different identity-specific sex-positive depictions (i.e., heterosexual, queer) in a Black-centric health advertising campaign on the HIV-preventative drug, PrEP, interact with the audience's identity to influence the Black cisgender heterosexual and Black LGBTQ-identified Americans' (N = 615) responses to PrEP and the campaign. Moreover, the study examines whether such joint effects are moderated by how the campaign incorporates activism (i.e., intersectional, non-intersectional, no activism). The findings demonstrated that identity-specific sex-positive depiction indeed interacted with audience identity to impact perceived susceptibility to contracting HIV, response efficacy, intention to adopt PrEP when offered for free, and positive attitudes towards the campaign. Especially, groups with various levels of intersectional marginalization responded differently to the effects of identity-specific depiction.","[Li, Minjie] Univ Tennessee, Coll Commun & Informat, Tombras Sch Advertising & Publ Relat, 1345 Circle Pk Dr,476 Commun Bldg, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA",University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville,"Li, MJ (corresponding author), Univ Tennessee, Coll Commun & Informat, Tombras Sch Advertising & Publ Relat, 1345 Circle Pk Dr,476 Commun Bldg, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.",minjie@utk.edu,,,Research Innovation and Scholarly Excellence (RISE) grant from the University of Tampa,Research Innovation and Scholarly Excellence (RISE) grant from the University of Tampa,This work was supported by the Research Innovation and Scholarly Excellence (RISE) grant from the University of Tampa.,,102,0,0,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0265-0487,1759-3948,,INT J ADVERT,Int.

However, more research is needed on the specific influencer characteristics driving this success, and the processes responsible for these effects. In this study, we investigated to what extent product-influencer fit and number of followers interact in contributing to positive advertising outcomes and influencer evaluations. Moreover, we investigated to what extent perceived credibility of the influencer and identification with the influencer mediate these relationships. We conducted a 2 (poor vs. good product-influencer fit) X 2 (moderate vs. high number of followers) between-subjects experiment among 432 Dutch Instagram users. Participants were exposed to Instagram posts of health and fitness influencers who endorsed either a protein shake (good-fit) or ice cream (poor-fit). Results showed that fit and number of followers seem to work in tandem: although influencers with a high number of followers are liked more, and their endorsements result in a more positive attitude toward both the ad and product, and a greater likelihood to buy the advertised product as compared to influencers with a moderate number of followers, the endorsed product should fit the influencer's self-branded image for these positive effects to occur. Moreover, effects were all mediated by perceived credibility and identification, which appear to be important drivers of influencer endorsement effects. Together, our findings contribute to a growing body of knowledge on the processes driving audience responses to influencer marketing, and provide clear guidelines for practitioners.","[Janssen, Loes; Schouten, Alexander P.; Croes, Emmelyn A.

This research examines how consumers' level of religious commitment and geographic location influence response to death primes in advertisements. Using terror management theory as a conceptual framework, three experiments examine differences between consumers sampled from countries in Asia and the Americas. Study 1 reveals that consumers sampled from an Asian (vs. American) country respond more positively to death primes (vs. no prime) in advertisements. Study 2 replicates these findings and shows that religious commitment moderates such effects, with lower religious commitment consumers being more reactive to death primes than higher religious commitment consumers. Study 3 confirms religion's influence by priming religion and identifies perceived product need as mediating the relationship between the interaction of religion x death prime x country and advertised product evaluations. Practical implications for international advertising are provided.","[Minton, Elizabeth A.] Univ Wyoming, Dept Management & Mkt, Coll Business, 1000 E Univ Ave,Dept 3275, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Park, Heejung] Northern Michigan Univ, Dept Mkt, Coll Business, Marquette, MI USA; [Spielmann, Nathalie] NEOMA Business Sch, Dept Mkt, Reims, France",University of Wyoming; Northern Michigan University,"Minton, EA (corresponding author), Univ Wyoming, Dept Management & Mkt, Coll Business, 1000 E Univ Ave,Dept 3275, Laramie, WY 82071 USA.",eminton@uwyo.edu,"Park, Hee Jung/GXV-9056-2022; Park, Heejung/AAH-1300-2021","Park, Hee Jung/0000-0003-1958-7852; Park, Heejung/0000-0003-1958-7852; Spielmann, Nathalie/0000-0002-9860-3269",,,,,110,1,1,4,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0265-0487,1759-3948,,INT J ADVERT,Int.

Yet it is challenging for brands to know how to communicate efficiently. To fill this gap, the current research aims to provide a systematic framework that could guide advertisers in designing pandemic-themed advertisements to stimulate consumer engagement on social media by examining the role of values in context-specific brand communications. In particular, we analyze a large corpus of 286 brand YouTube videos posted between the onset of the COVID-19 and the fall of 2020 through a combination of qualitative induction, coding, and big data analytics. The results demonstrate that brands can incorporate various values in their brand communications when the world is combating a victim crisis like the current pandemic. Our findings reveal that hedonism, universalism, conformity, security, and tradition values positively predict consumer engagement (i.e., commenting), whereas stimulation value negatively predicts consumer commenting. We develop a new type of victim crisis - omnipresent victim crisis - and offer a theorization of this sub-type of victim crisis to delineate the pandemic or crises alike (e.g., environmental issues) for future research. We further highlight the role of value embodiment in crisis communication and advertising literature and offer rich theoretical and practical implications.","[Lou, Chen; Zhou, Xuan] Nanyang Technol Univ, Wee Kim Wee Sch Commun & Informat, Singapore 637718, Singapore; [Huang, Xun (Irene)] Nanyang Technol Univ, Nanyang Business Sch, Singapore, Singapore; [Qiu, Chen] Northwestern Polytech Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Xian, Peoples R China; [Yuan, Mingquan] Sams Club Innovat Ctr, Dallas, TX USA",Nanyang Technological University & National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore; Nanyang Technological University; Nanyang Technological University & National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore; Nanyang Technological University; Northwestern Polytechnical University,"Lou, C (corresponding author), Nanyang Technol Univ, Wee Kim Wee Sch Commun & Informat, Singapore 637718, Singapore.",chenlou@ntu.edu.sg,,,"Ministry of Education, Singapore [M4012201.060]","Ministry of Education, Singapore(Ministry of Education, Singapore)","This study is supported by the first author's Tier 1 grant from the Ministry of Education, Singapore (number: M4012201.060).",,77,0,0,6,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0265-0487,1759-3948,,INT J ADVERT,Int.

In order to avoid such impairment effects, the current research demonstrates why advertisers need to develop creative advertising.","[Jin, Hyun Seung; Kerr, Gayle; Sheehan, Ben] Queensland Univ Technol, QUT Business Sch, 2 George St, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia; [Suh, Jaebeom] Kansas State Univ, Coll Business Adm, Dept Mkt, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Kim, Hyoje Jay] Univ Strathclyde, Dept Mkt, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland",Queensland University of Technology (QUT); Kansas State University; University of Strathclyde,"Jin, HS (corresponding author), Queensland Univ Technol, QUT Business Sch, 2 George St, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia.",hsjin@qut.edu.au,,"Kerr, Gayle/0000-0002-5463-600X",,,,,43,1,1,24,37,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0265-0487,1759-3948,,INT J ADVERT,Int.

First, a content analysis examined the presence of graphic sexual appeals in posts for the most followed fashion brands on Instagram, and the extent to which the number of likes and comments on these posts were related to the graphic nature of the appeal. Second, a set of experiments utilizing national consumer panels examined how consumer evaluations of graphic sexual ads on social media differ from those of non-sexual ads, and to what extent the evaluations are influenced by sexual self-schema (SSS) and respondent country (US vs Korea). The results indicate that the use of sexual appeal is primarily limited to sexually positioned brands, but graphic sexual appeals can increase the number of likes and comments on their branded SNS contents. Moreover, while consumers are somewhat reluctant to click like and share the sexual SNS contents, their intentions to like and share can be positively enhanced by their SSS level and cultural orientation of individualism.","[Choi, Hojoon] Univ Houston, Coll Liberal Arts & Social Sci, Jack J Valenti Sch Commun, Houston, TX USA; [Yoo, Kyunga] KT Corp, Corporate Image Dept, Seoul, South Korea; [Reichert, Tom] Univ South Carolina, Coll Informat & Commun, Columbia, SC USA; [Northup, Temple] San Diego State Univ, Coll Profess Studies & Fine Arts, Sch Journalism & Media Studies, San Diego, CA 92182 USA",University of Houston System; University of Houston; University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia; California State University System; San Diego State University,"Yoo, K (corresponding author), KT Corp, Corporate Image Dept, Seoul, South Korea.",muse@kt.com,,,,,,,64,2,2,10,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0265-0487,1759-3948,,INT J ADVERT,Int.

The findings from two studies that combined qualitative (42 semi-structured interviews and netnography) and quantitative (content analysis of 1,102 ads) research methods showed that individuals are motivated to produce sponsored video advertising by six factors: learning, enjoyment, self-expression, remuneration, recognition and influencing others. In turn, these motivations can be categorised as intrinsic, extrinsic, rational and affective, leading to a typology of four advertising creators. It was found also that individuals tend to use narrative forms of advertising more when creating commercial ads, and expository forms more when creating nonprofit ads. The study demonstrates that individuals are willing to co-create and transmit brand value by producing sponsored video ads, and have become an essential element of marketing communications in the digital era. Organisations may benefit from sponsored CGA by gathering consumers' insights, through improved individual-organisation relationships and by obtaining promotional material that might persuade audiences and stimulate online conversations.","[Martinez-Navarro, Jesus] Univ Alicante, Fac Econ & Business Sci, Dept Mkt, Alicante, Spain; [Bigne, Enrique] Univ Valencia, Fac Econ, Dept Mkt, Av Naranjos S-N, Valencia 46022, Spain",Universitat d'Alacant; University of Valencia,"Bigne, E (corresponding author), Univ Valencia, Fac Econ, Dept Mkt, Av Naranjos S-N, Valencia 46022, Spain.",enrique.bigne@uv.es,"Bigné, Enrique/D-9287-2015; Martínez-Navarro, Jesús/GXV-1258-2022","Bigné, Enrique/0000-0002-6529-7605; Martínez-Navarro, Jesús/0000-0002-6430-3014","Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities of the Government of Spain [PID2019-111195RB-I00]","Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities of the Government of Spain(Spanish Government)","This work was supported by the Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities of the Government of Spain under ID grant number: PID2019-111195RB-I00.",,104,0,0,19,49,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0265-0487,1759-3948,,INT J ADVERT,Int.

In this study, we analyzed people's posts on Twitter about AI in advertising using natural language processing. Specifically, we conducted topic modeling and sentiment analysis in the Python environment to identify the most salient topics on this issue and the sentiment of these topics. We discovered that what people posted on Twitter about AI in advertising fell into eight different clusters, with the most positive topic being AI-powered marketing tools and the most negative topic being AI's involvement in social media campaigns. We believe the findings of this study provide meaningful implications for academic research of AI advertising as well as the implementation of AI in advertising practice.","[Wu, Linwan; Wen, Taylor Jing] Univ South Carolina, Sch Journalism & Mass Commun, Coll Informat & Commun, 800 Sumter St,Room 328, Columbia, SC 29208 USA; [Dodoo, Naa Amponsah] Emerson Coll, Mkt Commun Dept, Boston, MA 02116 USA",University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia,"Wu, LW (corresponding author), Univ South Carolina, Sch Journalism & Mass Commun, Coll Informat & Commun, 800 Sumter St,Room 328, Columbia, SC 29208 USA.",linwanwu@mailbox.sc.edu,,"Wu, Linwan/0000-0002-5294-3559",,,,,54,1,1,8,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0265-0487,1759-3948,,INT J ADVERT,Int.

Six hypotheses were tested through a between-groups experimental design utilizing two ad stimuli-one that showed a progressive/nurturing dad and one that showed a hypermasculine/traditional dad. Findings indicate that dadvertisements depicting nurturing fathers were evaluated more positively on emotional responses, wishful identification, and progressive ad perceptions than hypermasculine/traditional portrayals. Increased anxiety was related to less positive emotions toward, and weakness perceptions of, the modern fatherhood ad stimulus, as well as less positive perceptions of, and wishful identification with, the advertisement. Finally, mediation effects were found among positive emotional responses, positive dad perceptions, and wishful identification on dadvertising outcome variables, including more positive attitudes toward the ad, brand, and empowerment.

Findings showed that brand information (i.e. size of the brand logo and brand name) tended to lead to lower engagement levels in general, although luxury brands showed the opposite pattern. More interestingly, while providing luxury brand information in the image invited positive responses, there seemed to be backfire effects when such information (i.e. brand name) was highly prominent. In addition, sharing promotional information was likely to prompt a lower level of interaction.

The current research identified unique consumer motivations for following SMIs on Instagram and examined its association with important consumer behaviour outcomes (i.e. trust towards SMIs' brand-related posts and frequency of purchasing SMI-recommended brands) as well as materialism. Based on survey data, findings revealed four motivations for following influencers on Instagram - authenticity, consumerism, creative inspiration, and envy - which had varying effects on trust and purchase frequency. Additionally, materialism was a significant individual difference variable that was strongly associated with the four motives, some of which served as key mediators underlying materialism's impact on purchase behaviour.

Hence, this study investigates the conditions under which a service entity of a brand can optimize their potential. To this end, the current study conceptualizes and operationalizes two dimensions that define chatbots' capabilities - message contingency (i.e., contingency-based interactivity) and emotional intelligence (i.e., sympathy). Based on two experiments, we found that, regarding the same online customer service of an apparel brand, participants rated the human employee to be more competent and warmer than a chatbot. When a human employee who expresses sympathy to the afflicted customer during the conversation, participants considered the employee to be more competent when he/she also exhibits contingency (vs. no contingency) during the conversation, which in turn, elicited higher patronage intentions among participants.","[Lou, Chen; Kang, Hyunjin] Nanyang Technol Univ, Wee Kim Wee Sch Commun & Informat, 31 Nanyang Link,03-13, Singapore 637718, Singapore; [Tse, Caleb H.] Nanyang Technol Univ, Nanyang Business Sch, Div Mkt, Singapore, Singapore",Nanyang Technological University & National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore; Nanyang Technological University; Nanyang Technological University & National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore; Nanyang Technological University,"Lou, C (corresponding author), Nanyang Technol Univ, Wee Kim Wee Sch Commun & Informat, 31 Nanyang Link,03-13, Singapore 637718, Singapore.",chenlou@ntu.edu.sg,"Tse, Caleb H./GWM-8502-2022","Kang, Hyunjin/0000-0002-8076-7126; Tse, Caleb/0000-0003-0572-8829",,,,,91,8,8,33,99,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0265-0487,1759-3948,,INT J ADVERT,Int.

Based on the benefits of personalization and music liking, we hypothesized that ad music personalization would positively affect ad view time and attitudes toward the ad. We also explored effects on attitudes toward the advertised product. We further hypothesized that perceived ad duration plays a role in responses to personalized ad music. We conducted two experiments that simulated a natural environment of viewing skippable online ads accompanied by music tracks. Study 1 tested the effects of measured music liking, whereas Study 2 manipulated the music to either match or not match participants' preferences. As expected, we found a consistent positive effect of ad music personalization on ad view time. Study 1 revealed that this effect counteracts the general trend of diminishing ad view time as a function of later placement in a batch. Study 2 further found that personalized ad music reduces perceived ad duration, positively affecting ad attitudes as well. Effects on attitudes toward the advertised product were less pronounced. Thus, this research, which uniquely focuses on personalization of an ad's background factor, offers nuanced insights into an instrument that has never been studied before, and may enhance the effectiveness of marketing communications through its impact on consumer reactions.","[Maroely, Ran; Munichor, Nira] Bar Ilan Univ, Grad Sch Business Adm, IL-5290002 Ramat Gan, Israel",Bar Ilan University,"Munichor, N (corresponding author), Bar Ilan Univ, Grad Sch Business Adm, IL-5290002 Ramat Gan, Israel.",nira.munichor@biu.ac.il,,,,,,,139,0,0,19,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0265-0487,1759-3948,,INT J ADVERT,Int.

Brands have been admonished to increase the presence of older women in their ads. However, it is unclear how older women wish to be depicted in ads. This study used an interpretative phenomenology analysis (IPA) approach to explore older women's preferences regarding model appearance and roles in ads targeted toward them. Interviews were conducted with twenty women aged 53 to 71; all were white, none were severely disabled, and none were in financial distress. Participants expressed a preference for belonging: to see models that represent their actual age shown in groups of older women or with women of different ages. In addition, common advertising stereotypes were reframed using participants' preferences to portray authentic identities: from ageless beauty to age-appropriate and attractive, and from traditional granny to woman of purpose. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.","[Phillips, Barbara J.] Univ Saskatchewan, Edwards Sch Business, 25 Campus Dr, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5A7, Canada",University of Saskatchewan,"Phillips, BJ (corresponding author), Univ Saskatchewan, Edwards Sch Business, 25 Campus Dr, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5A7, Canada.",bphillips@edwards.usask.ca,,,,,,,76,1,1,4,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0265-0487,1759-3948,,INT J ADVERT,Int.

Yet many popular influencers endorse far more than one brand. Earlier research on multiple endorsements by celebrity testimonials and their effects on both brand and endorser evaluations produced mixed results. This article investigates the consequences of multiple endorsements in an influencer context. We conducted a between-subjects online experiment in which we varied the number of brand endorsements (one, three, seven endorsements) presented by an influencer. Results show that multiple influencer endorsements affect the performance of evaluative persuasion knowledge and subsequent coping behaviors, which in turn negatively affect brand attitude and perceived influencer authenticity. Coping with influencer endorsements is generally moderated by participants' parasocial relationships with the influencer. However, parasocial relationships appear not to be relevant in specifically processing multiple endorsements. Based on these findings, we discuss theoretical implications for researching influencer marketing from a persuasion knowledge model (PKM) perspective.","[Borchers, Nils S.] Univ Tubingen, Inst Media Studies, Wilhelmstr 50, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany; [Hagelstein, Jens] Univ Leipzig, Inst Commun & Media Studies, Leipzig, Germany; [Beckert, Johannes] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Dept Commun, Mainz, Germany",Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen; Leipzig University; Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz,"Borchers, NS (corresponding author), Univ Tubingen, Inst Media Studies, Wilhelmstr 50, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany.",nils.borchers@uni-tuebingen.de,,"Beckert, Johannes/0000-0003-1418-0818; Borchers, Nils S./0000-0001-9600-066X; Hagelstein, Jens/0000-0002-6057-6699",,,,,63,1,1,31,36,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0265-0487,1759-3948,,INT J ADVERT,Int.

Beyond the emphases of prior research on ad disclosure and format relevancy of native advertising, the current research contributes to the literature by first testing the relationship between the native ad and social media content by varying the thematic content relevancy of the ad (irrelevant vs. relevant) and second, adding media context effects to the equation by changing the thematic media content consistency (low vs. high) of the surrounding social media posts in the feed. Across three experiments, the ad relevancy effect was significant. The ad relevant to the surrounding content posts decreased ad intrusiveness and increased positive ad or brand attitude compared to an irrelevant ad in high media content consistency settings. In low media content consistency settings, the ad's relevancy did not matter as much. Moderated mediation found that higher ad intrusiveness drove lower ad attitude and brand attitude for the irrelevant ad only in the high content consistency condition. This relationship did not occur for the low content consistency condition. The findings highlight the importance of testing thematic ad-content relevancy in digital media settings that present novel content presentation formats. Theoretical implications are provided regarding the psychological appeal of relevancy and the different media contexts where schema theory can be more or less applicable. Practical implications on how to place 'in-feed' native ads and how social media platforms may facilitate contextual ad targeting, given the different media content consistency backdrop, are discussed.","[Yoon, Hye Jin] Univ Georgia, Grady Coll Journalism & Mass Commun, Dept Advertising & Publ Relat, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Huang, Yan] Univ Houston, Jack J Valenti Sch Commun, Houston, TX USA; [Kim, Taeyeon] Kwangwoon Univ, Sch Media & Commun, Seoul, South Korea",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; University of Houston System; University of Houston; Kwangwoon University,"Yoon, HJ (corresponding author), Univ Georgia, Grady Coll Journalism & Mass Commun, Dept Advertising & Publ Relat, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",hjyoon@uga.edu,,,,,,,75,0,0,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0265-0487,1759-3948,,INT J ADVERT,Int.

Bystanders can play an important role in providing assistance, and the motivation to intervene depends on various underlying factors. The uncertainty caused by the pandemic has encouraged people to find solace and hope in religion and spirituality. Using goal congruity and priming theories, we treated religiosity and spirituality as separate constructs and investigated their impact on attitude toward helping victims and intention to engage in direct intervention (i.e. knocking on the door) or indirect intervention (i.e. calling the advertised helpline) among Hindus in India. Findings show that only spirituality influenced intention, via attitude, to engage in indirect intervention, while only religiosity directly influenced intention to engage in direct intervention. In terms of goal congruity, priming the advertised intervention (i.e. direct or indirect) triggered the salience of one's religious (i.e. ego-driven self-enhancement) or spiritual (i.e. altruism) goals.

With the growth of online video platforms, various ad formats have been experimented to increase advertising effectiveness. One such attempt is pre-roll skippable ads that allow users to skip an ad after watching it for a few seconds. Despite pre-roll ads providing better user experience, their high skipping rate is alarming to advertisers and brands. Recent studies revealed what factors influence pre-roll ad acceptance, yet little has been known regarding the role of device type. This study investigates how mobile users respond to pre-roll skippable ads differently than PC users, focusing on individual and contextual factors of video consumption. Using individual-level clickstream data obtained from a major online video platform in South Korea, this study found that mobile users tend to skip pre-roll ads more often than PC users, but the degree differs by individual and contextual factors.","[Kim, Su Jung] Univ Southern Calif, Annenberg Sch Commun & Journalism, Publ Relat, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA; [Lee, Mi Hyun] Northwestern Univ, Integrated Mkt Commun, Medill Sch Journalism Media Integrated Mkt Commun, Evanston, IL USA; [Hong, Juwon; Park, Sungho] Seoul Natl Univ, SNU Business Sch, Seoul, South Korea",University of Southern California; Northwestern University; Seoul National University (SNU),"Park, S (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, SNU Business Sch, Seoul, South Korea.",spark104@snu.ac.kr,"Kim, Su Jung/Q-2438-2019; Hong, Juwon/GQI-3209-2022","Kim, Su Jung/0000-0003-2025-4019; Lee, Mi Hyun/0000-0001-9747-2888",Institute of Management Research at Seoul National University,Institute of Management Research at Seoul National University,This study was supported by the Institute of Management Research at Seoul National University (grant number: N/A).,,48,0,0,9,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0265-0487,1759-3948,,INT J ADVERT,Int.

As sincere brands are well aligned with gratitude expressions, we theorize that a messaging strategy solely expressing gratitude fails to yield brand benefits beyond a message where gratitude is not expressed. However, sincere brands can reap more brand benefits when their advertised gratitude expression is perceived as effortful (e.g., thank you message coupled with a free product). We demonstrate that when sincere brands engage in these high-effort expressions of gratitude, consumers evaluate the brand more positively, an effect mediated by brand trust. We also explore when sincere brands may benefit from low-effort gratitude expressions. Specifically, we find that consumer reactions to low-effort acknowledgments are more favorable when consumers identify with the gratitude target. Based on these findings, we detail our contributions to theory and provide managerial implications for sincere brands wishing to express gratitude.","[Thomas, Veronica] Old Dominion Univ, Mkt, Norfolk, VA USA; [Bock, Dora; McCullough, Heath] Auburn Univ, Mkt, Auburn, AL 36849 USA",Old Dominion University; Auburn University System; Auburn University,"Thomas, V (corresponding author), Old Dominion Univ, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA.",vlthomas@odu.edu,,,,,,,68,0,0,4,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0265-0487,1759-3948,,INT J ADVERT,Int.

Companies are not successfully tapping into the inherent potential of social media communication. This theoretical review integrates extant CSR and social media communication research to contribute to a better understanding of the processes involved in CSR effectiveness on social media. We develop a theoretical model of CSR social media communication, that takes into account its specific characteristics-sensitivity to peer influences through norm activation, interactivity, viral CSR message propagation through sharing, CSR empowerment, and humane-oriented appeals in CSR posts. The hypothesized framework connects CSR and social media-specific drivers with two social media CSR communication outcomes: i) CSR effectiveness in terms of CSR associations, corporate/brand attitude and purchase behavior, and ii) social media performance indicators related to propagation on the network-social media endorsement and opposition (liking, positive and negative commenting, and sharing of the CSR post). The model explains the resulting relationships through mediation processes based on CSR credibility and motive attribution, psychological consumer empowerment, moral emotions, as well as social identity and norm activation. Self-construal and community identification are identified as consumer-based contingency factors of these effects. The review framework provides an extended process-oriented agenda for future studies. The paper recommends multi-brand experimental field studies in a real-life social media setting and highlights the requirement of industry collaboration. The expected findings will help companies to choose relevant CSR initiatives, design effective CSR posts, boost viral propagation on the network, and counter and avoid social media opposition through negative feedback.","[Fernandez, Paula; Hartmann, Patrick; Apaolaza, Vanessa] Univ Basque Country UPV EHU, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Avda Lehendakari Aguirre 83, Bilbao 48015, Spain",University of Basque Country,"Hartmann, P (corresponding author), Univ Basque Country UPV EHU, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Avda Lehendakari Aguirre 83, Bilbao 48015, Spain.",patrick.hartmann@ehu.eus,"Hartmann, Patrick/J-7948-2012; Apaolaza, Vanessa/AAB-2801-2019","Hartmann, Patrick/0000-0001-5922-3098; APAOLAZA IBANEZ, VANESA/0000-0003-3252-3036","Spanish Government; European Regional Development Fund [ECO2016-76348-R]; Basque Government [GIC 15/128, IT-952-16]; FESIDE Foundation",Spanish Government(Spanish GovernmentEuropean Commission); European Regional Development Fund(European Commission); Basque Government(Basque Government); FESIDE Foundation,"This research was supported by the Spanish Government and European Regional Development Fund [grant numbers ECO2016-76348-R, AEI/FEDER, UE], the Basque Government [grant numbers GIC 15/128; IT-952-16] and FESIDE Foundation.",,140,9,9,34,72,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0265-0487,1759-3948,,INT J ADVERT,Int.

Specifically, a survey (N = 345) was conducted to examine how consumers' cognitive and affective involvement regarding the issue of NFL national anthem protests, their brand attachment, and brand attitude guide their attitudes and word-of-mouth intentions in response to Nike's corporate social advocacy practices. The findings of this study suggested that consumers' support for a company's CSA efforts could depend on their involvement in the social issue that a brand chose as well as their involvement in the brand. Moreover, the interaction of issue involvement and brand attachment factors can serve as a segmentation strategy to cement brand loyalty and strengthen the relationship with the existing stakeholders whose issue attitude was congruent with the corporation's stances. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.","[Li, Jo-Yun] Univ Miami, Dept Strateg Commun, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA; [Kim, Joon Kyoung; Alharbi, Khalid] Univ South Carolina, Sch Journalism & Mass Commun, Columbia, SC 29208 USA; [Kim, Joon Kyoung] Univ Rhode Isl, Harrington Sch Commun & Media, Kingston, RI 02881 USA; [Alharbi, Khalid] Al Imam Mohammad Ibn Saud Islamic Univ IMSIU, Coll Media & Commun, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia",University of Miami; University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia; University of Rhode Island; Imam Mohammad Ibn Saud Islamic University (IMSIU),"Li, JY (corresponding author), Univ Miami, Dept Strateg Commun, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA.",queenie.li@miami.edu,"Kim, Joon Kyoung/AAD-4898-2019; Alharbi, Khalid Khalaf/GYV-3906-2022","Kim, Joon Kyoung/0000-0001-9325-5667; Alharbi, Khalid Khalaf/0000-0001-8355-5033; Li, Jo-Yun/0000-0003-0245-7306; Alharbi, Khalid/0000-0001-8176-6347",,,,,96,5,5,4,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0265-0487,1759-3948,,INT J ADVERT,Int.

This study examines the potential interplay of perceived homophily with, perceived authenticity of an influencer and the reasons people may follow an influencer on subsequent purchase intentions of items the influencer has showcased on their Instagram account. Key findings suggest that the type of perceived homophily one shares with their favorite influencer is linked to the reasons they follow that influencer, and that following an influencer because they are trendy when a person also indicated perceived status homophily (e.g., similarities in size) did lead to increased purchase intent. However, influencers that are followed because they are unique and share morals and values with a follower (i.e., 'value homophily') do not encourage purchase intent. We find that an influencer who is perceived as more 'authentic' will mediate the relationship between perceptions of homophily and subsequent purchase intent.","[Shoenberger, Heather] Penn State Univ, Donald P Bellisario Coll Commun, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [(Anna) Kim, Eunjin] Univ Southern Calif, Annenberg Sch Commun & Journalism, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; University of Southern California,"Shoenberger, H (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Donald P Bellisario Coll Commun, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",hus503@psu.edu,"Kim, Eunjin/AAB-4229-2019","Kim, Eunjin/0000-0003-4007-4461",,,,,45,1,1,43,43,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0265-0487,1759-3948,,INT J ADVERT,Int.

To address this research gap, this study investigates the underlying mechanisms that help explain the relationship between endorser attractiveness and advertising outcomes (interest in the ad and message attitudes): endorser match-up and endorser identification. The empirical study consists of a single-factor (three groups divided by their level of attractiveness), between-subjects experimental design, two LGBTQ-relevant advertisements, and 369 gay male participants. Our findings show similar effects between average and highly stereotypically attractive models (i.e., ASAMs and HSAMs), and strong evidence that average or high physical attractiveness would act as an effective match-up factor of gay-themed ads, and this in turn would increase attitudinal advertising outcomes. Similarly, individuals who identify with average- or good-looking endorsers report higher levels of interest in products associated with the respective endorsers. Despite the similar scores between ASAMs and HSAMs, they convey different associations, information that can be used in different advertising settings. Our main goal is to gain a better understanding of the gay male segment and help advertisers and scholars in delivering persuasive public service announcements.","[Flores-Zamora, Javier] ICN Business Sch, Quartier 207 Friedrichstr, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Flores-Zamora, Javier] Univ Lorraine, CEREFIGE Lab, Nancy, France",Universite de Lorraine,"Flores-Zamora, J (corresponding author), ICN Business Sch, Quartier 207 Friedrichstr, D-10117 Berlin, Germany.;Flores-Zamora, J (corresponding author), CEREFIGE Lab, Nancy, France.",javier.flores@icn-artem.com,,,,,,,87,0,0,3,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0265-0487,1759-3948,,INT J ADVERT,Int.

However, no empirical research is available yet that examines how the influencer's gender affects the persuasiveness of sponsored content posted by this influencer. Therefore, this paper reports on the results from an experimental study (N = 241) testing whether a sponsored post leads to more engagement and greater brand attitude when endorsed by a male vs. a female influencer, and whether the participants' gender moderates this effect. The results revealed no main effects of an influencer's gender, however, an interaction effect was found with participants' gender. More specific, and in line with social identity theory, results suggest that women perceive themselves to be more similar to the female compared to the male influencer, leading to stronger feelings of parasocial interaction, which in turn positively affect brand attitude and post engagement. For men, no differences were found between a male and female influencer on brand attitude nor post engagement through perceived similarity and parasocial interaction. These findings' implications will be discussed further.","[Hudders, Liselot; De Jans, Steffi] Univ Ghent, Dept Commun Sci, Korte Meer 11, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Hudders, Liselot] Univ Ghent, Dept Mkt, Ghent, Belgium",Ghent University; Ghent University,"Hudders, L (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Dept Commun Sci, Korte Meer 11, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",Liselot.Hudders@Ugent.be,,,,,,,68,5,5,23,61,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0265-0487,1759-3948,,INT J ADVERT,Int.

Yet, despite their established coexistence, there is not enough evidence on the mechanism that takes place to affect consumers' attitude toward the ad (Aad). The present study builds on the scarce evidence on the combination of visual metaphors with white space to decipher the role of white space on the effectiveness of metaphoric advertising. A content analysis of 405 international print ads establishes the widespread use of visual metaphors (fusions) with extended white space (monochrome, in shades of grey). Based on Berlyne's theory of aesthetic preference this study proposes a serial mediation model with novelty, arousal, aesthetic response, and pleasure as successive mediating factors on the impact of visual metaphors (and especially visual metaphors with white space) on Aad. Three between-subjects (two with a Greek sample and one with U.S. and U.K. sample) experiments provide solid evidence in support of the proposed model. The attested sequence of effects fire starts a discussion on the significant creative opportunities and the associated communication implications for both academics and practitioners.","[Margariti, Kostoula; Boutsouki, Christina] Aristotles Univ Thessaloniki, Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Econ, Thessaloniki, Greece; [Hatzithomas, Leonidas] Univ Macedonia, Sch Business Adm, Dept Business Adm, Thessaloniki, Greece; [Zotos, Yorgos] Cyprus Univ Technol, Dept Commun & Internet Studies, Anexartisias 94, CY-3040 Limassol, Cyprus",Aristotle University of Thessaloniki; University of Macedonia; Cyprus University of Technology,"Zotos, Y (corresponding author), Cyprus Univ Technol, Dept Commun & Internet Studies, Anexartisias 94, CY-3040 Limassol, Cyprus.",yorgos.zotos@cut.ac.cy,"Hatzithomas, Leonidas/M-4450-2016","Hatzithomas, Leonidas/0000-0002-1478-725X; Boutsouki, Christina/0000-0003-3190-120X",,,,,116,2,2,9,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0265-0487,1759-3948,,INT J ADVERT,Int.

Such judgments would include the expected themes and feelings to be experienced from viewing ads of a product category. This is a vital undertaking because consumers' judgments of typicality are used in judgments of originality (divergence)-a key dimension of creative ads. However, the nature of ad typicality judgments remains mostly unexplained. Specifically, researchers have not offered rich explanations regarding the antecedents of ad-typicality judgments, or the complex effects of ad-typicality judgments regarding attitude toward the ad.

However, many marketers have not systematically employed the online search keywords data in developing efficient online search advertisements. While previous studies showed that search keywords can deliver intent of online users, to our knowledge, there have been few studies that empirically predict and analyze the behaviour of online users by segmenting their search keywords. Given this gap, this research contributes to online search advertising literature by examining segment-specific differences in terms of online users' behaviours and advertisers' costs. By using text analysis, we classify 9,355 search keywords from a major online auto insurance company in South Korea into four segments. Our results demonstrate that each segment shows different click behaviours at each stage of the online purchase decision process. In particular, the segment typing a specific brand name shows significantly higher click through rate (CTR) and estimate-to-purchase conversion rate (EPR) than other segments. On the other hand, the two segments typing specific product name or typing price-related words, who might be under a higher competition, show significantly higher click-to-estimate conversion rate (CER) than other segments. We also found that costs are significantly different across the four segments and advertisers pay more for the two segments under a higher competition. Thus, marketers will be able to improve their targeting strategies or advertising efficiency by redistributing their advertising budget across segments identified by the search keywords.","[Kim, Sunghoon] Rutgers State Univ, Mkt, Rutgers Business Sch, Newark, NJ USA; [Kim, Sunghoon] Rutgers State Univ, Rutgers Business Sch, Mkt, New Brunswick, NJ USA; [Kang, Moon Young] Soongsil Univ, Dept Entrepreneurship & Small Business, Seoul, South Korea",Rutgers State University Newark; Rutgers State University New Brunswick; Rutgers State University New Brunswick; Soongsil University,"Kang, MY (corresponding author), Soongsil Univ, Dept Entrepreneurship & Small Business, Seoul, South Korea.",mkang@ssu.ac.kr,,,,,,,54,4,4,3,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0265-0487,1759-3948,,INT J ADVERT,Int.

Findings from Study 1 demonstrated that, for a large company, the national cause led to more favourable attitudes toward the ad and the company, and a more socially responsible corporate image than the local cause. By comparison, for a small company, the local cause produced more positive attitudes toward the ad and the company, and a more socially conscious corporate image than the national cause. Further delving into the cognitive mechanism of this fit effect, Study 2 investigated the mediating role of message credibility and explored how the mediation varied with consumers' level of cause involvement. A series of moderated mediation analyses showed that when company size and cause proximity were congruent, participants displayed higher message credibility, which led to more favourable attitudes toward the ad and the company and a better corporate image than in an incongruent condition.
